# Siblings as Playmates: 5 Ways to Help Prevent Squabbles 

## Siblings (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/Pages/Sibling-Synergy.aspx) are often a child's first playmates. But as 

## any parent knows, that doesn't mean they'll always play together peacefully. Kids have difficulty seeing things from 

## other people's perspectives (/English/healthy-living/emotional-wellness/Building-Resilience/Pages/diverse-and

## inclusive-books-for-children.aspx), and naturally assume that the world revolves around them. Some children—like 

## those with ADHD (/English/health-issues/conditions/adhd/Pages/Understanding-ADHD.aspx) or autism 

## (/English/health-issues/conditions/Autism/Pages/Autism-Spectrum-Disorder.aspx)—need help thinking about each 

## other's minds, or how to coordinate their behaviors with someone else's. 

## Here are some ideas for trying to set up kids for thinking collaboratively when they play (/English/family-life/power

## of-play/Pages/the-power-of-play-how-fun-and-games-help-children-thrive.aspx). 

## Prompt them to be partners 

## As they run outside or start to wrestle in the hallway, give them a hint of how they could play as a team. 

## Think of characters they love. For example: "Hey, you be Harry and you be Hermione! Pretend you’re 

## heading into the Forbidden Forest." Or suggest one sibling be the teacher, one the student. One child 

## could be the shopper, the other the check-out person. Make sure they switch roles after a while. 

## Find a board game that involves working together 


### Look for games that encourage collaboration to solve the problem. Building activities, strategy games 

### and word searches or hidden picture games are great to do together. 

## Create a silly turn-taking drawing 

### Have one child draw something ("one day, an alligator woke up..."), and the other embellish it with 

### something silly ("...and he put on roller skates...") and so on. Tell a story piece by piece, and see where it 

### goes, and how ridiculous you can make it. 

## Use a turn-taking timer

### If kids are fighting over a toy, try having them set a timer for taking turns. Let them decide whether it will 

### be 5 minutes, 10, or more. Put them in charge of handing the toy over to their sibling when done—and 

### praise them when they do! 

## Have a kids versus grown-ups game 

### It could be a board game, soccer, catch or a scavenger hunt. And maybe consider letting the kids win 

### sometimes. 

### If your kids do wind up arguing, talk to them about how they want to be broken up when things get 

### heated (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/communication-discipline/Pages/Disciplining-Your

### Child.aspx). Where will their corners in your home be, to get a rest from each other? Or do they want 

### parents to stay out of it, and promise that they will do their best to solve the problem together?
