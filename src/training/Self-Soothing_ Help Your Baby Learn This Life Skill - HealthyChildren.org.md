# Self-Soothing: Help Your Baby Learn This Life Skill 

## By: Patti Ideran, OTR/L, CEIM & Mark Fishbein, MD, FAAP 

## In discussions about helping babies learn to fall asleep 

## on their own, you may hear "self-soothing" mentioned a 

## lot. The term can sometimes be interpreted as a parent 

## making a baby "cry it out" or ignoring their cries. This is 

## absolutely not true. 

## Allowing babies to learn calming strategies gives them 

## an important life skill. Leading by example and 

## teaching good coping skills from the beginning helps 

## babies become happy, well-adjusted children. 

## Figuring out what your baby needs & what helps 

## Teaching how to self-soothe involves a learning curve for you as well as your baby. If your baby is extremely irritable, 

## for example, they may be hungry (and then you need to feed them) or very tired (and then you need to try to help 

## them sleep). If you think your baby is in pain, you need to address that. 

## If all of these are ruled out and your baby is fed, changed, and well rested but fussy, then you can try a progression of 

## calming techniques (see below). 

## Too often, when your baby is crying (which may seem like all the time!), you may have the instinct to immediately pick 

## them up. Instead, next time try slow down and take steps to really learn about your baby and what they need 

## (/English/ages-stages/baby/crying-colic/Pages/Responding-to-Your-Babys-Cries.aspx). Try each technique slowly, and 

## pause to see how your baby responds; you will both learn what helps and what doesn't. 

## Soothing techniques to try 

## The order of the progression is important because you are doing less at the beginning by just using your voice and 

## more at the end when you are holding and possibly feeding your baby. The goal is for your baby to calm with less 

## intervention from you, and for you to move away from holding your baby all day, something that happens frequently 

## with fussy babies. 

## The CALM Baby Method progression 

## Look at your baby, letting them see your eyes. 

## Look at and talk to them. 

## Put a hand on their belly or chest. 

## Hold their arms together in toward the body or curl their legs up toward their belly. 

## Change their position by rolling them onto their side (while awake, only). 

## Pick up your baby and hold them in your arms or at your shoulder (but don't move yet!). 

## Hold and rock your baby. 

## Swaddle your baby and rock them. 

## Place a pacifier in their mouth (or assist them to get their hand or thumb to their mouth to suck). You can 

## also try this earlier in the progression if your baby likes pacifiers. 


## Other strategies to help calm your baby 

#### Other strategies you can incorporate include massaging their back while you are holding them, singing to them, 

#### walking with them, and using white noise. When babies are extremely fussy, we tend to try many things to help them 

#### calm. But sometimes this means we are adding more stimulation to an already overwhelmed sensory system, and this 

#### can be backfire. 

#### You may hold them, walk around, change positions, pat, sing, pass them on to your partner, for example, and this is too 

#### much input. Some parents we have worked with choose an intense strategy, such as sitting on a gymnastics ball and 

#### bouncing; however, this is risky, as your baby's head control may not be strong enough to handle this intense 

#### movement or you could accidentally fall off the ball with your baby in your arms. 

## Give your baby time to settle down 

#### When babies are inconsolable, we advise parents to try one strategy (1 or 2 sensory inputs) for about 5 minutes before 

#### moving on the next. This may seem like a long time, but it allows your baby to process the sensations and gives them 

#### time to settle. A great position to try is the arm drape or "hanging out" position (holding the baby on your forearm 

#### facing the floor, their head near your elbow supported in your hand.) It may take a couple of minutes, and sometimes 

#### the crying may escalate before it starts to ease. 

#### Other things you can try include standing up and holding your baby firmly while they are sucking on a pacifier, 

#### shushing or patting them, and swaddling and rocking them. Just don't attempt all the strategies at once or in too 

#### quickly in a row, or they will get overstimulated! 

#### You can also try decreasing the intensity of the the interaction; talk more quietly, move more slowly, use less 

#### animation in your face. Try to stick with one method for five minutes; if it does not help your baby calm, move on to a 

#### different strategy and give that one five minutes. Give each strategy a good try before giving up. Every time your baby 

#### cries, try the strategy, and do this for at least a day to see if it helps your baby to make a change. If you feel like a certain 

#### strategy works some of the time, try that one first. 

#### Consistency is key when trying to establish some behaviors. Your baby might not stop fussing immediately. But when 

#### you use the strategy each time she cries, your baby may be getting used to it and may calm more quickly over time. 

#### Remember that one parent may have a strategy that works best for them, while the other has a different strategy that 

#### helps most, and this is absolutely fine! 

## Your growing baby 

#### As babies get older, their cries change, and so should your strategies to help them calm. Sometimes parents find a 

#### strategy that works well with their baby, such as doing squats with their baby in their arms, that is much more difficult 

#### to do with an older, heavier baby! Parents tend to stay with strategies that once worked and may be reluctant to try 

#### something different, fearing that it might not work. Babies can get too big for a baby swing, or a parent bouncing a 

#### baby while sitting on a gymnastic ball could be more difficult or even risk a fall as the baby gets heavier. Be open to 

#### when it is time to try something different that may be more suitable or safer for your baby as she grows. 

## Seek help when you need it 

#### Don't hesitate to talk with your pediatrician. If you and your baby are still frustrated, there are more resources that can 

#### help. Consider contacting a pediatric occupational therapist who specializes in treating infants, an infant mental 

#### health specialist, or a pediatric developmental psychologist. These professionals can help you understand your baby, 

#### help you learn how to read their cues, and help you promote self-regulation. Interview these professionals to make 

#### sure they have the professional experience you are looking for to have the best chance of success.
