# Developmental Milestones of Early Literacy 

## By: Laura Jana, MD, FAAP and Jennifer Shu, MD, FAAP 

## Some parents choose to read to their newborns even 

## before they can hold their heads up or focus their eyes 

## on the pages. We occasionally hear of those who start 

## even sooner—reading to their unborn children through 

## uterine walls. 

## Our take on this head start? Although babies are 

## thought to be able to hear (/English/tips-tools/ask-the

## pediatrician/Pages/I’m-pregnant-and-would-like-to

## sing-to-my-unborn-baby.aspx) well before they are 

## born, we wouldn't count on it making your baby 

## significantly smarter or more well-read. If you enjoy it, though, by all means, read away in anticipation of the day when 

## your baby will be able to join in on the fun more actively. 

## The good news is you won't have to wait too long. Just as there are well-defined and eagerly anticipated "motor" 

## milestones that include rolling (4 to 6 months), sitting (7 to 9 months), and walking (anywhere from 9 to 15 months), 

## there are equally well-defined and important milestones of early literacy. 

## For the sake of making this short and sweet, we listed some of the book-related behaviors of early childhood, many of 

## which have been developed by one of the country's most widely respected early literacy programs, Reach Out and 

## Read (see Reaching Out to Read on page 201). That way, you can recognize and celebrate each book-based milestone in 

## the months to come. 

## Around 3 months: Let the games begin. Your baby will begin to babble and imitate sounds and smile at the 

## sound of your voice. With his head held higher than in months past, he should now be developing a better grasp 

## not only of what you're reading to him (or at least the expressions on your face) but also the books themselves as 

## he learns to swipe at objects and attempts to bring them to his mouth. 

## Around 6 to 12 months: Taking an active interest. Between the ages of 6 and 12 months, your baby will develop 

## many new skills, including the ability to sit up tall with his head steady and grab at pages. Don't be surprised if 

## books end up in your baby's mouth, as this is not only to be expected but a good sign that he is interested in books 

## and wants to explore them further. This is the time to invest in some durable board and bath books, if you haven't 

## already, as they stand up the best to new teeth and drool and also contain plenty of color, simple objects, and 

## photographs of faces that babies seem to prefer. 

## Around 12 to 18 months: A hands-on experience. Not only should your baby be able to sit without support, 

## allowing him both hands free for holding books and turning board pages (albeit several at a time), but he's likely 

## to demonstrate his already well-developed love of reading by carrying his books around, eagerly handing them 

## Showered by books 

## If you ask us, there's no better way to decorate a nursery than by lining your baby's bookshelf with a new collection 

## of favorite children's books. Reach out to friends, family, and anyone else you can think of and ask them to share 

## the name(s) of their favorite children's books. Start collecting a few just for fun in anticipation, and remember to 

## put them on your baby registry. If you're fortunate enough to have someone offer, you can even suggest a book

## themed baby shower. 


#### to you to read, and answering your questions of "Where is the...?" by pointing to pictures with one finger. At this 

#### age, toddlers also learn to recognize when a book is upside down. If you've never thought about it before, this is 

#### actually a fundamentally important step toward reading! 

#### Around 18 to 24 months: Taking charge. By now your baby will not only have turned into a toddler but also a 

#### true book connoisseur adept at turning his own board-book pages. Paper pages may still take a while to fully 

#### master. Ask "What's that?" and your toddler is sure to respond by naming familiar pictures. Pause before 

#### completing the sentence in a favorite book, and your toddler will finish it for you. Listen in and you'll even hear 

#### him taking over your role as storyteller as he starts to recite the stories he knows best to his own loyal listeners 

#### (ie, dolls or stuffed animals).
