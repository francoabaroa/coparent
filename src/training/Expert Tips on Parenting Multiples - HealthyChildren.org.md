# Expert Tips on Parenting Multiples 

## A new baby brings change to any family routine, and multiples add their own unique 

## requirements. “It’s amazing how you adapt — you just do it and it becomes your new family 

## routine,” says pediatrician Shelly Vaziri Flais, M.D., FAAP, and author of a forthcoming book on 

## twins from the American Academy of Pediatrics. “You get really good at holding two babies at 

## once.” 

## Establishing a routine is crucial to managing multiples, advises Flais, a mother of four — 

## including twin four-year old boys. “Newborns primarily eat and sleep, so it’s best if you can 

## coordinate both of those activities.” 

## Synchronizing babies’ sleeping and eating routine is ideal, agrees Robert W. Steele, M.D, FAAP, on staff at the 

## department of pediatrics at St. John’s Children’s Hospital in Springfield, Mo. “You won’t survive if you don’t put them 

## on the same schedule. If one wakes up to eat, you need to feed the other one. Otherwise, you won’t get any sleep,” says 

## Dr. Steele, also the father of twin boys. 

## The same SIDS-prevention rules apply to multiples as well — most importantly, babies should be put to sleep on their 

## back. “In many instances, putting both babies together to sleep is fine, and even preferable,” says Steele. “In our case, 

## it wasn’t... since one would often wake the other.” 

## Recruiting Help 

## The first six to eight weeks at home are often the most challenging for parents as babies develop a routine. Parents of 

## multiples often need additional help, even if one parent stays at home. 

## Help from family and friends in the early weeks makes things more manageable, advises Steele. “If you can get help — 

## even for part of the day or part of the night — it makes things a whole lot easier.” 

## If you don’t have immediate family in the area, try reaching out to friends and neighbors, suggests Flais. “You might 

## be surprised at who will volunteer to help you with specific tasks, like holding the babies or feeding them. Reaching 

## out and asking for help is important, especially in the first three months.” 

## Managing Individuality 

## Multiples can be hard to tell apart, even if they are not identical. Finding a way to identify each child early on will help 

## you tell them apart until their individual characteristics and personalities emerge. 

## “Our twin boys are identical, so when they were young we dressed them in distinct color themes of blues and reds,” 

## says Flais. “This helped family and friends when they came over and made it easier for everyone to call them by their 

## names, instead of referring to them as ‘the twins.’ It also helped me later when I was trying to label photographs.” 

## Encouraging individuality in twins and other multiples is important at every age. “In our home we make sure that 

## each child gets some one-on-one time each week,” says Flais. “It may be as simple as just taking one of them to the 

## store alone. They get a parent all to themselves, and feel like they’re being listened to, and you can better appreciate 

## them as individuals.” 

## Setting the Example 

## Multiples are naturally fascinating and attract a lot of attention from family, friends, and the public — creating a 

## unique set of concerns. Try to plan ahead and prepare for how you will respond to such attention. 

## “You get a lot of strange comments, and you just can’t let it faze you,” says Flais. “When I hear ‘Oh, you’ve got your 

## hands full,’ I reply, ‘They’re good kids, I’m very lucky.’ I don’t want them to hear negative comments and think they’re 

## a burden to me. How you respond in front of your kids is important.”

### Using each child’s name and encouraging others to do so instead of saying “the twins” or “the triplets” is another 

### essential way to respect children’s individuality and help others recognize their differences. 

### When multiples become school age, the issue of one or separate classrooms emerges. Most families get to choose 

### whether multiple siblings will share a classroom, and some states have legislation supporting this choice. “Personally, 

### I think our boys spend so much time together they appreciate the time apart, but I know other parents are really 

### adamant that their kids stay together,” says Flais. 

## Finding Support 

### Raising twins or multiples is easier with the right support. Meeting other parents of multiples in your area is an 

### invaluable way to share knowledge and experience, says Steele. “Find out if there’s a multiples group in your town, 

### look for clothing sales, and take advantage of opportunities to pick up things in duplicate.” 

## Seeing More Multiples? 

### It’s true, multiple births are on the rise. According to the most recent data from the National Center for Health 

### Statistics, from 1980 to 1997 the number of twin births in the United States rose 52 percent (from 68,339 to 104,137), 

### and triplet and higher-order multiples rose 404 percent (from 1,377 to 6,737 births).
