# Urgent Care: Is It Worth the No Wait? 

## The best place for children to receive medical care is at 

## a pediatrician's office. But, sometimes kids don't wait for 

## office hours to get sick or injured. 

## So, what should you do for those times when your 

## baby runs a high fever during the night or your 

## young athlete hurts his wrist at a weekend practice? 

## It happens. 

## The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 

## recommends (http://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.2017-0629) 

## that in cases like these, you should never hesitate to call 

## your pediatrician's office first, even if you know the 

## office is closed. Pediatricians are very accustomed to taking phone calls at all times—day and night—and can often 

## deal with problems over the phone. You are not bothering your pediatrician by calling. 

## However, you may notice new facilities popping up in your neighborhood that advertise that they offer "urgent" care 

## services often with no appointments necessary. Before going to one of these clinics, the AAP recommends that your 

## first step be to call your pediatrician's office—your child's "medical home"—to discuss your child's needs. If your 

## pediatrician is unable to see you but believes your child should be examined, he or she will advise you on the most 

## appropriate place for your child to receive care and how quickly your child should be seen. 

## Types of Urgent Care Services: 

## Urgent care and nonemergency hospital-based acute care: These facilities handle medical issues that may 

## not require a visit to the emergency room but still deserve attention. They are often open after-hours and on 

## weekends. Keep in mind that the physicians and nurses who work at these centers may not have advanced 

## training in pediatrics and may not be comfortable treating infants and young children. Urgent care facilities are 

## generally considered a higher level of care than retail-based clinics. 

## Retail-based clinics (RBCs): These clinics are typically found inside supermarkets, pharmacies and retail 

## superstores. While they may seem convenient, they generally provide a very limited number of health care 

## services for adults and children. Nurse practitioners or physician assistants—often trained in family practice but 

## with limited pediatric training—typically staff RBCs; there is usually not a physician on site.

## What to Do If Your Child is Seen by Someone Other Than His or Her 

## Pediatrician: 

#### If your child is seen by someone other than his or her pediatrician—at one of the acute care services or clinics listed 

#### above—it is very important that you provide the clinic with accurate and complete medical information to receive 

#### the most appropriate care. 

#### Bring information to the clinic about whether your child's immunizations are up to date. 

#### Let the provider know if your child has any allergies to medications and list the medications your child is 

#### currently using (including the last dose) and medicines taken in the past. 

#### Don't forget to mention any conditions such as asthma, diabetes, etc. 

#### Request that information regarding the visit be sent to your pediatrician so he or she can maintain a complete 

#### picture of your child's care. If the clinic does not offer this service, be sure to get copies of the services your 

#### child received and share this information with your pediatrician as soon as possible. 

### The management of acute care for children under age 2 requires special 

### expertise. 

#### Therefore, the AAP does not recommend RBCs, telehealth services outside of the medical home, and those acute 

#### care services without pediatric expertise for children younger than 2 years.
