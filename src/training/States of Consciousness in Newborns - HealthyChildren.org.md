# States of Consciousness in Newborns 

## As you get to know your baby, you’ll soon realize that there are times when she’s very alert and 

## active, times when she’s watchful but rather passive, and times when she’s tired and irritable. You 

## may even try to schedule your daily activities to capitalize on her “up” times and avoid 

## overextending her during the “down” periods. Don’t count on this schedule, however. These so

## called states of consciousness will change dramatically in this first month. 

## There are actually six states of consciousness through which your baby cycles several times a 

## day. Two are sleep states; the others are waking states. 

## State 1 is deep sleep, when the baby lies quietly without moving and is relatively unresponsive. If you shake a rattle 

## loudly in her ear, she may stir a little, but not much. During lighter, more active sleep (State 2), the same noise will 

## startle her and may awaken her. During this light sleep, you also can see the rapid movements of her eyes beneath her 

## closed eyelids. She will alternate between these two sleep states, cycling through both of them within a given hour. 

## Sometimes she’ll retreat into these sleep states when she’s over stimulated, as well as when she’s physically tired. 

## As your baby wakes up or starts to fall asleep, she’ll go through State 3. Her eyes will roll back under drooping eyelids 

## and she may stretch, yawn, or jerk her arms and legs. Once awake, she’ll move into one of the three remaining states. 

## She may be wide awake, happy, and alert but relatively motionless (State 4). Or she may be alert, happy, and very active 

## (State 5). Or she may cry and flail about (State 6). 

## If you shake a rattle by your baby’s ear when she’s happy and alert (States 4 and 5), she’ll probably become quiet and 

## turn her face to look for the source of this strange sound. This is the time when she’ll appear most responsive to you 

## and the activity around her, and be most attentive and involved in play. 

## In general, it’s a mistake to expect much attention from a baby who is crying. At these times, she’s not receptive to new 

## information or sensations; what she wants instead is to be comforted. The same rattle that enchanted her when she 

## was happy five minutes earlier will only irritate her and make her more upset when she’s crying. As she gets older, 

## sometimes you may be able to distract her with an attractive object or sound so that she stops crying, but at this young 

## age, the best way to comfort her usually is to pick her up and hold her. 

## As your baby’s nervous system becomes more developed, she’ll begin to settle into a pattern of crying, sleeping, 

## eating, and playing that matches your own daily schedule. She still may need to eat every three to four hours, but by 

## the end of the month she’ll be awake for longer periods during the day and be more alert and responsive at those 

## times.
