# Why It’s Important to Take Care of Baby Teeth 

## By: Patricia Braun, MD, MPH, FAAP 

## Seeing your baby's first tooth (/English/ages

## stages/baby/teething-tooth-care/Pages/Babys-First

## Tooth-Facts-Parents-Should-Know.aspx) is an exciting 

## milestone! Most little ones will get their first (primary) 

## teeth around 6 months of age, though tiny teeth can 

## emerge as early as 3 months. 

## Did you know that cavities can develop as soon as your 

## baby has teeth? Since baby teeth will eventually fall out, 

## it might not seem all that important to take good care of 

## them. But as it turns out, your child's first teeth are 

## essential to the health of their permanent teeth—and the foundation for lifelong health. 

## These are just some of the reasons to take extra-good care of your child's first (primary) teeth. Read on to learn more. 

## How do cavities develop in baby teeth? 

## Cavities can form when the shiny surface of our teeth—the enamel—is harmed by common bacteria living in our 

## mouths. The bacteria feed on sugary substances left behind from what we eat and drink. In the process, they create 

## acids that attack tooth enamel, opening the door for tooth decay to start. 

## Even the natural sugars in breast milk and formula can kick-start the process of tooth decay. And even though 

## primary teeth start falling out when kids are around 6 years old, what happens before then will influence your child's 

## dental health over the long term. Research shows that diet and dental hygiene habits during a child's infant and 

## toddler years reduces the risk of tooth decay as they become older. 

## Why it's crucial to take good care of baby teeth 

## Even though we've made great strides in preventing tooth decay, it is the most common chronic health problem seen 

## in children. In fact, 23% of all kids will get cavities before their 5th birthday. Consider that: 

## Decayed baby teeth may need to be taken out by the dentist, which can be painful and frightening for your child 

## (and costly for your family). 

## Missing baby teeth leave gaps, causing nearby teeth to shift around. This can keep your child's permanent teeth 

## from coming in correctly, which might mean braces later on. 

## Kids (and adults) need healthy teeth to speak clearly and chew their food thoroughly, the first step in healthy 

## digestion. A bright, shining smile gives a child confidence, too—an essential part of making friends, getting along 

## in school and enjoying life. 

## 9 everyday steps for keeping your child's teeth healthy 

## Here are steps recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) for preventing cavities in babies and 

## young children. 

## No bottles in bed. Putting your child to sleep with a bottle allows the sugars found in formula and breast milk to 

## linger on teeth, setting the stage for tooth decay. (In fact, many doctors and dentists refer to early cavities as baby 

## bottle tooth decay (https://www.mouthhealthy.org/all-topics-a-z/tooth-decay-with-baby-bottles)). 

## Handle pacifiers, spoons and cups with care. Tooth decay-causing bacteria can easily move from mouth to 

## mouth. So, for example, you should avoid putting a pacifier in your mouth and then giving it to your child, or 

## tasting your baby's food before offering them a bite from the same spoon. 


### Cleanse little mouths after each meal. Even before your infant's first teeth break through, it is important to get 

### into a healthy routine. Wipe the gums with a clean, damp washcloth or gauze pad after each feeding. When baby 

### teeth come in, switch to a soft-bristled toothbrush with a smear (about the size of a grain of rice) of fluoride 

### toothpaste. Around your child's first birthday, create a healthy routine of brushing 2 times daily for 2 minutes 

### each time. Consider setting up a bedtime routine of brushing your child's teeth after their last feed, reading them 

### a book and then getting them to bed at a regular bedtime—brush, book, bed. 

### Introduce a cup around your child's first birthday. Teaching young ones to drink from a cup can help prevent 

### tooth decay. Plan to begin moving your child from the breast or bottle to a lidded cup around 12 months. Milk, 

### breast milk and formula can be given at mealtimes, but fill your child's cup with plain water in between. 

### Avoid using cups or bottles to soothe your child. When little ones get fussy, it's tempting to offer them a little 

### formula or milk, but this exposes little teeth to sugars for long periods. Use a regular pacifier to calm your child, 

### but be sure not to dip it in honey or any other sweetener. 

### Skip the sugary drinks. Fruit juice, soda and sweetened drinks aren't good for your little one's teeth. In fact, the 

### AAP does not recommend juice for babies under 12 months. After that, limit juices to 4 ounces per day and mix 

### them with water (half-water, half-juice is best). See "Recommended Drinks for Children Age 5 & Younger 

### (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Recommended-Drinks-for-Young-Children-Ages-0-5.aspx).") 

### Limit sticky fruits and treats. Some foods can cling to a child's teeth, giving bad-guy bacteria plenty of sugar to 

### feast on. Sticky foods that promote tooth decay include raisins and other dried fruits, gummy candies, taffy, fruit 

### roll-ups and snack bars with honey or molasses. Try to limit these foods in your child's diet and have kids brush 

### or rinse with plain water after eating them. 

### Make water the family drink of choice. Regular tap water, which usually contains fluoride to strengthen tooth 

### enamel, is the healthiest drink for your child's teeth. Drinking plenty of water cleanses your child's mouth and 

### helps maintain saliva flow, which also washes away decay-causing bacteria. 

### Learn more about fluoride. Decades of studies have shown that fluoride is a superhero 

### (https://www.mouthhealthy.org/how-fluoride-fights-cavities) in fighting tooth decay. Most kids get the fluoride 

### they need from tap water and toothpaste that delivers fluoride. Your pediatrician or dentist may also apply a 

### fluoride varnish to your child's teeth, a helpful step 2-4 times a year that can continue as your child grows. 

### Not sure if your local water supply has fluoride? Use this online map 

### (https://nccd.cdc.gov/doh_mwf/default/default.aspx) to find out. If you're wondering about fluoride safety, read what a 

### dentist who's also a mom (https://www.mouthhealthy.org/life-stages/babies-and-kids/moms-guide-to-fluoride) has to 

### say. 

## When should I take my child to the dentist? 

### When your baby's first tooth appears, it's time to schedule their first dental visit. This is the ideal time to learn more 

### about dental care for kids and what you'll need to do as they grow. 

### Over time, your dentist can help you set up a healthy family routine, explaining everything from how to teach little 

### hands (https://www.mouthhealthy.org/life-stages/babies-and-kids/fun-ways-to-encourage-kids-to-brush) to brush 

### and floss to fitting young athletes with the right mouthguard (https://www.mouthhealthy.org/all-topics-a

### z/mouthguards). 

## The role your pediatrician plays 

### Since babies see the doctor several times before their first birthday, pediatricians have the opportunity to check inside 

### little mouths. It can be difficult to spot warning signs in baby teeth, so your pediatrician's expert eye is especially 

### helpful. 

### Studies suggest that breastfeeding during a child's first year can help reduce the risk of tooth decay by half. This 

### may be because of other effects breast milk has the immune system or microbiome (/English/tips-tools/ask

### the-pediatrician/Pages/Can-probiotics-help-prevent-tummy-trouble.aspx) (the balance of good and bad 

### bacteria). Still, whether you give your baby breast milk or formula, you should wipe their gums and any erupting 

### teeth after feedings to minimize risk of decay.

### As your child grows, your pediatrician will offer tips and suggestions that support the expert care your family dentist 

### will provide. They can also apply fluoride varnish to your child's teeth in partnership with your child's dentist. In 

### addition, In addition, pediatricians can help parents learn more about special risks that make some children more 

### cavity-prone. For example, preemies often have weaker tooth enamel than babies born at full term. Certain health 

### conditions and medicines can reduce saliva flow, making brushing and flossing even more important. 

## Making cavity prevention a family priority 

### Kids learn from the adults around them. That's why parents and caregivers should take excellent care of their own 

### teeth. As one dentist puts it: "Bad teeth don't necessarily run in the family, but bad dental habits do." 

### Set a positive example by letting little ones watch while you brush and floss. Explain that this is something we do twice 

### a day, morning and night, even when we're away from home. Mark dental appointments on the family calendar, which 

### shows kids that regular checkups are a top priority. Some children benefit from going to the dentist more than every 6 

### months to help them avoid getting cavities or keep cavities that have already started from getting worse. 

### Encourage good habits by adding fun to your child's routine. Toddlers and preschoolers may enjoy brushing to music 

### (https://www.mouthhealthy.org/kids-brushing-playlist) or marking their progress on a tooth care calendar 

### (https://www.mouthhealthy.org/resources/activity-sheets/brushing-calendar). The American Dental Association 

### offers free coloring and craft sheets (https://www.mouthhealthy.org/resources) you can download and share, too. 

## Remember 

### Healthy baby teeth set the stage for a lifetime of good dental health. Teeth play a crucial role in helping us speak 

### clearly, smile confidently and chew our food thoroughly, which nourishes our bodies for overall good health. 

### Setting a good example helps prevent tooth decay now and in the future. 

### Along with your family dentist, your pediatrician plays a key role in caring for your child's mouth and teeth.
