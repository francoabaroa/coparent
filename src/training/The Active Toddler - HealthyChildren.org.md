# The Active Toddler 

## Physical activity is important for children of all ages. Of course, it may seem that your own 

## toddler gets all the exercise he needs as he’s constantly on the move from sunup to bedtime. He’s 

## crawling, walking, learning to run and jump, climbing onto and down from furniture without help, 

## and kicking a ball or pulling toys behind him while walking. 

## By 2 to 3 years of age, your child’s physical activity will move to even more challenging levels. As 

## his coordination keeps improving, he’ll be able to walk up and down stairs. He’ll run easily and 

## start learning to pedal a tricycle. With his short attention span, he may be moving from one 

## activity to the next, almost minute by minute, keeping you on the run just to stay up with him. 

## We can’t overemphasize how important this active play is. To encourage it in your toddler, you should be discouraging 

## him from watching TV. The AAP believes strongly that children up to 2 years should not be watching any TV, choosing 

## instead to participate in supervised physical activity outdoors and indoors. Encourage them to play with siblings or 

## other children their own age. When planning family activities, make them as active as possible. 

## You can also promote physical activity (/English/healthy-living/fitness/pages/Encouraging-Your-Child-to-be

## Physically-Active.aspx) by using the stroller judiciously. When you’re out for a walk, don’t automatically sit your 

## toddler in the stroller for the entire trip. Let him get out and walk beside you if that’s what he wants to do. 

## If your toddler attends child care, find out how active he is there. In too many child care settings, the TV set and not the 

## kids gets a real workout during the day. Safety should also be a big concern while your toddler is in the child care 

## setting whether he’s playing or eating. Request that he always be seated while being fed, rather than running around 

## with food in his mouth on which he could end up choking (/English/health-issues/injuries

## emergencies/Pages/Choking-Prevention.aspx).
