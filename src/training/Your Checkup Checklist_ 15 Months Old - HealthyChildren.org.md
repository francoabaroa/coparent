# Your Checkup Checklist: 15 Months Old 

## You now have a full-fledged toddler to keep up with! 

## Those first tentative steps have likely given way to 

## determined dashes to explore everything around them. 

## This is a great time to talk with your child's pediatrician 

## about creating a safe and structured environment that 

## also allows your fearless explorer freedom to learn 

## from their surroundings. 

## As usual, the doctor will also perform a physical exam 

## and check your child's progress toward important 

## milestones. Here's what else you can expect at the 15

## month checkup: 

## ✅ Immunizations 

## Depending on which vaccines your child got at the 6-and 12-month visits, they may be due for DTaP (diphtheria, 

## tetanus and pertussis), Hib (haemophilus influenzae type B), PCV 13 (pneumococcal disease), measles, mumps and 

## rubella (/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Measles-Mumps-Rubella-Vaccines-What-You-Need-to

## Know.aspx)(MMR), or Varicella (chickenpox). They can also get Hep B (hepatitis B), inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) and 

## HepA (hepatitis A) doses now or at a later visit. If it's flu season, your doctor will also recommend an influenza 

## (/English/health-issues/conditions/chest-lungs/Pages/The-Flu.aspx) (flu) vaccine. 

## ✅ Screenings 

## The doctor may check your child for anemia (/English/health-issues/conditions/chronic/Pages/Anemia-and-Your

## Child.aspx) at this visit. Based on certain risk factors, they may also test blood pressure, hearing and vision. Unless 

## your child has already visited the dentist, your pediatrician will check for any new teeth that need an application of 

## fluoride varnish. Teeth that were treated with varnish at least 6 months ago get another application. 

## ✅Feeding & Development 

## Your pediatrician will measure and weigh your baby to make sure their growth (/English/health

## issues/conditions/Glands-Growth-Disorders/Pages/Growth-Charts-By-the-Numbers.aspx) is on track. They will also 

## observe their development and behavior and perform a physical exam. 

## Questions Your Pediatrician May Ask 

## Can your child drink from a cup with little spilling? 

## Do they look around when you say things like "Where's your ball?" or "Where's your blanket?" 

## Do they use at least 3 words other than names like "Mama" and "Dada?" 

## Can they squat to pick up objects? 

## Questions You May Have 

## How can I help my child learn to cooperate when playing with other children? 

## What should I do when my child doesn't finish their food at mealtime? 

## Is it OK for my child to sleep with a bottle? 

## What is the best way to react when my child misbehaves?
