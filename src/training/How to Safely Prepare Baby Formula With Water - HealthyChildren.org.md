# How to Safely Prepare Baby Formula With Water 

## By: Steven A. Abrams, MD, FAAP 

## Infant formula comes in three forms (/English/ages

## stages/baby/formula-feeding/Pages/Forms-of-Baby

## Formula.aspx): powder formula, concentrated liquid 

## formula and ready-to-feed (non-concentrated) formula. 

## If you use infant formula for your baby, no matter which 

## form, be sure to follow directions closely. Formula that 

## is diluted with too much water, for example, can cause 

## serious health and development problems for your 

## baby. It's also important to use clean water for a safe 

## source (/English/safety-prevention/all

## around/Pages/Is-Your-Drinking-Water-Safe.aspx) free 

## of bacteria or other microorganisms that may cause disease, and low in certain minerals and contaminants that may 

## be harmful. Read on to learn more. 

## When to add water & how much to use 

## Non-concentrated, ready-to-feed formula 

## Do not add any water non-concentrated, ready-to-feed formula. Remember, diluting it can be dangerous for your child 

## (see below). 

## Concentrated liquid formula & powder formula 

## Use water to prepare concentrated liquid formula and powder formula, but only as directed. Use a safe water source as 

## defined by your state or local government. Unless there is a known contamination of your local water source, you can 

## use tap water (https://www.fda.gov/food/people-risk-foodborne-illness/questions-answers-consumers-concerning

## infant-formula#11) to prepare concentrated liquid or powdered formula. In general, though, it is best to primarily use 

## safe tap water that is fluoridated (https://aapms365

## my.sharepoint.com/personal/gbrown_aap_org/Documents/downloaded%20images/(https:/www.cdc.gov/fluoridation 

## /faqs/infant-formula.html)) and occasionally use some non-fluoridated bottled water. 

## Why watering down formula is dangerous 

## News reports have found parents diluting formula to try and save money or feeding water in addition to breast 

## milk or formula. This can lead to a dangerous condition called water intoxication. 

## Babies in the first 6 months after birth do not need water or other liquids such as juices in addition to 

## formula or breast milk, unless specifically advised by a pediatrician. Adding extra water to formula or giving 

## juices reduces the about of nutrients baby will receive. This can slow growth and development. Extra water also 

## disturbs electrolyte and mineral balances such as calcium, sodium and potassium which can lead to major health 

## problems including seizures. So always mix formula as directed by the manufacturer unless specifically guided to 

## change these instructions for infants with special health needs. 

## If you're using formula but having trouble affording it (/English/tips-tools/ask-the-pediatrician/Pages/how

## should-we-feed-our-baby-if-running-low-on-money.aspx) check with your pediatrician, local health 

## department, food pantry or social service agency. 


## How to mix powder formula & water to prepare a bottle 

#### The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides detailed instruction 

#### (https://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/downloads/prepare-store-powered-infant-formula-508.pdf) on preparing infant 

#### formula. Also look for instructions on the formula can labels, and from other reliable sources including state WIC 

#### agencies (https://www.signupwic.com/). There are a few key points to remember: 

#### 1. Water first, then powder. Always add the powder to the water that is in the bottle, not the other way around. 

#### 2. Boil the water when needed. For infants under 3 months of age, those who were born prematurely and those 

#### who have a weakened immune system, hot water should be used to prepare formula to kill any microbes. To do 

#### this, boil the water and let it cool for about 5 minutes. Then, add it to a clean bottle and add the formula based 

#### on the instructions on the container. 

#### 3. Cool formula to body temperature. If you are going to use the formula you prepared immediately, be sure to 

#### cool the formula to body temperature before feeding your baby. Run the prepared, capped bottle under cool 

#### water or place it into an ice bath. 

#### 4. Test the formula temperature to make sure it is not too hot before feeding it to your baby (see below). 

## How long is the bottle of formula good for after making it? 

#### Prepared formula must be discarded within 1 hour after feeding it from the bottle to your baby. 

#### Prepared formula that has not been fed to your baby may be stored in the refrigerator for 24 hours to prevent 

#### bacterial contamination (/English/health-issues/conditions/abdominal/Pages/Food-Poisoning-and-Food

#### Contamination.aspx). 

#### An open container of ready-to-feed formula, concentrated formula, or formula prepared from concentrated 

#### liquid formula, should be covered, refrigerated and discarded after 48 hours if not used.

### How to test the temperature of you baby's bottle 

#### Test warmed water in advance to make sure it is not too hot for your baby. The easiest way to test the temperature 

#### is to shake a few drops on the inside of your wrist. Otherwise, a bottle can be prepared by adding powdered 

#### formula and room temperature water from the tap just before feeding. Bottles made in this way from powdered 

#### formula can be ready for feeding, as no additional refrigeration or warming would be needed.
