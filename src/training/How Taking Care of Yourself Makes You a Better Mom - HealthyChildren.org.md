# How Taking Care of Yourself Makes You a Better Mom 

## By: Kelly Ross, MD, FAAP 

## Mothering is hard work. It is constant work. It is so easy to stop 

## caring for yourself or to get overwhelmed (/English/family

## life/family-dynamics/Pages/Feeling-Overwhelmed-with-Parenting

## Demands.aspx). But, when you stop caring for yourself, your ability 

## to care for your child is impacted and your ability 

## to enjoy motherhood is impacted. 

## My Best Advice: Take Care of Yourself 

## As a pediatric hospitalist (/English/family-life/health

## management/pediatric-specialists/Pages/What-is-a-Pediatric

## Hospitalist.aspx), a good part of my career involves caring for new babies in two very different hospital settings. I have 

## been sending moms and babies home for 15 years now. Having watched them, and having gone through motherhood 

## myself, what would my " best advice for new moms ever" include? 

## It's something many women work hard to do throughout their pregnancy but stop once they hear that first baby 

## cry. It's something that has a rippling effect for decades. It costs nothing, but saves society millions. It is something 

## that is so hard to do at times and yet so vital. 

## So, what is my "best advice for new moms ever"? Take care of yourself. That's it, four little words. 

## When you are pregnant, it is easy to see why this one idea is so very important. 

## The little baby growing inside of you is directly affected by what you eat, drink and do. 

## If you smoke (/English/ages-stages/prenatal/Pages/Where-We-Stand-Smoking-During-Pregnancy.aspx), the 

## baby gets exposed and doesn't grow as well. 

## If you are chronically stressed or depressed (/English/healthy-living/emotional-wellness/Building

## Resilience/Pages/When-Things-Arent-Perfect-Caring-for-Yourself-Your-Children.aspx), your body's responsive 

## hormones cause a cascade of negative effects on your baby. 

## If you eat poorly (/English/ages-stages/prenatal/Pages/Nutrition-and-Exercise-During-Pregnancy.aspx), the baby 

## is at risk for poor growth. 

## But once the baby is no longer a part of your body, it is easy to forget that tight association between how you care 

## for yourself and how you care for your child's health. 

## It Isn't Selfish to Take Time to Exercise! 

## A mom who is well rested, eats a healthy diet, gets plenty of exercise, maintains close relationships with friends and 

## gets help when she realizes she isn't coping well, is far more equipped to be the best mother she can be than one who 

## doesn't do those things. It isn't selfish to take time to exercise or to get an adequate sleep each night. 

## I can remember when I was in middle school waking up to my mom returning from a training run with stories of "the 

## nice police man" who followed her while she was running to make sure she was safe. My mom is a trusting soul, she 

## often ran at 4:00 AM. Looking back, now that I am a mom, three things about that memory are clear: 

## 1. I no longer think she was crazy for running at 4:00 AM. It was the only down time she had as a mom, and she took 

## advantage of it rather that choosing not to exercise. 

## 2. Her example and those memories are deeply ingrained in me as "what moms do." 

## 3. That police man really was nice! Thank you officer for keeping her safe, so she could grow up to be a grandma! 


#### When I first became a mom, I didn't exercise. I felt it was selfish to take time away from the kids to do something for 

#### myself. I "didn't have time to exercise (/English/healthy-living/fitness/Pages/Overcoming-Obstacles-to-Physical

#### Activity.aspx) and be a good mom" with three little children. Honestly, some days it seemed to take an act of God to get 

#### 10 minutes to shower. 

#### When my triplets turned 2, I realized I wasn't strong enough to pull the wagon with all three of them, so I 

#### started going to the gym. Going to the gym not to take care of myself mind you, but to be able to take care of 

#### them. 

## Your Children Are Watching You... And Want to Be Like You! 

#### It wasn't until the kids were school aged that I truly realized that by being a "good mom" and not caring for myself, 

### I was actually falling short of my goal. Like the little boy in the Rodney Akins song, Watching You, 

### (http://www.cowboylyrics.com/lyrics/atkins-rodney/watching-you-17224.html) one day I realized " they were watching 

### me." 

#### If I never drank water, how could I ask them to drink 8 glasses a day? If I never exercised, how could I tell them 

#### it was important to exercise in order to be healthy (/English/healthy-living/fitness/Pages/Encouraging-Your-Child

#### to-be-Physically-Active.aspx)? And so, like my mother had, I began to figure out how to find time to exercise even 

#### when I didn't feel like I had time. 

#### I also realized, like the spokes on my bike wheels, that one effort can branch into so much goodness. Biking 

#### (/English/healthy-living/sports/Pages/Biking.aspx) has made me feel healthier and have more energy. My clothes fit 

#### better, and what woman doesn't like that? I have a whole new group of friends to ride with, or as my one bike friend's 

### husband says "to get out on the road and solve the world's problems" together. And through charity rides 

#### (/English/family-life/Community/Pages/Creating-Opportunities-for-Children-Teens-to-Contribute.aspx) and the 

#### kindness of others, I have raised a great deal of money for multiple sclerosis (MS) and cancer (/English/health

#### issues/conditions/cancer/Pages/Childhood-Cancer-Coping-With-the-Diagnosis.aspx) research. 

### If you look at all of that through the eyes of your little buckaroo who is "watching you" and "wants to be just like 

### you," know you truly are being a good mom by being a good example.
