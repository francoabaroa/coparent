# Your Child's Health Story 

## As a parent, you know your child best. You know your child’s favorite foods and the games he or 

## she likes to play. You know your child as an individual, but also as an important member of your 

## family. 

## When you’re working with your child’s doctor, it can be helpful to share your insights. 

## One way to do that is to create a resume of sorts, a printed form you can leave with the doctor that 

## explains who your child is within the family and outlines his or her medical history. This can also 

## be a great tool for you, putting all your child’s medical information in one place. 

## Don’t forget to include a photograph. Now each time the doctor opens the medical chart, he or she see the whole child, 

## not just a medical history.
