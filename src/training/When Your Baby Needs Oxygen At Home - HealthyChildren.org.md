# When Your Baby Needs Oxygen At Home 

## By: Folasade I Kehinde, MD, MPH, FAAP 

## Chronic respiratory conditions can cause levels of 

## oxygen in the blood to drop too low. When this happens, 

## it is called hypoxemia. Children with hypoxemia may 

## need to have oxygen therapy at home once they are 

## discharged from the hospital. This helps them maintain 

## normal blood oxygen levels so they can stay healthy. 

## Understanding hypoxemia 

## Like a fever, hypoxemia is a symptom of an underlying 

## condition--not an illness itself. It can be caused by a 

## variety of conditions and illnesses, not just respiratory ones. 

## Some of the chronic respiratory conditions that can cause hypoxemia include: 

## Bronchopulmonary dysplasia 

## Sleep-disordered breathing (sleep apnea (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/Sleep-Apnea-Detection.aspx)) 

## Sickle cell disease (/English/health-issues/conditions/chronic/Pages/sickle-cell-disease-in-children.aspx) 

## Pulmonary hypertension (/English/health-issues/conditions/heart/Pages/Pulmonary-Hypertension-in-Infants

## Children.aspx) with or without congenital heart disease 

## Cystic fibrosis (/English/health-issues/conditions/chronic/Pages/Cystic-Fibrosis.aspx) 

## Interstitial lung disease 

## Children with airway problems 

## Children who are (or were) dependent on a ventilator for breathing 

## If it is left untreated, hypoxemia can create issues like: 

## Poor feeding 

## Poor growth 

## Poor sleep 

## Poor brain development 

## Dangerous drop in heart rate (/English/health-issues/conditions/heart/Pages/Irregular-Heartbeat

## Arrhythmia.aspx#%3a~%3atext=Irregular%20heartbeats%2c%20also%20called%20arrhythmias%2c%20are%20a 

## %20common%2cthe%20heart%20when%20they%20breath%20in%20or%20out.) (bradycardia) 

## Short periods of not breathing (apnea) 

## Using oxygen at home 

## Babies who are medically stable and whose parents have been trained can be sent home on oxygen to prevent 

## hypoxemia. Being at home benefits both your child's and your family's emotional health. Caring for your baby at home 

## also helps reduce healthcare costs.

### For home use, most babies get oxygen through a nasal cannula, a small tube that fits in your baby's nostrils and 

### secures around the head. In a small number of babies, oxygen is delivered through a tube in the neck called a 

### tracheostomy, a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine or a ventilator. 

### Your doctor will prescribe how much oxygen your baby needs. This is usually written as a specific flow rate (for 

### example, ¼ liter of oxygen per minute) when a nasal cannula is used. For a ventilator or CPAP machine, your doctor 

### will prescribe the settings you will need for the machine. 

## Home oxygen delivery systems 

### There are three main types of oxygen delivery systems used at home, including: 

### Compressed gas. This is the most common type. Small, pre-filled tanks of oxygen are delivered to your home before 

### your baby is discharged from the hospital. The number of tanks you get depend on how much oxygen your baby 

### needs. You may also get a big, non-portable gas tank. A representative from the durable medical equipment (DME) 

### company you use will show you how to read the gauges so you can tell when you need to refill your tanks. 

### Oxygen concentrator. This device separates oxygen out of the air and gives it to your baby. It's usually sent to your 

### home and it runs on electricity. Someone from the medical equipment company will show you how to use the 

### concentrator. A portable backup oxygen tank is needed, too, for times when your baby isn't near an electrical outlet 

### and just in case there's a power outage. 

### Liquid oxygen. Oxygen that has been cooled to a liquid state is stored in tanks. The liquid changes into gas as your 

### baby breathes it in. One of the reasons this system is not used as often is because liquid oxygen is expensive and 

### insurance companies may not cover the cost. A liquid oxygen tank takes up much less space than a large compressed 

### oxygen tank, but a big disadvantage of liquid oxygen is that it evaporates when it is not being used. 

## Other equipment 

### Depending on the reason your baby needs oxygen therapy, an apnea monitor or a pulse oximeter may be used. 

### An apnea monitor is a device that uses chest leads or best around the chest to monitor your baby's breathing rate and 

### heart rate. The machine alerts you when your baby's breathing rate slow or heart rate drops, which could be a sign of 

### respiratory distress. A pulse oximeter is a machine that uses a small band wrapped around your baby's hand or foot to 

### measure the oxygen levels in the blood. 

### You will receive instructions on how to use these machines before your baby leaves the hospital. Your doctor will also 

### explain what readings mean you need to call your health care provider. Keep in mind that an alarm may not always 

### signal distress, so it is important to look at your baby's breathing, color, and activity. 

## Safety precautions when using oxygen at home 

### Any time a baby is sent home from the hospital on oxygen, there are safety precautions you should follow: 

### Your baby's room should be well ventilated. You can keep the door open to ensure that the room has good air 

### flow and is not too stuffy. 

### There should be no smoking (/English/health-issues/conditions/tobacco/Pages/Importance-of-Smoke-Free

### Homes-and-Cars.aspx) in the house when a baby is receiving oxygen. You can hang a sign on the door to let 

### people know not to smoke in the house. Ask your medical equipment provider or your pediatrician's office for a 

### sign. 

### Oxygen is a flammable gas, so when your baby is on oxygen, keep your baby at least six feet away from open 

### flames, heaters, fireplaces, radiators or gas appliances with pilot lights. Make sure you also store all oxygen tanks 

### at least six feet away from any source of heat or fire. 

### Do not use rubbing alcohol, petroleum jelly or spray cans near a baby on oxygen. Avoid using hand sanitizer 

### (/English/health-issues/conditions/COVID-19/Pages/Keep-Hand-Sanitizer-Out-of-Childrens

### Reach.aspx) nearby, too. 

### Make sure that the smoke detectors in your home are working and periodically review your home fire escape 

### plan with your family.

## What else to expect 

### Learn before you leave. In the last few days before your baby comes home from the hospital, you should get familiar 

### with the equipment you will be using at home, as well as how to care for your baby. The best way to learn all this is by 

### spending as much time as you can caring for your baby at the bedside while in the neonatal intensive care unit 

### (/English/ages-stages/baby/preemie/Pages/How-You-Can-Participate-in-the-Care-of-Your-Baby-in-the-NICU.aspx) 

### NICU. This will allow you to learn from the health care team and practice while you have experts available to answer 

### questions. Some NICUs have a room for parents to stay with the baby the night before going home to help with the 

### transition. 

### Home nursing visits. Babies sent home on oxygen may have home nursing visits arranged through their insurance 

### by the doctor. The nurse will check on your baby and make sure you are using all your equipment properly. He or she 

### will also be happy to answer any questions you might have about caring for your baby. Most babies are weaned off 

### oxygen gradually based on recommendations from your child's doctor and a lung specialist called a pulmonologist. 

### Alert essential services. Make sure your health care team provides letters to give to your telephone company, 

### electric company and local emergency medical services (EMS) to alert them that you have a child with special needs 

### in your home. Keep the phone numbers to your physician, EMS or ambulance service in a convenient and easily 

### accessible place in your home in case of any life-threatening emergencies. 

## Remember 

### While it all may seem overwhelming at first, you will become a pro before you know it. Contact your child's doctor or 

### oxygen equipment provider with any questions.
