# The Benefits of Peer Pressure During Toilet Training 

## “I went to the bathroom with Eric today,” four-year-old Frank reports to his parents over dinner. “That’s nice, Frank,” 

## his dad says with a glance at his wife. “Did you use the potty all by yourself?” “I peed in the toilet!” Frank says proudly, 

## helping himself to more bread. “Eric peed, too. We made an X with our pee!” Frank’s parents exchange a smile as 

## Frank laughs with delight over his exploit. They know that the joy Frank takes in sharing his toilet-training skills with 

## a friend is a powerful motivator. 

## Preschoolers’ expanding social awareness—their love of observing and categorizing all aspects of their peers’ 

## behavior, from what they eat for lunch to whether they wear diapers or underpants—feeds a growing desire to be like 

## their friends. While this aspect of a child’s development can work against his toilet training progress at age two and a 

## half or three, when he may decide he wants to revert to diapers because so many children at the childcare center wear 

## them, it becomes a more positive force as toilet use becomes more common among his classmates. 

## You can take advantage of this natural tendency to conform by pointing out, in nonshaming, nonjudgmental ways, 

## which of the children your child knows have learned to use the potty. Keep in mind the fact that preschoolers are 

## more likely to imitate people they most like or admire. This is a time to keep an open mind about the many aspects of 

## toilet use that captivate young children. While we may not quite understand the thrill of sharing a bathroom stall with 

## a friend, communal voiding has helped many a preschooler succeed at and enjoy toilet training. 

## Your preschooler is certainly thrilled to learn the ways he is like and unlike the children he knows, but this is a time 

## when a strong urge to conform with same-gender adult behavior manifests itself as well. Fascinated as they often are 

## by the concept of gender, threeand four-year-olds still have a limited understanding of what constitutes “maleness” 

## and “femaleness.” They are easily confused—assuming that a teenage boy with a ponytail is a girl or that a girl with 

## short hair and a baseball cap is a boy. 

## Bathroom use is one obvious way to discern differences between genders and to solidify one’s own sense of gender. As 

## a result, your male preschooler may take great pride in urinating standing up “just like Daddy,” while a girl this age 

## may enjoy using the potty while Mommy puts on her makeup nearby. Again, it’s best to use this natural tendency to 

## categorize in your child’s favor. 

## Wanting to use the bathroom “like a boy” or “like a girl” is a signal that your child is exploring all aspects of what it 

## means to be himor herself.
