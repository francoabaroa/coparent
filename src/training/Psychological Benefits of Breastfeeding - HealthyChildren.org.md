# Psychological Benefits of Breastfeeding 

## Your newborn also benefits from the physical closeness of nursing. Thrust from the close, dark 

## womb into an overwhelming experience of bright lights, loud noises, and new smells, your baby 

## needs the reassurance of your continued physical presence. 

## By holding him safe in your arms and giving nourishment from your body, you offer him a sense 

## of continuity from preto post-birth life. Gazing into your eyes, your baby comes to understand 

## that he is loved and protected and that you are there to provide for his needs as he adjusts to this 

## new world. 

## In addition, breastfeeding releases hormones in your body that promote mothering behaviors. This emotional bond is 

## as vital as the nutritional benefit he receives from you. Scientists now tell us that infants learn best in a context of 

## emotional closeness with an adult. Breastfeeding promotes a growing attachment between the two of you that will 

## continue to play an important role in your baby’s development for years to come.
