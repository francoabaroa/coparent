# How You Can Participate in the Care of Your Baby in the 

# NICU 

## During your first days in the NICU, you may feel like unwilling passengers on a ride you never 

## planned to take. You will notice the nurses providing all of the care for your baby, operating 

## complicated pumps, providing medications, changing diapers, tucking in blankets, and so much 

## more. Many parents wonder how they can “be” a parent at times like these when they aren’t 

## doing the “things” that parents usually do for their babies. 

## As you become more familiar with your baby’s care and preferences, you too will begin to provide 

## these routine care needs. Changing your baby’s diaper, taking a temperature, tucking in blankets, 

## changing clothes, and giving a bath are all skills you will learn; let your nurse know when you are 

## ready to begin learning how to provide these care needs. 

## Some parents fear that asking to participate in the care of their baby will “get in the way” of the nurse. Remember that 

## you are your baby’s parent. Your baby will go home with you, not the nurses. Rest assured that most nurses are eager 

## to help you become “the expert” in your baby’s care. Sometimes participation is simply “being there.” 

## Ask about your baby’s schedule, particularly about when feedings are provided, and when your baby is more awake. 

## Some NICUs welcome parents’ presence during procedures (IV starts, placement of peripherally inserted central 

## catheters, intubation). If you wish to be present during a procedure, please let your baby’s nurse or other care team 

## member know. If you stay in your baby’s room during a procedure, you may be asked to wear a mask or hair cover to 

## help prevent infection. If you begin to feel faint, nauseous, or emotional, let a member of the NICU team know right 

## away so that you can get support immediately. 

## If your NICU is in an academic institution and you are asked to step out during complex procedures, it is most likely 

## because the health care provider (a resident, for example) is still learning the procedure, asking questions, and 

## possibly requesting help from the supervising physician or neonatal nurse practitioner. In some cases, the procedure 

## is more likely to be successful if the health care provider is not under parent observation. 

## A provider’s comfort level with a parent’s presence during procedures varies among providers; therefore, it is all right 

## to ask the provider if you may stay. If you make it clear that you will step out at the provider’s request, you may be 

## more successful with making that person comfortable with your presence. 

## Learn About Common Terms, Phrases, and Problems 

## Simply having greater familiarity with the words and concepts you hear in rounds and around the NICU will help you 

## feel more a part of what is happening. Knowledge really is power. The more informed you are, the better you will 

## understand what is happening to your baby. Reading will help. Talking with other parents who have gone through a 

## NICU experience may help (here is where the “veteran” parents can be remarkably helpful). If you like detailed 

## information, ask your baby’s nurse or physician for written materials that explain what is happening to your baby. 

## Many NICUs have a guidebook for their parents that describes common procedures and roles of individuals in that 

## unit. Some NICUs have a parent resource center within the unit with books and even computers for parents to 

## research electronic resources. 

## When using the Internet for information. Keep in mind that anyone can post information and ideas on the Internet; 

## not all of it is accurate or even truthful. Ask for Web site recommendations from a parent educator, a family resource 

## center specialist, or a member of your baby’s care team. 

## Your NICU may also have a specialized parent support and training program to help familiarize you with your baby’s 

## anticipated NICU experience. The more you understand, the more effective an advocate you can be for your baby.
