# Bassinets and Cradles 

## For the first few weeks of a baby’s life, some parents prefer to use a bassinet or cradle because it’s 

## portable and allows the baby to sleep in their bedroom. But keep in mind that babies grow fast 

## and a cradle that’s sturdy enough for a 1-month-old may be outgrown by the next month. 

## Make sure the bottom of the cradle or bassinet is well supported to prevent its collapse. The 

## cradle or bassinet should also have a wide base so it won’t tip over even if someone bumps it; if it 

## has folding legs, make certain that they’re locked straight whenever it is being used. In general, 

## your baby should move to a crib (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/New-Crib

## Standards-What-Parents-Need-to-Know.aspx) around the end of the first month of life or by the 

## time he weighs 10 pounds.
