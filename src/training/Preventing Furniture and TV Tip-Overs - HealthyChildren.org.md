# Preventing Furniture and TV Tip-Overs 

## When you think about keeping your child safe, you 

## may not consider the possibility of furniture or TVs 

## tipping over on them. 

## Unfortunately, tip-over incidents happen more than 

## many of us realize. They can cause serious injury and 

## even death. In fact, a child is rushed to the emergency 

## department at least once every single hour of every 

## single day with injuries from a furniture or TV tip-over. 

## How furniture can be dangerous 

## Not surprisingly, 77% of all tip-over deaths from 2000 to 

## 2019 involved kids under the age of six. Children this age are very curious and driven to explore. They're also too short 

## to reach the tops of tall pieces of furniture where irresistible items like TVs, tablets, and toys may reside. All of this can 

## translate to young children climbing furniture such as dressers, tables, chests, TV stands, and bookcases. 

## Tip-overs can also happen when furniture becomes unstable. This instability may be caused by factors like: 

## Heavy objects in or on top of the furniture, such as appliances or TVs 

## Multiple dresser drawers being open at the same time 

## A furniture design that has a heavy top 

## Placing the furniture on an unstable surface such as carpet 

## When a piece of furniture or appliance falls on a small child, it can crush or suffocate them under its weight. If it hits 

## them in the head, they can end up with a serious brain injury. Tip-overs can also cause internal bleeding and broken 

## bones. 

## You may be a parent who watches your child closely. However, no parent can have eyes on their child every 

## moment of the day. That's why it is critical to make your home environment as safe as possible. 

## Of the fatal incidents involving children, about 50% happen in bedrooms, sometimes when parents think their kids are 

## asleep. 

## You can't always stop your young child from climbing. But you can stabilize the furniture that could hurt them. Anti

## tip devices cost $5 to $25 and take just minutes to install. 


### Keeping My Promise to Meggie 

###### By Kimberly Amato 

##### On December 17th, 2004, I kissed my 3-year-old twins goodnight. I was looking 

##### forward to baking Christmas cookies with them and their older brother in the 

##### morning. Instead, I woke that to my husband frantically screaming my name. 

##### My daughter, Meghan, was found under her dresser, and she wasn't breathing. 

##### We didn't hear the dresser fall. She was unable to cry, her airway crushed by the 

##### weight of the dresser that fell on top of her while the rest of our family was 

##### asleep. I called 911 and began CPR, but it was too late. 

##### As I held her lifeless body in the emergency room, I promised her she'd be the 

##### last child to ever die from a dresser tip-over. Unfortunately, she wasn't. 

##### Hundreds more have died this way since. 

##### The more I learned about tip-overs, the more angry and determined I became to 

##### stop them. Furniture is not required to be tested for safety, which was shocking 

##### to me. There has been a safety standard for dressers and other "clothing storage units" for 20 years, but it's voluntary, 

##### weak and insufficient. Dressers that comply with the current standard, yet have injured and killed children, are still 

##### sold today. 

##### You can't tell by looking at a piece of furniture whether or not it's likely to tip over. Meghan's dresser was small, 

##### heavy, and well-made piece. It took two adults to move. Kids may interact with a piece of furniture 100 times. Each 

##### time, the physics is different based on "real world" factors: how many drawers they pull out or doors they open, 

##### what's in the drawers or on the shelves, what surface the furniture is on, whether they climb it and how high, how 

##### much the child weighs...the list goes on. 

##### We need mandatory safety and stability standards that require testing by manufacturers for these real-world 

##### situations. That's the goal of the Stop Tip-overs of Unstable Risky Dressers on Youth (STURDY) Act 

##### (https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/441/text). You can urge your Senators 

##### (https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members) to support The STURDY Act, using this quick form 

##### (https://act.consumerreports.org/mibjUUj) to send a letter. But, for now, it is up to parents and caregivers to take the 

##### final steps to reduce the risk of a tip-over. 

##### Help me keep my promise to Meggie. Start by realizing that a furniture or TV tip-over CAN happen to your family. 

##### No one who has ever lost a child to a tip-over, or any other preventable "accident," ever thought it would happen to 

##### them. Also know that you can be in the same room and be powerless to stop a tip-over. While many tip-overs happen 

##### when children are in a room alone, they also happen with an adult in the room with them. It only takes one time, and 

##### it happens in an instant. 

##### Please, anchor all your furniture to the walls. If you rent and putting holes in the walls violates your rental 

##### agreement, talk to the landlord and explain the importance of childproofing, including anchoring furniture and TVs 

##### to prevent injury or death to your child. Share the information here with them! 

##### Holes in furniture and in walls can be fixed. The hole in my broken heart will never, ever go away.

## How to prevent tip-overs 

##### Secure all furniture and mirrors with anti-tip devices. This may require relocating the furniture so the wall 

##### anchors can be placed in a stud. 

##### Consider using furniture and wall anchors that are metal (such as "L" brackets). Plastic can become brittle over 

##### time and break, causing anchors to fail. Counterfeit/knock off anchors are becoming a problem on some online 

##### sites. Use known brand name products, even if they are a little more expensive. 

##### The heavier the furniture, the more anchors you should use to prevent it from tipping. A resource list of 

##### recommended anchors can be found at here. (http://www.meghanshope.org/) 

##### In dressers and other clothing-storage furniture, place heavier objects on the lowest shelves/drawers and lighter 

##### objects in higher ones. 

##### Avoid putting items like toys, electronics, and remotes in high places, no matter where it is. This can tempt kids 

##### to climb. 

##### Install dresser drawer stops or safety straps so your child can't pull drawers out all the way. Use the kind that 

##### attach on the outside of the drawer and side of a dresser, or magnet locks. Remember to store the magnet key in a 

##### safe place out of sight and reach of the child. 

##### Never place a TV on top of a dresser, especially in a child's room or playroom. If you have an old tube style TV and 

##### replace it with a flat screen. Recycle it rather than give it away or put it elsewhere in your home. 

##### Mount flat-screen TVs to the wall or to furniture. Use anti-tip devices for TVs that aren't wall mounted. Flat 

##### screen TVs can still injure or kill a child. Even though they seem light, they weigh as much as one or two bowling 

##### balls! You wouldn't want a bowling ball to fall on your child's head, so be sure to anchor even flat screen TV's. 

##### Check online (https://www.anchorit.gov/how-to-anchor-it/parents-and-caregivers/) for videos and articles if you 

##### need help installing anti-tip devices. Visit http://www.anchorit.gov (http://www.anchorit.gov/) to learn more about 

##### anchoring furniture and TV's. 

## Remember 

##### If your child has had furniture fall on them, be sure to take them to see their pediatrician or to the emergency room 

##### right away. Even if they seem fine, there could be internal bleeding or damage to their organs. 

##### It's also important to report tip-overs to the Consumer Product Safety Commission at http://www.saferproducts.gov, even if 

##### there was no injury, as it could prevent another child from being injured or killed by the same type of furniture.
