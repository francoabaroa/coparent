# How Active is Your Baby? 

## You might not think of the first few weeks (/English/ages-stages/baby/pages/Developmental

## Milestones-1-Month.aspx) of your baby’s life as being a time when she’s very physically active 

## (although you will probably feel that you and your spouse are being run ragged (/English/ages

## stages/baby/pages/Welcome-To-The-World-of-Parenting.aspx) in caring for her!). True, she’s 

## certainly not able to run through the park or throw a ball to another child at this age, but there are 

## still many opportunities for her to begin to develop motor skills (/English/ages

## stages/preschool/nutrition-fitness/Pages/Motor-Activity-and-Self-Play.aspx) that she can build 

## on for a very active childhood and adult life. 

## For example, have you noticed that your infant has started kicking during the second month of life? Even though this 

## movement is mostly reflective at this point, before long she’ll be able to flex and straighten her legs whenever she 

## wants to. By the time she’s 3 months old, your infant may be able to start kicking herself over from her front to her 

## back (later, by 6 months (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Movement-4-to-7-Months.aspx) of age, she’ll start rolling 

## from back to front). At about 3 to 4 months, when you hold her upright with her feet resting on the floor, she’ll push 

## down and straighten her legs as though she were standing on her own, and she’ll probably discover that she can bend 

## her knees and bounce. 

## Beginning at about 5 months of age, your infant will be able to raise her head while lying on her stomach and then 

## push up on her arms to lift her chest off the floor or bed. Rocking on her tummy, she may kick her legs and move her 

## arms as though she were swimming. Before long, your infant will be rolling over at will. At about 8 months 

## (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Movement-8-to-12-Months.aspx), she’ll be able to sit without support and catch 

## herself with her arms and hands if she starts to topple over. She’ll also pick up and move objects from one hand to the 

## other. 

## In the last few months before her first birthday (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Movement-8-to-12-Months.aspx), 

## your infant may seem like she’s in constant motion. She’ll grab (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Hand-and-Finger

## Skills.aspx) her feet and try putting them in her mouth. She may fidget and kick throughout every diaper change. 

## Between 7 and 10 months of age, she’ll begin experimenting with and then mastering the art of crawling. Next, right 

## around the time of her first birthday, she’ll take her first steps (it may happen a little earlier or a little later from one 

## child to the next, all within a normal range). 

## As your baby develops, take advantage of every opportunity to help stimulate her mind and body. From the earliest 

## weeks of life, walk around the house while holding and interacting with your baby and say aloud the names of the 

## objects that the 2 of you encounter. Before long, she’ll want to reach out, touch them, and pick them up. Also, talk to 

## your baby whenever you’re with her. Whether you’re changing her diaper, bathing her, or driving with her in the car, 

## keep the conversation going. Babies love the sound of their parents’ voices. See how she responds and how she 

## communicates with sounds by moving her arms and legs. 

## Here are some other activities that you and your baby can do together. 

## Read (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/The-Secret-to-a-Smarter-Baby.aspx) out loud to your baby. 

## Play some music (/English/healthy-living/emotional-wellness/Pages/Music-and-Mood.aspx) and gently dance 

## with her in your arms. 

## Sit and play (/English/news/Pages/Babies-and-Toddlers-Should-Learn-from-Play-Not-Screens.aspx) with her on 

## the floor. She will love interacting with you. 

## Try teaching her peekaboo and patty-cake (they can be stimulating for your baby and will help her develop 

## motor skills). 

## Hug her frequently and provide her with loving physical contact. 

## Hold your baby as often as you can. 

## Put her in the stroller (/English/safety-prevention/on-the-go/Pages/Safe-Strolling.aspx) and take her for a walk. 

## It’s a good way to expose your child to the world around her, and it’s great exercise (/English/healthy

## living/fitness/Pages/Exercise-Important-for-the-Whole-Family.aspx) for you.

## As your baby continues to grow and develop, her level of activity will increase. Make sure she has safe and soft toys 

## (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/How-to-Buy-Safe-Toys.aspx) to play with. They should be small enough so 

## she can pick them up, but large enough so she can’t put them in her mouth.
