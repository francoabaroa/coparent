# Choose Water for Healthy Hydration 

## By: Janine Rethy, MD, MPH, FAAP 

## All living things need water to survive. Along with milk, 

## plain water is the best drink choice for kids. Why? It's 

## super healthy with zero calories & no added sugar. It 

## good for the body keeps joints, bones and teeth 

## healthy, helps the blood circulate, and can help kids 

## maintain a healthy weight into adulthood. Being well 

## hydrated improves mood, memory and attention in 

## children. And it's economical – tap water is much less 

## expensive than sports drinks, sodas and juice. 

## Here are some tips on how to help your family choose 

## water. 

## How much water do children need? 

## At around 6 months, babies can be introduced to water. They only need about 4-8 ounces per day until they are a year 

## old because the rest of their liquids are coming from breastmilk or formula. 

## To stay well hydrated, children ages 1-3 years need approximately 4 cups of beverages per day, including water or milk. 

## This increases for older kids to around 5 cups for 4-8 year olds, and 7-8 cups for older children. 

## It should be noted that these amounts (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/recommended-drinks-for-young

## children-ages-0-5.aspx) vary by individual and may need to be adjusted depending on levels of activity and 

## environmental conditions like heat and humidity. 

## How to help your family choose water 

## Water doesn't have to be boring! There are plenty of ways to entice everyone in the family to drink healthy and stay 

## hydrated throughout the day. Being a good role model yourself is a great way to help make water part of your 

## children's routine and gets them in the habit of drinking water before they're thirsty. Here are a few twists to add some 

## fun: 

## Infuse water with lemons, berries, cucumber or mint for some added flavor. This is an easy way to keep the whole 

## family coming back for refills. 

## Keep fruits and vegetables that are high in water content handy and there are plenty of them. Some of the best 

## vegetables to choose from are cucumber, zucchini, iceberg lettuce, celery, and tomato. Top fruits include 

## watermelon, cantaloupe, strawberries, blueberries, and grapefruit. 

## Freeze fruit inside ice cubes. It dresses up the drinks at any table, and young children can help fill the trays. 

## Delight kids with special water bottles or cups. Whether it is a personalized sports bottle or a fancy cup with an 

## umbrella or swirly straw, adding a festive touch can go a long way. 

## Make your own popsicles with pureed fruit for an afternoon cool-down. Make it a fun family activity by using 

## small paper cups. Let your kids decorate them before filling or look for popsicle molds in fun shapes and colors. 

## Drinks to limit 

## Water and milk are all the drinks kids need. So don't believe all the hype surrounding many of the other drinks 

## marketed to kids. These usually contain way more sugar than children need in a day and can contribute to poor 

## health. Here's what to avoid: 


### Sugary drinks : Make a rule: no sugar-sweetened beverages (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/How-to

### Reduce-Added-Sugar-in-Your-Childs-Diet.aspx) for your children who are less than 2 years of age. And try to 

### limit them for your older children as much as possible. This includes sports drinks, juice cocktails, sodas, 

### lemonade, and sweetened water. These drinks discourage a habit of drinking plain water, and can add extra 

### “empty calories" to the diet. They can also leave your kids less hungry for the nutritious foods they really need. 

### Added sugars can lead to excess weight gain, dental cavities, diabetes, and more. 

### Juice : Even 100% juice (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Fruit-Juice-and-Your-Childs-Diet.aspx) should 

### be strictly limited. While it can contain some vitamins, these drinks are high in sugar and calories and low in the 

### healthy fiber found in whole fruit. Because of its sweet taste, once children are offered juice, it can be difficult to 

### get them to drink plain water. Keep these amounts in mind: 

### Children less than a year should not drink any juice at all. 

### Children 1-3 years of age should have no more than 4 oz per day. 

### For older children, juice is only recommended if whole fruits are not available. Children ages 4–6 years, no 

### more than 4–6 oz per day, and for children ages 7–18, no more than 8 oz per day. 

### Flavored milk : Even though you get the benefits of the calcium and vitamins found in milk, flavored milk can be 

### much higher in sugar. These added sugars should be avoided to discourage a preference for sweet flavors, which 

### can make it difficult to have success when offering regular milk. 

### Steviaor artificially-sweetened drinks : Because health risks for children from stevia and artificial 

### sweeteners (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Sweeteners-and-Sugar-Substitutes.aspx) are not well 

### understood, it is best to avoid these drinks. Instead, make water readily available to encourage healthy hydration. 

## Signs of dehydration 

### Even with the best habits and intentions, trouble can arise. It is important to know the signs of dehydration 

### (/English/health-issues/injuries-emergencies/Pages/dehydration.aspx) so you can address them quickly. 

### Infants 0-6 months should only be drinking breast milk or formula. Additional water is not recommended at this age. 

### Around 6 months, complementary foods and small amounts of water can be added. If you are worried that your infant 

### is not getting enough to drink, call your pediatrician immediately. The most noticeable symptoms of dehydration in 

### this age are: 

### Fewer wet diapers, with the typical range being from 6 to 8 

### Overly sleepy 

### Sunken soft spot (fontanelle) on the baby's head 

### No tears when crying 

### As children get older, they are better able to tell you how they are feeling. However, it is still necessary to keep an eye 

### on them since children at play often have a hard time stopping. Symptoms in older children include: 

### Dry lips or sticky mouth 

### Less urination or dark-colored urine remember urine should be very light yellow, almost clear 

### Sleepy and irritable 

### Flushed skin 

### In teens, dehydration is a big risk especially if they do high-intensity workouts or heavy team practices. Most common 

### signs for this age group are: 

### Dry lips or mouth 

### Lightheadedness 

### Cramps 

### Thirst 

### Dark or less urine

### Headache 

### Rapid pulse 

### Flushed skin 

### Feeling excessively hot or cold 

## Staying hydrated during sports, exercise or heat 

### Being active (/English/healthy

### living/fitness/Pages/Making-Fitness-a-Way-of-Life.aspx) is 

### an important lifestyle choice for every member of the 

### family. But during sports or other physical activities, your 

### child may need additional water to prevent dehydration. For 

### example, when taking part in sports, make sure your child 

### drinks water before, during and after practices or games. 

### When exercising vigorously or sweating, children from 9-12 

### years of age generally need to drink about 3–8 ounces of 

### water every 20 minutes to stay hydrated. Teens need to 

### drink about 34–50 ounces per hour. It is helpful to stay well 

### hydrated in the days and hours before activity begins. 

### While playing at the park may not bring the same level of intensity, if your child is sweating, make sure they are 

### adequately replacing fluids. 

### If vigorous exercise extends beyond 1 hour in a day or your child is sweating a lot, electrolyte-supplemented beverages 

### may be necessary. 

## Heat-related illnesses 

### If your children do become dehydrated or overwhelmed in the heat, they are at risk for heat exhaustion and heat 

### stroke (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/Protecting-Children-from-Extreme-Heat-Information-for

### Parents.aspx). Here's how you can tell the difference. 

### Heat exhaustion occurs from excessive sweating, causing dehydration and for the core body temperature to 

### rise. If this happens, move your child out of sunlight to a cool place, rehydrate with cool water, wear light, cool 

### clothes and use cold towels or ice packs to lower your child's body temperature. To be safe, if your child's 

### symptoms are concerning or last more than an hour, talk with your pediatrician. 

### Heat stroke. Sometimes called sun stroke, heat stroke is the most serious. It is when the body overheats to a 

### point where it begins to shut down. If your child is confused or unresponsive, has a rapid pulse (/English/health

### issues/conditions/heart/Pages/Irregular-Heartbeat

### Arrhythmia.aspx#%3a~%3atext=To%20check%20your%20child%27s%20pulse%2cand%20then%20multiply%20b 

### y%204.), or a temperature (/English/health-issues/conditions/fever/Pages/How-to-Take-a-Childs

### Temperature.aspx) over 103 degrees, immediate medical treatment is needed. 

## When to seek medical assistance 

### If you have any concerns about dehydration or a heat-related illness, don't hesitate to call your pediatrician. If your 

### child becomes extremely lethargic or unresponsive, vomits, stops sweating, or complains of severe abdominal pain, 

### head to your local emergency room or call 911 (/English/health-issues/injuries-emergencies/Pages/Calling-911

### How-and-When-to-Call-for-Help.aspx). While these cases are less common, getting help quickly can make all the 

### difference. 

## Remember 

### Staying properly hydrated keeps the body and mind running efficiently and feeling strong. Serve water with meals 

### and snacks, and take those extra few minutes to pack the water bottles before your family heads out the door. Helping 

### your children choose water first, and modeling this choice yourself, builds healthy habits that will pay dividends for a 

### lifetime!
