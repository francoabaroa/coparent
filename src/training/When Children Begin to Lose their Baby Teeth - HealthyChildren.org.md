# When Children Begin to Lose their Baby Teeth 

## When will my child start losing his baby teeth? How can 

## I be sure his adult teeth stay healthy? 

## Erupting permanent teeth cause the roots of baby teeth to be reabsorbed so that by the time they 

## are loose there is little holding them in place besides a small amount of tissue. Most children lose 

## their baby teeth in this order: 

## Baby teeth ordinarily are shed first at about age 6 when the incisors, the middle teeth in 

## front, become loose. 

## Molars, in the back, are usually shed between ages 10 and 12, and are replaced with permanent teeth by about age 

## 13. 

## Children usually wiggle their teeth loose with their tongues or fingers, eager to hide them under their pillow for the 

## "tooth fairy." If your child wants you to pull out the already loose tooth, grasp it firmly with a piece of tissue or gauze 

## and remove it with a quick twist. Occasionally, if a primary tooth is not loosening sufficiently on its own, your child's 

## dentist may suggest extracting it. 

## If your child loses his baby teeth by decay or accident too early, his permanent teeth can erupt prematurely and come 

## in crooked because of limited space. According to orthodontists, 30 percent of their cases have their origins in the 

## premature loss of baby teeth. 

## Brushing and flossing 

## Your child may need some help brushing until he is between ages 7 and 10. Even if his intentions are good, he may not 

## have the dexterity to clean his teeth well. Ideally, the teeth should be brushed within five minutes to 10 minutes after 

## eating. Also, for long-term dental health, your child needs to care for his gums as well; he should be taught to floss 

## regularly, preferably once a day, in order to help prevent gum (or periodontal) disease in adulthood. 

## A tartar-control toothpaste can help keep plaque from adhering to your child's teeth. Also, fluoride in the toothpaste 

## can strengthen the exposed outer enamel of the youngster's teeth and help prevent cavities. Fluoride also has been 

## added to the water supply in many cities. If your own tap water has less than the recommended levels of this nutrient, 

## your pediatrician may suggest that you add fluoride to your child's diet beginning at age 6 months, often as part of a 

## vitamin supplement. Fluoride treatment should continue until age 16. Ask your doctor or dentist for guidance. 

## Dental checkups 

## Make sure your youngster has dental checkups twice a year for cleaning, as well as for X-rays as recommended by 

## your dentist. Parents may choose to utilize a pedodontist, a dentist with special interest and expertise in children's 

## dentistry. Regular preventive appointments will significantly decrease your child's chances of ever having to undergo 

## major dental treatment. Also, contact your dentist whenever your child complains of a toothache. This pain could be a 

## sign of a decayed tooth. Until the dentist can see your child, treat the pain with acetaminophen by mouth. 

## Preventing cavities 

## Your dentist may also suggest placing sealants on your child's molars. These thin plastic coatings prevent plaque from 

## accumulating and becoming trapped in the pits and fissures of the teeth. They are appropriate for all rear teeth that 

## have grooves in them, and because they are extremely successful in preventing cavities, they are cost-effective too. 

## Sealants may need to be reapplied during adolescence. With a combination of sealants and fluoride treatment, the 

## incidence of cavities can be reduced by 90 percent. 

## Diet can also play a role in healthy teeth. In particular, minimize your child's contact with high-sugar and sticky sweets 

## and other carbohydrates. Cut back on snacking on sweets between meals, when these foods are more likely to linger 

## in the mouth without brushing.
