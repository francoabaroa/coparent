# How Your Newborn Behaves 

## Lying in your arms or in the crib beside you, your 

## newborn makes a tight little bundle. Just as they did in 

## the womb, they’ll keep their arms and legs bent up 

## close to their body and his fingers tightly clenched, 

## although you should be able to gently straighten them. 

## Their feet will naturally curve inward. It may take 

## several weeks for their body to unfold from this 

## preferred fetal position. 

## Making & hearing sounds 

## You’ll have to wait even longer for him to make the 

## cooing or babbling sounds we think of as "baby talk." 

## However, from the beginning they’ll be very noisy. Besides crying when something is wrong, your newborn will have a 

## wide variety of grunts, squeaks, sighs, sneezes, and hiccups. (You may even remember the hiccups from pregnancy!) 

## Many of these sounds, just like their sudden movements, are reactions to disturbances around them; a shrill sound or 

## a strong odor may be all it takes to make them jump or cry. 

## These reactions, as well as more subtle ones, are signs of how your baby’s senses are functioning at birth. After all 

## those months in the womb, they’ll quickly recognize their mother’s voice (and possibly their partner’s, as well). If you 

## play soothing music, they may become quiet as they listen (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Hearing-and-Making

## Sounds.aspx) or move gently in time with it. 

## Smell, taste & vision 

## By using smell (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Newborn-Smell-and-Touch.aspx) and taste, your newborn is able to 

## distinguish breast milk (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/default.aspx) from any other liquid. Breast 

## milk is naturally sweet and will appeal to a baby's sweet tooth. 

## Your baby’s vision (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Babys-Vision-Development.aspx)will be best within an 8to 12

## inch (20.3 to 30.5 cm) range, which means they can see your face perfectly as you hold and feed them. When you are 

## farther away, their eyes may wander, giving a cross-eyed appearance. Don't worry about this during the first couple of 

## months. Between two and three months of age, your newborn's eye muscles will mature, their vision will improve, and 

## both eyes will stay focused on the same thing more of the time. If this does not, bring it to the attention of your baby’s 

## pediatrician. 

## While able to tell light from dark at birth, your newborn ill not yet see the full range of colors. Young infants who are 

## shown a pattern of black and white or sharply contrasting colors may study them with interest. However, they are not 

## likely to respond at all when shown a picture with lots of closely related colors. 

## Sense of touch 

## Perhaps the newborn's most important sense is touch. After months of being in the womb, your baby is now exposed 

## to all sorts of new sensations some harsh, some wonderfully comforting. While they may cringe at a sudden gust of 

## cold air, they'll love the feel of a soft blanket and the warmth of your arms around them. 

## Holding your baby gives them as much pleasure as it does you. It will give them a sense of security and comfort, and 

## tell them they are loved. Research shows that close emotional bonding actually will promote his growth and 

## development.
