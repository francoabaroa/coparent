# Positive Reinforcement Through Rewards 

## Some children need more than recognition and praise. Rewards can be effective in middle childhood, especially once 

## you have clearly defined the specific, positive behavior goals you expect. Here are some effective strategies: 

## Make or devise a chart that specifies the desired behavior, as well as the time of day or the situation in which it 

## should be demonstrated. The calendar should cover an entire week or, for some behavior, a longer period. It 

## should allow the activity or goal to be rated each day. Decide how many points an incidence of positive behavior 

## will earn. In a summary column, total up the points. (Tokens, such as paper stars pasted on the calendar, tend to 

## work better for early school-age children; points and contract systems work better for older children.) Small 

## rewards may be given for a predetermined amount of points at the end of each day or week, with larger rewards 

## reserved for a longer period of time or a greater number of points. Keep this behavior chart in a conspicuous 

## place so it can serve as a source of positive reinforcement and pride. 

## Make a list of the rewards your child will receive for a partic ular number of points. Rewards should be 

## meaningful to your child, and she should participate actively in their selection. Be very clear about how many 

## points or days or weeks of changed behavior it takes to earn a reward. 

## It is important to keep close daily track of your child's progress. Keep her enthusiasm level high by reinforcing 

## behavior as frequently as possible. 

## Keep in mind that the chart should be used as a measure of success. Avoid penalties and demerits that are 

## humiliating, or that discourage your child from even trying. Use other forms of mild punishment, such as 

## timeouts. 

## Gradually, this program can be phased out as children internalize their behavior. At that time, children usually lose 

## interest or forget to ask for their points.
