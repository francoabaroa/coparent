# Why to Avoid TV for Infants & Toddlers 

## By: David L. Hill, MD, FAAP 

## Parents are often shocked when I tell them that pediatricians think 

## it's a bad idea for children to watch TV or use mobile apps before 

## age 18 months, because most toddlers already have. Surveys tell us 

## that 92.2% of 1-year-olds have already used a mobile device, some 

## starting as young as age 4 months. 

## Early Brain Development 

## I hear a lot of parents say, "But my baby likes it!" Infants may stare at 

## the bright colors and motion on a screen, but their brains are 

## incapable of making sense or meaning out of all those bizarre 

## pictures. 

## It takes around 18 months for a baby's brain (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/How-Do-Infants-Learn.aspx) to 

## develop to the point where the symbols on a screen come to represent their equivalents in the real world. 

## What infants and toddlers need most to learn is interaction with the people around them. That doesn't mean that they 

## shouldn't video-chat with a distant grandparent or a deployed parent, but when it comes to day-to-day learning they 

## need to touch things, shake them, throw them, and most of all to see the faces and hear the voices of those they love 

## the most. Apps can teach toddlers to tap and swipe at a screen, but studies tell us that these skills don't translate into 

## real-world learning. See Healthy Digital Media Use Habits for Babies, Toddlers & Preschoolers (/English/family

## life/Media/Pages/healthy-digital-media-use-habits-for-babies-toddlers-preschoolers.aspx). 

## Where's the Harm? 

## So sure, babies and toddlers don't get anything out of watching TV, but if they seem to like it, where's the harm? If a 

## little TV is what it takes for you to get dinner on the table, isn't it better for them than, say, starving? Yes, watching TV is 

## better than starving, but it's worse than not watching TV. Good evidence suggests that screen viewing before age 18 

## months has lasting negative effects on children's language development (/English/ages

## stages/toddler/Pages/Language-Delay.aspx), reading skills, and short term memory. It also contributes to problems 

## with sleep (/English/healthy-living/sleep/Pages/Healthy-Sleep-Habits-How-Many-Hours-Does-Your-Child

## Need.aspx) and attention. 

## If "you are what you eat," then the brain is what it experiences, and video entertainment is like mental junk food 

## for babies and toddlers. 

## The problem lies not only with what toddlers are doing while they're watching TV; it's what they aren't doing. 

## Specifically, children are programmed to learn from interacting with other people. The dance of facial expressions, 

## tone of voice, and body language between a toddler and parent is not only beautiful, it's so complex that researchers 

## have to record these interactions on video and slow them down just to see everything that's going on. Whenever one 

## party in this dance, child or parent, is watching TV, the exchange comes to a halt. 

## A toddler learns a lot more from banging pans on the floor while you cook dinner than he does from watching a 

## screen for the same amount of time, because every now and then the two of you look at each other. 

## Just having the TV on in the background, even if "no one is watching it," is enough to delay language development. 

## Normally a parent speaks about 940 words per hour when a toddler is around. With the television on, that number 

## falls by 770! Fewer words means less learning. 

## Toddlers are also learning to pay attention for prolonged periods, and toddlers who watch more TV are more likely to 

## have problems paying attention at age 7. Video programming is constantly changing, constantly interesting, and 

## almost never forces a child to deal with anything more tedious than an infomercial.

#### After age 2 things change, at least somewhat. During the preschool years some children do learn some skills from 

#### educational TV. Well-designed shows can teach kids literacy, math, science, problem-solving, and prosocial behavior. 

### Children get more out of interactive programs like Dora the Explorer and Sesame Street when they answer the 

#### characters' questions. Educational TV makes the biggest difference for children whose homes are the least 

#### intellectually stimulating. 

## What You Can Do: 

#### Naturally, children learn more when they watch TV or use apps with a parent. Content matters, a lot. All programs 

#### educate kids about something, but stick with ones that are designed to teach children stuff they should actually know 

#### like language and math. 

#### Regardless of content, cap your child's electronic entertainment time at 1 hour a day from age 18 months to age 

#### five. 

#### Remember, too, TV is still TV whether you actually watch it on a TV screen or on a mobile phone or computer.
