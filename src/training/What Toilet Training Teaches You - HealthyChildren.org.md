# What Toilet Training Teaches You 

## If you are like most parents, you are delighted to see your child successfully concluding the 

## toilet-training process. The days of loading the grocery cart with diapers are behind you (at least 

## with this child), and accidents have dwindled to a manageable few. But the completion of toilet 

## training signifies much more than liberation from diapers. By learning to control this bodily 

## function, your child has moved significantly closer toward self-mastery—every young child’s 

## goal. 

## Responding to your wish for him to use the toilet “like a big boy” and practicing this new skill and 

## succeeding again and again have given him a wonderful new sense of competence and even 

## independence. This feeling that he can successfully meet a challenge will add to his confidence in other areas of his 

## life, including social and academic pursuits. Even in the face of occasional accidents, then, it is important to recognize 

## the level of accomplishment your toilet-trained child has reached. 

## What Will You Learn About Yourself? 

## One of the fascinations of parenthood is that many of our own long-unexamined assumptions and buried emotions 

## surface as we interact with our children. When your child was first born, you may have been surprised at how you 

## responded to each new experience. You may have been awed or frightened by the act of childbirth, enchanted or 

## apprehensive about breastfeeding, confident or anxious the first time you held your child. 

## Toilet training also evokes a wide range of feelings, many of which may have been deeply buried in the unconscious 

## until now—competitiveness, anxiety, anger, neediness, ambition, and a host of other emotions. Reasonable or not, such 

## feelings can be difficult to control. As you look back on your experience toilet-training your child, think about your 

## emotional responses—the positive feelings as well as the ones you now regret. Why do you think your emotions were 

## stirred by these specific occasions? What did you do when you felt these ways? Did you find ways to express your 

## emotions that did not damage your child’s self-esteem and led to positive solutions? What did you learn about 

## yourself through these interactions that you can generalize to other parenting situations? 

## Toilet training is a valuable task that every parent must undertake. But its greater value lies in its power to teach 

## parents more about their children, themselves, and their lives together as a family. Ideally, in the years to come you 

## will be able to draw on lessons learned during this task to communicate effectively, promote desirable behavior, 

## approach new challenges in positive ways, and toilet-train future children with greater ease. 

## What Will You Learn About Your Child? 

## The toilet training process not only offers you new insights into your own emotions, attitudes, and parenting 

## approach, but also allows you a fascinating look at your child’s personality and learning style. Once toilet training is 

## more or less completed, think back on your child’s experiences. Which parts of the process were easy for him and 

## which were more difficult? Did he have a hard time sitting still on the potty for more than thirty seconds or so? Did he 

## become so involved with other activities that he frequently forgot to go? Did he tend to mimic whatever child he was 

## with at any given time—using the potty if the other child did but having an accident if the other child was still in 

## diapers? Which training techniques worked best—talking a great deal with him about potty use or simply placing him 

## on the potty, sticking to a regular schedule, or just letting him sense when he needed to go? Did he appreciate your 

## reminders to go to the bathroom or did he perceive them as controlling and resist? Did he respond better to hugs and 

## kisses, words of praise, stars on a chart, or promises of fun activities if he stayed dry through the day or the week? 

## An observant parent will notice how much more effective positive reinforcement is with children than criticism or 

## punishment. The desire to please a parent—and to be praised, loved, and rewarded—is extremely powerful in most 

## young children. Toilet training is one of the best times to witness and appreciate this motivation in your child. As your 

## child moves on to kindergarten and elementary school, your continued positive interest and rewards for progress will 

## keep his desire to please alive, helping him achieve academic, social, and personal success.

## What Will You Learn About Your Family? 

### Some of the more frequent insights you will experience during the toilet training process have to do with the ways in 

### which your family works together. Chances are you notice over the six months or longer that toilet training generally 

### takes that you (or your partner) take on the role of family disciplinarian while your partner (or you) prefers a more 

### permissive approach. (All references in this section to a partner can be applied to any other adult involved in raising 

### your child.) Or you may notice that your child generally goes to one parent when she has an accident and the other 

### when she announces her success. You and your partner may also learn to recognize the signs indicating when one of 

### you reaches his or her limit, requiring quick intervention from the other. Finally, you may notice that one of you may 

### be more inclined to “do” for your child, while the other is more likely to help her to be as independent as possible—a 

### pattern that may continue for years. 

### Though you will find that many of these created patterns will continue throughout childhood, others will change 

### many times over the years: Your child may turn to one parent more than the other for a few years, then switch 

### parents; she may imitate one of you at one stage of her life, the other at another stage, and then switch back again; she 

### may prefer one of you as her confidant, the other as her playmate. The main thing to remember is that she will have 

### separate relationships with both of her parents, and this is all part of growing up and becoming herself. 

### However, you can use what you observe about your patterns as a family to make whatever changes you think are 

### necessary. Perhaps you will find that the two of you tend to “gang up” on your child when she makes a mistake, 

### overwhelming her rather than allowing her room to understand and correct her mistake. Or you may notice that 

### when you and your partner disagree over your approach to a parenting problem, you each tend to follow your own 

### course, undermining the other’s efforts instead of agreeing on a viable compromise. Reserve some time to discuss 

### these issues alone with your partner or together with your child’s pediatrician. You may even talk with your child on a 

### simple level about which parenting techniques lead her to feel better or worse. 

## Enjoying Your Self-Sufficient Child 

### When it comes time for your toilet-trained child to say goodbye to toddlerhood and move on, you can congratulate 

### yourself on the completion of a major parenting challenge. Your child has become more confident and independent 

### as a result of your efforts to help him achieve this developmental milestone, and his pride in his ability to master a new 

### skill will support his further development. The simple fact that he has experienced the pleasure of achieving a goal 

### will make later success more likely. In the years to come, accidents will happen now and then. What’s important is 

### that your child and your family have accomplished something together and you are now better prepared to meet the 

### challenges that lie ahead.
