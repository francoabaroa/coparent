# Your Child’s First Phone: Are They Ready? 

## By: Jenny Radesky, MD, FAAP 

## Deciding when to give your child their first phone can 

## be a source of anxiety. Smartphones, in particular, offer 

## a portal to the internet, apps and social media. You may 

## not feel your child is ready for that much access to the 

## digital world. Yet, you may want to get your child a 

## phone for the basics: having a way to contact you when 

## they're traveling between school, after-school activities 

## or different households. 

## More connected, but more 

## distracted? 

## During the COVID-19 pandemic, many families have seen the positives of letting their children use internet

## connected devices. For many kids, it has meant being able to talk and play with friends virtually during school closings 

## and isolation at home. But the pandemic also showcased the downsides of more time online. Many children have 

## stumbled upon age-inappropriate videos, for example, or had creepy encounters with people online. Others are unable 

## to put the device down when it's time to do something else. 

## How are cell phones different than other devices? 

## All of this raises the question: Lots of kids have access to tablets and computers, so how are phones different? Well, a 

## big reason is that mobile phones are just that— mobile. Children can carry them everywhere. Phones are more likely 

## to be right next to your child—on their bedside table, at the dinner table, on car rides or other many spaces other 

## devices don't typically go. Because of this, they may interrupt or push out other important activities. These may 

## include face-to-face conversation, homework, sports practice or sleep, to name a few. 

## Here are some things to ask and consider as you and your child 

## discuss getting a first phone: 

## 1. Has your child thought through how they would want to use the phone? It's natural for kids and teens to want 

## a phone because "everyone else has one." However, they may not be ready for problems that can come with 

## having a phone. Some teens have actually said they regret getting a smartphone early. These kids didn't realize 

## they would have so many new distractions or social drama in their lives. 

## Talk with your child about other options—like getting a flip phone or watch that allows communication without 

## all the digital baggage. Options like these may be a better fit at younger ages. 

## 2. What are your child's unique strengths and challenges that might make having a phone more difficult? 

## Does your child have a strong sense of responsibility and impulse control, or do they tend to act before thinking? 

## Do they need your help with making good decisions, or do you trust their judgment when they are unsupervised? 

## This becomes important to consider once they have access to the internet, texting and social media apps and can 

## easily say or post things they may regret. 

## 3. How would you know your child is being a responsible phone user? Talk with your child about online safety 

## and good digital citizenship. Decide on some benchmarks that would show that they are being safe and kind 

## while using their new technology. (For example, did they get in any online arguments this week? Did they check 

## their phone during class?) You may be able to get some idea about this based on your child's experience during 

## virtual learning to help guide your conversation. (Did your child get really distracted with video games or 

## websites during Zoom classes? Could they resist that temptation?) 


### 4. What are the other ways they can connect with friends? Social connection is the biggest driver for having a 

### phone in the tween and teen years. Interacting with friends is crucial tant as your child develops a sense of self 

### and community. However, if you don't think your child is ready for a smartphone, there are other ways to help 

### them connect with friends. 

### In addition to making sure they have in-person social opportunities like clubs or sports, you could enable video 

### chat and text messaging on an iPad or tablet, for example. Or, you could allow video gaming with friends on a 

### shared server or safe multiplayer game with an "invitation only" privacy setting. 

### 5. Do you have a regular way to check in with them about how life is going (including their digital life)? 

### When kids get a smartphone, they have easier access to the world of information on the internet, apps, and social 

### media. Because the digital world isn't always designed with young users in mind, though, your child or teen 

### needs you to act as a mentor. In this role, you can help them have positive experiences online and unpack the 

### negative experiences. 

### If you don't have a regular time when you can talk with your child, like during car rides or meal times, try making 

### a new routine. You might set aside a night each week when you cook a meal together, for example, or block out 

### time for a shared workout. 

### It's also important to keep informed about what's going on with digital media. Have your child show you what 

### games (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/Video-Games-Set-Your-Own-Ratings-System.aspx)or apps they like, or 

### read up (https://www.commonsensemedia.org/app-reviews) on them when you have a minute. 

## Continue the conversation 

### If you and your child decide that they are not ready for a phone, that's OK too. This can be an ongoing conversation 

### about your child's relationship with technology. You can continue to explore what kind of non-smartphone tech 

### products are available that meet their social needs, as well, along with other considerations. 

### If you do decide to get a phone for your child, make the effort to know what kinds of features there are to support safe 

### and positive media use. These may include parental controls, settings, filters, timers and other digital wellness tools 

### are available on devices and apps. Set these up together with your child, and explain the reasons behind the limits and 

### controls you choose for your child's cell phone. 

### Treat getting a phone like an experiment. As your child shows more responsibility, they could gain more 

### independence and fewer controls. Keep a mentorship mindset: Check out new apps or platforms together, compare 

### notes, and decide together what is working and what's not. 

### Finally, create a family media use plan and model health phone habits. Remember that kids learn as much from 

### watching us as they do from our well-intended lectures! If you look at your phone while driving or during meals, they 

### are likely to do the same. If you can try to balance your media use with screen-free activities, they will find it easier to 

### do the same.
