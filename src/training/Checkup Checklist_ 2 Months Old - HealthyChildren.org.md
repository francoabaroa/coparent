# Checkup Checklist: 2 Months Old 

Can you believe it? Your baby is almost 2 months old and its time for another visit to the pediatrician. This appointment may cause some tears, so have your tissues ready. In addition to the usual physical exam, your baby may also get a few shots this time.

 Hepatitis B vaccine (/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Hepatitis-B-Vaccine-What-ParentsNeed-to-Know.aspx) (HBV) 

 Rotavirus vaccine (/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Rotavirus-Vaccine-What-You-Need-toKnow.aspx)

##### It may have you thinking, "Is it really safe to give my baby that many shots at once?" The answer is yes (/English/safety

prevention/immunizations/Pages/Multiple-Vaccinations-at-One-Time.aspx). And luckily, your pediatrician can combine some shots so there's less pricking and hopefully less crying. See "Multiple Vaccinations at One Time (/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Multiple-Vaccinations-at-One-Time.aspx)."
