# Serious Illnesses and Breastfeeding 

## For some new mothers, concerns about breastfeeding 

## revolve less around their babies' physical condition 

## than their own. Since some infectious diseases can be 

## passed on to the baby through human milk, you will 

## certainly want to discuss your medical history with 

## your doctor and your baby's pediatrician. 

## HIV 

## The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers 

## for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advise 

## mothers in the United States who are infected with HIV 

## not to breastfeed, since the virus may be passed in the 

## breast milk to their infant. They may, however, feed their babies pasteurized donor human milk if available. 

## Hepatitis B 

## Hepatitis B virus has been detected in human milk, but breastfeeding has not been shown to increase the risk of 

## infection to the baby. If you have Hepatitis B infection, there is no need to delay starting breastfeeding until your 

## infant is immunized against hepatitis B. 

## Hepatitis C 

## Mothers who have can safely breastfeed. Though an infant can be infected with hepatitis C during pregnancy or 

## delivery, breastfed infants do not have higher rates of hepatitis C than formula-fed infants. Breastfeeding may even 

## help prevent the spread of hepatitis C from mother to the baby, by providing antibodies passed to the baby through the 

## breast milk. If you are infected with hepatitis C and have cracked or bleeding nipples, however, you may want to hold 

## off on breastfeeding (and discard pumped milk) until the nipple heals. 

## Tuberculosis 

## If you have tuberculosis (TB), you may breastfeed if you are currently taking medication. Mothers with untreated TB 

## at the time of delivery should not breastfeed or be in direct contact with their newborn until they have started 

## appropriate drug treatment and they are no longer infectious. 

## In most cases, you can safely breastfeed after you have been taking antibiotics for about two weeks and have been told 

## by your doctor that you are no longer infectious. You should begin pumping soon after delivery, and your pumped 

## milk may be fed to your infant by your partner, a nurse, or another caregiver until you can breastfeed directly. If you 

## have had a positive TB skin test but a normal chest X-ray, talk to your doctor to see if you need to be treated with any 

## medication, but you can breastfeed in this case. 

## Other infections 

## Other types of infections need to be evaluated by your obstetrician, pediatrician, or family physician, but few will 

## prevent breastfeeding. This is true even when the infection or inflammation involves the breast itself—as in the case 

## of mastitis, an infection of a section of the breast. This condition is typically treated with antibiotics, frequent 

## If you are infected with hepatitis B, your baby should receive the vaccination for hepatitis B—along with hepatitis B 

## immune globulin (HBIG)—as soon as possible after birth. Giving these two injections soon after delivery is highly 

## effective in preventing the spread of hepatitis B from mother to infant. In fact, the hepatitis B vaccine is 

## recommended for all babies, whether their mother is infected with hepatitis B or not.

### breastfeeding, and/or expression of milk with a pump, adequate fluids, pain medication, and rest. 

## Cancer 

### If you have been diagnosed with breast cancer in the past and have been treated for it, you may be concerned about 

### the effects of breastfeeding on you and your baby. Previous breast cancer does not mean that you cannot breastfeed 

### your baby. If you have had a mastectomy, you can feed from the remaining breast. If you have had a tumor removed 

### from your breast or radiation treatments, you can still try feeding from that breast. You may find that your milk 

### production is less, however. Always discuss your breastfeeding options with your physician. 

## Breast surgery 

### In the past, there have been concerns about the safety of breastfeeding after breast enlargement with breast implants. 

### But there is no evidence that silicone breast implants cause any harm to the baby, and the newer saline (saltwater

### filled) implant devices do not cause any problems, either. In most cases, plastic surgery to enlarge the breasts should 

### not interfere significantly with your ability to breastfeed provided the nipples have not been moved and no milk ducts 

### have been cut. 

### In certain cases of breast enlargement, the women had underdeveloped breast tissue, which was the reason for the 

### procedure. In these cases, the relative lack of breast gland tissue may interfere with the production of enough breast 

### milk. With any previous breast surgery, the baby will need to be monitored carefully to make sure that they are 

### getting enough milk. 

### Surgery to reduce the size of breasts (breast reduction) is more likely to interfere with breastfeeding. This is 

### especially the case if the nipples were repositioned during the surgery—resulting in the total cutting of milk ducts or 

### nerves. Some women who have had this type of breast surgery are able to breastfeed, though. 

### With more recent surgical procedures, and with surgeons paying attention to the woman's desire to breastfeed in the 

### future, it is more likely that breastfeeding, or at least partial breastfeeding, will be successful. Any woman who has had 

### reduction surgery on her breasts, however, should be sure that her baby's weight gain and feeding are closely 

### supervised by her infant's healthcare provider in the days and weeks after birth. 

### If you have had any surgical procedure on your breast, even a biopsy, make sure that your baby's doctor knows this. By 

### all means begin breastfeeding, making sure that your pediatrician or family physician closely monitors your infant to 

### be certain that they are getting enough breast milk.
