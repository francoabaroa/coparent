# First Aid Guide for Parents & Caregivers 

## General Tips 

## Know how to get help. 

## Make sure the area is safe for you and the child. 

## When possible, personal protective equipment (such as 

## gloves) should be used. 

## Position the child appropriately if her airway needs to be 

## opened or CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) is needed. 

## DO NOT MOVE A CHILD WHO MAY HAVE A NECK OR BACK 

## INJURY (from a fall, motor vehicle crash, or other injury or 

## if the child says his neck or back hurts) unless he is in danger. 

## Look for anything (such as emergency medical identification jewelry or paperwork) that may give you 

## information about health problems. 

## Stings, Bites & Allergies 

## Stinging Insects: Remove the stinger as soon as possible with a scraping motion using a firm item (such as the 

## edge of a credit card). Put a cold compress on the bite to relieve the pain. If trouble breathing; fainting; swelling of 

## lips, face, or throat; or hives over the entire body occurs, call 911 or your local emergency number right away. For 

## hives in a small area, nausea, or vomiting, call the pediatrician. For spider bites, call the pediatrician or Poison 

## Help (1-800-222-1222). Have the pediatrician check any bites that become red, warm, swollen, or painful. 

## Animal or Human Bites: Wash the wound well with soap and water. Call the pediatrician. The child may need a 

## tetanus or rabies shot or antibiotics. 

## Ticks: Use tweezers or your fingers to grasp as close as possible to the head of the tick and briskly pull the tick 

## away from where it is attached. Call the pediatrician if the child develops symptoms such as a rash or fever. 

## Snake Bites: Take the child to an emergency department if you are unsure of the type of snake or if you are 

## concerned that the snake may be poisonous. Keep the child at rest. Do not apply ice. Loosely splint the injured 

## area and keep it at rest, positioned at or slightly below the level of the heart. Identify the snake if you can do so 

## safely. If you are not able to identify the snake but are able to kill it safely, take it with you to the emergency 

## department for identification. 

## Allergy: Swelling, problems breathing, and paleness may be signs of severe allergy. Call 911 or your local 

## emergency number right away. Some people may have emergency medicine for these times. If possible, ask 

## about emergency medicine they may have and help them administer it if necessary. 

## Fever 

## Fever in children is usually caused by infection. It also can be caused by chemicals, poisons, medicines, an 

## environment that is too hot, or an extreme level of overactivity. 

## Take the child's temperature to see if he has a fever. Most pediatricians consider any thermometer reading 100.4°F 

## (38°C) or higher as a fever. However, the way the child looks and acts is more important than how high the child's 

## temperature is. 

## Call the pediatrician right away if the child has a fever and: 

## Appears very ill, is unusually drowsy, or is very fussy 

## Has other symptoms such as a stiff neck, a severe headache, severe sore throat, severe ear pain, an unexplained 

## rash, repeated vomiting or diarrhea, or difficulty breathing 

## Has a condition causing immune suppression (such as sickle cell disease, cancer, or chronic steroid use) 

## Has had a first seizure but is no longer seizing 

## Is younger than 3 months (12 weeks) and has a temperature of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher 

## Has been in a very hot place, such as an overheated car 


#### To make the child more comfortable, dress him in light clothing, give him cool liquids to drink, and keep him calm. 

#### The pediatrician may recommend fever medicines. Do NOT use aspirin to treat a child's fever. Aspirin has been linked 

#### with Reye syndrome, a serious disease that affects the liver and brain. 

## Skin Wounds 

#### Make sure the child is up to date for tetanus vaccination. Any open wound may need a tetanus booster even when the 

#### child is currently immunized. If the child has an open wound, ask the pediatrician if the child needs a tetanus booster. 

#### Bruises: Apply cool compresses. Call the pediatrician if the child has a crush injury, large bruises, continued 

#### pain, or swelling. The pediatrician may recommend acetaminophen for pain. 

#### Cuts: Rinse small cuts with water until clean. Use direct pressure with a clean cloth to stop bleeding and hold in 

#### place for 1 to 2 minutes. If the cut is not deep, apply an antibiotic ointment; then cover the cut with a clean 

#### bandage. Call the pediatrician or seek emergency care for large or deep cuts, or if the wound is wide open. For 

#### major bleeding, call for help (911 or your local emergency number). Continue direct pressure with a clean cloth 

#### until help arrives. 

#### Scrapes: Rinse with clean, running tap water for at least 5 minutes to remove dirt and germs. Do not use 

#### detergents, alcohol, or peroxide. Apply an antibiotic ointment and a bandage that will not stick to the wound. 

#### Splinters: Remove small splinters with tweezers; then wash until clean. If you cannot remove the splinter 

#### completely, call the pediatrician. 

#### Puncture Wounds: Do not remove large objects (such as a knife or stick) from a wound. Call for help (911 or your 

#### local emergency number). Such objects must be removed by a doctor. Call the pediatrician for all puncture 

#### wounds. The child may need a tetanus booster. 

#### Bleeding: Apply pressure with gauze over the bleeding area for 1 to 2 minutes. If still bleeding, add more gauze 

#### and apply pressure for another 5 minutes. You can also wrap an elastic bandage firmly over gauze and apply 

#### pressure. If bleeding continues, call for help (911 or your local emergency number). 

## Eye Injuries 

#### If anything is splashed in the eye, flush gently with water for at least 15 minutes. Call Poison Help (1-800-222-1222) or 

#### the pediatrician for further advice. Any injured or painful eye should be seen by a doctor. Do NOT touch or rub an 

#### injured eye. Do NOT apply medicine. Do NOT remove objects stuck in the eye. Cover the painful or injured eye with a 

#### paper cup or eye shield until you can get medical help. 

## Fractures & Sprains 

#### If an injured area is painful, swollen, or deformed, or if motion causes pain, wrap it in a towel or soft cloth and make a 

#### splint with cardboard or other firm material to hold the arm or leg in place. Do not try to straighten. Apply ice or a cool 

#### compress wrapped in thin cloth for not more than 20 minutes. Call the pediatrician or seek emergency care. If there is 

#### a break in the skin near the fracture or if you can see the bone, cover the area with a clean bandage, make a splint as 

#### described above, and seek emergency care. 

#### If the foot or hand below the injured part is cold or discolored (blue or pale), seek emergency care right away. 

## Burns & Scalds 

#### General Treatment: First, stop the burning process by removing the child from contact with hot water or a hot 

#### object (for example, hot iron). If clothing is burning, smother flames. Remove clothing unless it is firmly stuck to 

#### the skin. Run cool water over burned skin until the pain stops. Do not apply ice, butter, grease, medicine, or 

#### ointment. 

#### Burns with Blisters: Do not break the blisters. Ask the pediatrician how to cover the burn. For burns on the face, 

#### hands, feet, or genitals, seek emergency care. 

#### Large or Deep Burns: Call 911 or your local emergency number. After stopping and cooling the burn, keep the 

#### child warm with a clean sheet covered with a blanket until help arrives. 

#### Electrical Burns: Disconnect electrical power. If the child is still in contact with an electrical source, do NOT 

#### touch the child with bare hands. Pull the child away from the power source with an object that does not conduct 

#### electricity (such as a wooden broom handle) only after the power is turned off. ALL electrical burns need to be 

#### seen by a doctor. 

## Nosebleeds 

#### Keep the child in a sitting position with the head tilted slightly forward. Apply firm, steady pressure to both nostrils by 

#### squeezing them between your thumb and index finger for 5 minutes. If bleeding continues or is very heavy, call the 

#### pediatrician or seek emergency care. 

##### Back to Top 


## Teeth 

#### Baby Teeth: If knocked out or broken, apply clean gauze to control bleeding and call the pediatric or family 

#### dentist. 

#### Permanent Teeth: If knocked out, handle the tooth by the top and not the root (the part that would be in the 

#### gum). If dirty, rinse gently without scrubbing or touching the root. Do not use any cleansers. Use cold running 

#### water or milk. Place the tooth in egg white or coconut water or, if those are unavailable, milk, saline solution (1 

#### teaspoon of table salt added to 8 ounces of water), or water, and transport the tooth with the child when seeking 

#### emergency care. If the tooth is broken, save the pieces in milk. Stop bleeding using gauze or a cotton ball in the 

#### tooth socket and have the child bite down. Call and go directly to the pediatric or family dentist or an emergency 

#### department. 

## Convulsions, Seizures 

#### If the child is breathing, lay her on her side to prevent choking. Call 911 or your local emergency number for a 

#### prolonged seizure (more than 5 minutes). 

#### Make sure the child is safe from objects that could injure her. Be sure to protect her head. Do not put anything in the 

#### child's mouth. Loosen any tight clothing. Start rescue breathing if the child is blue or not breathing. 

## Head Injuries 

#### DO NOT MOVE A CHILD WHO MAY HAVE A SERIOUS HEAD, NECK, OR BACK INJURY. This may cause further 

#### harm. 

#### Call 911 or your local emergency number right away if the child: 

#### Loses consciousness 

#### Has a seizure (convulsion) 

#### Experiences clumsiness or inability to move any body part 

#### Has oozing of blood or watery fluid from ears or nose 

#### Has abnormal speech or behavior 

#### Call the pediatrician for a child with a head injury and any of the following symptoms: 

#### Drowsiness 

#### Difficulty being awakened 

#### Persistent headache or vomiting 

#### For any questions about less serious injuries, call the pediatrician. 

## Poisons 

#### If the child has been exposed to or ingested a poison, call Poison Help at 1-800-222-1222. A poison expert is available 24 

#### hours a day, 7 days a week. 

#### Swallowed Poisons : Any nonfood substance is a potential poison. Do not give anything by mouth or induce 

#### vomiting. Call Poison Help right away. Do not delay calling, but try to have the substance label or name available 

#### when you call. 

#### Fumes, Gases, or Smoke : Get the child into fresh air and call 911, the fire department, or your local emergency 

#### number. If the child is not breathing, start CPR and continue until help arrives. 

#### Skin Exposure : If acids, lye, pesticides, chemicals, poisonous plants, or any potentially poisonous substance 

#### comes in contact with a child's skin, eyes, or hair, brush off any residual material while wearing rubber gloves, if 

#### possible. Remove contaminated clothing. Wash skin, eyes, or hair with a large amount of water or mild soap and 

#### water. Do not scrub. Call Poison Help for further advice. 

#### If a child is unconscious, becoming drowsy, having convulsions, or having trouble breathing, call 911 or your local 

#### emergency number. Bring the poisonous substance (safely contained) with you to the hospital. 

## Fainting 

#### Check the child's airway and breathing. If necessary, call 911 and begin rescue breathing and CPR. 

#### If vomiting has occurred, turn the child onto one side to prevent choking. Elevate the feet above the level of the heart 

#### (about 12 inches).

#### emergency number, call it yourself. 

### For Children 1 to 8 Years of Age: 

#### Child choking (Heimlich Maneuver): Have someone call 911. If the child is choking and is unable to breathe, cough, 

#### cry, or speak, follow these steps. 

#### Perform Heimlich maneuver. 

#### Place hand, made into a fist, and cover with other hand just above the navel. Place well below the bottom tip of the 

#### breastbone and rib cage. 

#### Give each thrust with enough force to produce an artificial cough designed to relieve airway obstruction. 

#### Perform Heimlich maneuver until the object is expelled or the child becomes unconscious/unresponsive. 

#### If the child becomes UNCONSCIOUS/UNRESPONSIVE, begin CPR. 

#### Child CPR: To be used when the infant is UNCONSCIOUS/UNRESPONSIVE or when breathing stops. Place infant on 

#### flat, hard surface.
