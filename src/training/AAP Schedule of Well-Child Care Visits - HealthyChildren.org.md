# AAP Schedule of Well-Child Care Visits 

 Parents know who they should go to when their child is sick. But pediatrician visits are just as important for healthy children. 

### The Bright Futures (http://brightfutures.aap.org/)/American 

 Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) developed a set of comprehensive health guidelines for well-child care, known as the "periodicity schedule (https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/periodicity_schedule.pdf)." It is a schedule of screenings and assessments recommended at each well-child visit from infancy through adolescence.

## The benefits of well-child visits 

 Prevention. Your child gets scheduled immunizations to prevent illness. You also can ask your pediatrician about nutrition and safety in the home and at school. 

 Tracking growth & development. See how much your child has grown in the time since your last visit, and talk with your doctor about your child's development. You can discuss your child's milestones, social behaviors and learning. 

 Raising any concerns. Make a list of topics you want to talk about with your child's pediatrician such as development, behavior, sleep, eating or getting along with other family members. Bring your top three to five questions or concerns with you to talk with your pediatrician at the start of the visit. 

 Team approach. Regular visits create strong, trustworthy relationships among pediatrician, parent and child. The AAP recommends well-child visits as a way for pediatricians and parents to serve the needs of children. This team approach helps develop optimal physical, mental and social health of a child.
