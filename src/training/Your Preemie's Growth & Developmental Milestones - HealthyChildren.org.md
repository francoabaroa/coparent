# Your Preemie's Growth & Developmental Milestones 

## Was your baby born more than 3 weeks early? Read on 

## for information from the American Academy of 

## Pediatrics about developmental milestones for your 

## preterm baby. 

## Keep in mind that babies develop at their own speed 

## and in their own way. However, parents of preemies will 

## need to adjust their baby's age to get a true sense of 

## where their baby should be in his development. 

## How to calculate your baby's adjusted age 

## Subtract the number of weeks your baby was born early from your baby's actual age in weeks (number of weeks 

## since the date of birth). This is your baby's adjusted age (also called corrected age). 

## _________________ _____________________ = ___________________ 

## Actual age Weeks born early Adjusted age 

## NOTE: The number of months is based on a 4-week month. Also, by 2 years of age, most children have caught up to 

## the typical milestone range. If your child has not caught up, he may need extra support for a longer period. 

## Examples of Adjusted Ages 

## Actual Age Weeks Born Early Adjusted Age 

## 8 weeks 

## (2 months) 

## 3 weeks 5 weeks (1 month and 1 week) 

## 16 weeks 

## (4 months) 

## 4 weeks 12 weeks (3 months) 

## 24 weeks 

## (6 months) 

## 5 weeks 19 weeks (4 months and 3 weeks) 

## Your Child's Progress 

## You know your child better than anyone else. Even with an adjusted age, you will want to see him move forward in his 

## development. For example, your child should progress from pulling himself up, to standing, and then to walking. 

## When you watch him carefully, you will see ways he is growing well. You will also know whether he needs more help. 

## Remember to take your child to his recommended well-child (health supervision) visits. At each visit, your child's 

## doctor will check his progress and ask you about the ways you see your child growing. See the next section, 

## Developmental Milestones. 


## Developmental Milestones 

##### Here is information about how babies and young children typically develop. Examples of developmental milestones 

##### for ages 1 month to 6 years are listed. The developmental milestones are listed by month or year first because well

##### child visits are organized this way. 

##### For a preterm baby, it is important to use the baby's adjusted age when tracking development until 2 years of age so 

##### that his growth and progress take into account that he was born early. 

##### What is your child's adjusted age?______________________. See milestone for the adjusted age in the next section. 

##### NOTE: Ask your baby's doctor about Early Intervention (EI)—extra care some babies and children receive to help 

##### them develop.

## At School Age 

### Ongoing Issues Your Child May Face 

##### As preterm babies get older, some of them may face ongoing physical problems (such as asthma or cerebral palsy). 

##### They may also face developmental challenges (such as difficulties paying attention or lack of motor control). This may 

##### be especially true for babies who were very small at birth. 

##### Once your child reaches school age, it will be important for you to work closely with his teacher and other school staff 

##### to identify any areas of concern. They can also help you find the right resources for help. If the school does not have 

##### the resources your child needs, his teachers can help you find local groups or programs to help him do well in school. 

##### You are not alone! Your child's teachers and health care team are dedicated to helping you meet all his health and 

##### educational needs. 

##### All children will babble before they say real words. All children will pull up to a stand before they walk. We are sure 

##### that children will develop in these patterns. However, children can reach these stages in different ways and at 

##### different times. This is especially true if they were born preterm. Take some time to think about your child's 

##### development and answer the following questions. Contact your child's doctor if you have any questions about your 

##### child's development.
