# Breastfeeding and Sexuality 

## It really shouldn’t be surprising that the experience of childbirth, a significant amount of sleep 

## deprivation, and a radically new family structure can create some very strong shock waves in a 

## couple’s relationship. Many parents are startled by the swings in their feelings about each other 

## and their desire for sexual contact. Complicating things more is the fact that each parent’s 

## experiences differ in such important ways at first—with mothers in almost constant physical 

## contact with their babies while partners look on, desiring more closeness. At the end of the day, a 

## new mother may have had so much “touching” that sex is the last thing on her mind, while the 

## non-breastfeeding partner may feel especially in need of some physical sign of her affection. 

## This is not always the case, of course. Some breastfeeding mothers (and their partners) experience less sexual desire 

## during certain phases of parenthood, while others experience more. 

## If you and your partner find that the intimacy of the breastfeeding period enhances your sexual life, or if you feel freed 

## by the natural birth control benefits of exclusive breastfeeding during the first six months, take full advantage of it. 

## If, on the other hand, your desires conflict, try to remember that this stage will pass, and focus on keeping the lines of 

## communication open in the meantime. Remember that intimacy is not equated with having sexual intercourse; 

## rather, it’s important that you and your partner feel a closeness and bond with each other. Kisses, an occasional nuzzle, 

## or a back rub may convey these feelings better than more intense physical contact. Sincere compliments can mean a 

## lot to a new mother, who may feel less “put together” than she’s used to and may feel a little self-conscious about her 

## postpartum shape. 

## While couples may feel that their sexual life has changed with the birth of the baby, studies have shown that most 

## couples resume intercourse at about seven weeks postpartum, though breastfeeding couples’ sexual activity tends to 

## resume more gradually than that of bottle-feeding couples throughout the first year. By taking into account this 

## typical pattern of sexual activity and understanding that it’s a normal part of the transition from pregnancy to life as a 

## family, you may be able to relax enough during this temporary glitch in your sex life to enjoy the wonderful changes 

## that are happening in your family. 

## Your feelings about breastfeeding 

## In a recent study, pregnant women were asked to predict what their partners’ attitudes toward breastfeeding would 

## be. Surprisingly, their responses were highly inaccurate (hardly better than random guessing). Most believed that 

## their partners were far more negative about breastfeeding than they actually were. 

## For this reason, it’s important to share your feelings about breastfeeding and new parenthood with your partner 

## whenever possible. Such conversations can help preserve the intimacy of your relationship during the physically 

## challenging early months, while also supporting your partner in her breastfeeding efforts at a time when every 

## encouraging word helps. 

## If you love the sight of her breastfeeding your baby, tell her how it makes you feel. If you consider her nursing 

## mother’s figure just as sexy, let her know. Share with her your pride in her commitment to breastfeeding as she 

## breastfeeds in public and makes herself available to satisfy your child’s hunger at all times. 

## Such words of support and affirmation can act as a highly effective aphrodisiac for many new mothers (if not now, 

## then later) and may improve your relationship even as they ensure your child’s continued good health.
