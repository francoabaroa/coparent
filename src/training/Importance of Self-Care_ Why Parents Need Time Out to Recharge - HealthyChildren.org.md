# Importance of Self-Care: Why Parents Need Time Out to 

# Recharge 

## By: Whitney Casares, MD, MPH, FAAP 

## I remember a mommy friend telling me she had 

## booked a day with a massage and a pedicure for herself 

## a month after her second daughter arrived, and I felt 

## slightly annoyed. She said she needed it. Really? What a 

## seemingly selfish thing to do. But, in reality, she was 

## doing herself and her family a huge favor. 

## Taking small chunks of time for yourself as early on as possible is one of the best ways to keep yourself from feeling 

## trapped as a new parent. Keeping yourself happy and healthy will allow you to give the best care possible to your 

## new baby. You forget that you need a mental break sometimes to recharge your battery. 

## Make a self-care plan 

## The reality is, the only way to take the best care of your family is to make sure you're taking time to take care of 

## yourself. Can you push through and be a mommy martyr for the next 18 years? Sure. Will it leave you resentful and 

## angry? Most definitely. 

## Even though self-help is necessary, it's helpful to remember one simple principle: you cannot have it all as a new 

## mom. I know the media tells you otherwise. I know it seems like you should be having it all. But look at your life. Do 

## you have it all now? Even when you've tried your best at it? Even without kids? I didn't. 

## I could never look exactly the way I wanted and be the best at my job and always have a hopping social calendar and 

## travel the world and have tons of money in the bank and be peaceful and happy all the time at the same time. Anyone 

## who tries to sell you otherwise is selling you lies. 

## You do, though, have time for the top 3 priorities in your life that are unique to you and your growing family. And if you 

## choose things that really do fit your needs (as opposed to what other people want you to do), you will have more space 

## for the extras. 

## Ideals & reality 

## My friend Christie is a business executive coach. She spends all day guiding leaders personally and professionally as 

## they make million-dollar decisions. One night, discussing life at a bar, she took a cocktail napkin and wrote out the 

## major categories of life—kids, spouse, work, exercise, friendships, hobbies, homemaking, travel and experiences, and 

## appearance. For clarification, exercise to me meant releasing endorphins, stress reduction, and meditation, whereas 

## appearance included everything that goes into looking put together (including exercise for the purpose of having a 

## good appearance). 

## She wrote them in random order and then asked me to rank them in order in the left-hand column according to what 

## I, in an ideal world, would spend the most time doing. “Rank them as a private, honest list, not based at all on what 

## other people would think is the right way to rank them," she said. 

## I called it my ideal list. 

## IDEAL LIST 


#### 1. Exercise and stress reduction 

#### 2. Kids 

#### 3. Travel and experiences 

#### 4. Hobbies and sports (including writing and reading) 

#### 5. Partner 

#### 6. Friendships 

#### 7. Homemaking (tasks such as laundry and dishes) 

#### 8. Appearance 

#### 9. Work 

#### In the next column, she asked me to rank what I thought I spent my time on. 

### Here is my reality list.

#### Look at the striking comparison between what my ideal life looked like and what my actual life looked like. This 

#### exercise is what convinced me to make a change in my life. Also, notice that while my kids ranked high on the list, they 

#### were not first. That's OK. In fact, it's probably healthier. Because, in the end, my kids are going to grow up and do their 

#### own thing (yours will too). My husband was also not first. That's OK too. It's important we have separate interests and 

#### desires, which we can build only if we spend some time doing things separately. 

#### You might be thinking, “I'm going to have to work!" That is true for me too. That's how I pay for all the music classes, 

#### the nanny, and the nutritious quality food I want to provide for my kids in the first place. It's how my daughter goes to 

#### that fun preschool the nanny drops her off at. It's how we make sure we get to live in the house we do and get our kids 

#### into the great school district that they will eventually go to. There is not going to be some overhaul of my life that 

#### allows me to live work-free and spend all day sipping lattes while I supervise my children. 

#### Also, you might have a different top 3 than I do, and that is totally fine. My husband is a huge extrovert. I had him make 

#### this list, and his was in a completely different order. No problem. That's the beauty of it. 

#### I'm not saying don't go to work or don't figure out a way to get your house clean once your newborn arrives, but, as my 

#### friend says, “Work is like a parasite. It will leach out of you as much as you will give to it." Same with housecleaning 

#### and coordinating 80 million schedules. Of course, we have to do some of that to keep things running smoothly, but we 

#### can't let them suck the life out of us. The rest of the things on the list you'll have to consider like gravy or a cherry on 

#### top if you can get to them, at least in the early weeks and months of motherhood. 

#### It's OK if your makeup isn't perfect, your socks aren't organized, and you can't remember the last time you cooked 

#### something more complicated than a quesadilla. 

#### Sounds good to get your priorities in line from the get-go, right? But it takes a little preplanning to make it happen. I 

#### learned early on that to do all I do, I have to automate and delegate.
