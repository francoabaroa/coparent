# Bottlemouth Syndrome 

## Bottlemouth syndrome is a special form of tooth decay (/English/healthy-living/oral

## health/Pages/Preventing-Tooth-Decay-in-Children.aspx)in very young children. It is caused by 

## prolonged exposure to milk or sugary liquids. Children at risk for bottlemouth syndrome take 

## bottles of milk or juice (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Where-We-Stand-Fruit

## Juice.aspx) to bed at naptime and bedtime. They also carry sugary beverages or milk around 

## during the day. It is most common in the upper front teeth. Children with bottlemouth syndrome 

## often need oral surgery with general anesthesia (/English/health

## issues/conditions/treatments/Pages/Procedures-With-Anesthesia.aspx). 

## What to Look For: 

## Red gums 

## Irritated mouth 

## Teeth that do not look normal 

## What You Should Do: 

## Parents or primary caregiver should: 

## Do not give your child a bottle of milk or juice (or any fluid containing sugar) at naptime, bedtime, or to carry 

## around during the day. Only feed your child at specific meal and snack times. 

## Give your child water after a feeding to rinse sugary liquid off the teeth. 

## Give only water or don’t give a sleep-time bottle. 

## Other Caregivers Should: 

## Talk with parents about the need to have the child’s teeth examined by a medical provider.
