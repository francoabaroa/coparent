# How to Get Your Child to Eat More Fruits & Veggies 

## We all know that eating fruits and vegetables is important. But how 

## do you get kids to eat more of these foods? 

## Tips for Parents: 

## Provide fruits and vegetables as snacks. Keep fruit washed, cut 

## up and in plain sight in the refrigerator. 

## Serve salads more often. Get prewashed, bagged salad at the 

## grocery store. Teach your child what an appropriate amount of 

## salad dressing is and how it can be ordered on the side 

## at restaurants (/English/ages

## stages/teen/nutrition/Pages/Healthy-and-Unhealthy-Choices-at-Fast-Food-Restaurants.aspx). 

## Try out vegetarian (/English/ages-stages/teen/nutrition/Pages/What-Makes-A-Vegetarian.aspx) recipes for 

## spaghetti, lasagna, chili, or other foods using vegetables instead of meat. 

## Include at least one leafy green or yellow vegetable for vitamin A such as spinach, broccoli, winter squash, 

## greens, or carrots each day. 

## Include at least one vitamin C (/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/nutrition/Pages/Vitamin-C-and

## Children.aspx)–rich fruit or vegetable, such as oranges, grapefruit, strawberries, melon, tomato, and broccoli each 

## day. 

## Add a fruit or vegetable as part of every meal or snack. For example, you could put fruit on cereal 

## (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/The-Scoop-on-Ready-to-Eat-Breakfast-Cereals.aspx), add a piece of 

## fruit or small salad to your child’s lunch, use vegetables and dip for an after-school snack, or add a vegetable or 

## two you want to try to the family’s dinner. 

## Be a role model—eat more fruits and vegetables yourself. 

## More Things You Can Do: 

## Be sure your child is getting the recommended amount of fruits and vegetables each day. Visit 

## choosemyplate.gov (https://www.choosemyplate.gov/) to find out how much of each food group your child 

## should be getting. 

## When shopping for food, start in the area of the store where they keep fresh fruits and vegetables. Stock up. That 

## way you know you always have some on hand to serve your child. 

## Avoid buying high-calorie foods such as chips, cookies, and candy bars. Your child may not ask for these treats if 

## they are not in sight. 

## Limit or eliminate how much fruit juice (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Where-We-Stand-Fruit

## Juice.aspx) you give your child and make sure it is 100% juice, not juice “drinks.” 

## Eat a s a family whenever possible. Research shows that kids eat more vegetables and fruits and less fried foods 

## and sugary drinks when they eat with the entire family. 

## Remember... 

## By choosing health-promoting foods, you can establish good nutritional habits in your child that will last for the rest of 

## his or her life.
