# Cereal in a Bottle: Solid Food Shortcuts to Avoid 

## While the habit of adding cereal to an infant’s bottle is one that has been around for a long time, 

## there are several compelling reasons why you really shouldn’t do it unless advised by your 

## pediatrician. 

## Ready or Not: 

## A baby’s digestive system is not thought to be well prepared to process cereal until about 

## 6 months of age. When he is old enough to digest cereal, he should also be ready to eat it from a 

## spoon. 

## Note: The AAP recommends breastfeeding as the sole source of nutrition for your baby for about 6 months. When 

## you add solid foods to your baby’s diet, continue breastfeeding until at least 12 months. You can continue to breastfeed 

## after 12 months if you and your baby desire. Check with your child’s doctor about vitamin D and iron supplements 

## during the first year. 

## Too Hard to Handle: 

## Offering cereal in a bottle (or even on a spoon) before babies are developmentally ready can increase the likelihood of 

## gagging and/or inhaling the thickened mixture into their lungs. Unless there’s a medical reason for giving it early, it’s 

## not worth jumping the gun. 

## Allergy Activation: 

## Exposure to solid foods (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Switching-To-Solid-Foods.aspx) before 

## the age of 4 months may put babies at risk for developing food allergies (/English/healthy

## living/nutrition/Pages/Food-Allergies-in-Children.aspx) in the future—a risk that can be minimized by simply waiting 

## until 4 to 6 months when the time is right. 

## Overfeeding: 

## Perhaps the biggest reason not to take the addition of cereal in a bottle too lightly relates to overfeeding. By instinct, 

## your baby knows how much breast milk (/english/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/default.aspx) or formula 

## (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Amount-and-Schedule-of-Formula-Feedings.aspx) to drink 

## based on volume, not calories. While it is said to be difficult to overfeed a baby, this applies when you’re talking about 

## breast milk or formula alone. As soon as cereal gets added in, things get a little murky—so murky, in fact, that putting 

## cereal in the bottle is considered by some to be a form of force-feeding that can cause babies to “overdose” on 

## calories.
