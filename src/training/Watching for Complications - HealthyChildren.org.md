# Watching for Complications 

## “In the beginning, you expect complications and scary moments. In intermediate care, setbacks 

## are more surprising, more disappointing, because you think those times are behind you.” 

## When your baby is stable enough to graduate to intermediate care, she is generally considered 

## past the real dangers that may have been present while she was critically ill. A few medical 

## conditions can affect progress, but most cause only a temporary setback. Rarely, these conditions 

## can mean readmission to the NICU. 

## Apnea and Bradycardia 

## Apnea, bradycardia, and desaturation often occur in babies born at less than 32 weeks’ gestation, and episodes may 

## continue in the intermediate care nursery. The staff will monitor the frequency, intensity, and duration of the 

## episodes. If your baby was not having apnea or bradycardia in the NICU or if the frequency or intensity of the episodes 

## increases now, this may be a sign of illness. If this happens, the physician, neonatal nurse practitioner, or physician 

## assistant will order tests to find the cause. If the apnea and bradycardia are because of immaturity, your baby may 

## receive medication (theophylline or caffeine) to decrease the episodes. If your baby is put on medication, drug levels 

## in the blood may be checked periodically. As your infant grows, the doctor adjusts the dosage or allows your baby to 

## outgrow the dose if apnea and bradycardia resolve. Unless they are a side effect of another illness, apnea and 

## bradycardia often resolve around your baby’s original due date. If your baby is ready to go home before that date, mild 

## apnea and bradycardia may need to be managed before discharge. Management of the situation depends on the 

## philosophy of your baby’s neonatologists. Your baby may require continued monitoring in the hospital, may require 

## testing with a pneumogram before discharge, or may be a candidate for home monitoring and/or medication. If your 

## baby goes home with a monitor, you’ll be instructed in monitor use and infant CPR. 

## Infection 

## Your recovering baby is prone to many kinds of infection. Despite the best precautions of staff and visitors, infections 

## do occur. Some infections, such as thrush, are minor and respond to treatment rapidly. Others can be more serious. 

## Thrush 

## Your baby might get a yeast infection—called thrush—in her mouth. It looks like thick white patches on the tongue or 

## gums. You cannot wipe these patches off. Infants with thrush often have feeding problems because of tenderness in 

## the affected area. Thrush is usually treated with oral medication. 

## Other Infections 

## Signs of other infections may include feeding difficulties (intolerance, vomiting, abdominal swelling, or poor feeding), 

## decreased activity, increased frequency of apnea and bradycardia, unstable temperature, and increased work of 

## breathing. When the health care team becomes aware of these signs, your baby may have blood work, a spinal tap, a 

## urine culture, or x-rays to identify the cause of infection. Intravenous antibiotics may be started, and your baby may be 

## made NPO (no nutrition by mouth) as a precaution. Rarely, your baby may be transferred back to the NICU for 

## respiratory support, for increased monitoring, or simply for IV medications. It is also rare that a baby overwhelmed by 

## an infection will die. Most infections respond well to treatment, and your infant will be back to normal in 2 or 3 days. 

## Hernias 

## Preterm infants are at risk for hernias—protrusion of a body part (such as a loop of intestine) through a muscle 

## weakness or unusual opening inside the body. If your baby develops a hernia, most eventually require surgical repair. 


## Inguinal Hernia 

### The most common hernia is called an inguinal hernia. This condition occurs most often in males and usually presents 

#### as a bulge in the groin, especially after crying or straining during a bowel movement. Sometimes girls get inguinal 

#### hernias, which cause a bulge, or swelling, above or along the labia. Usually a boy’s testicles stay in the inguinal canal 

#### (high in the groin, not down in the scrotal sac) until about 32 weeks’ gestation. At that time, the testicles descend into 

#### the scrotum. But in preterm babies, part of the intestine may push through a remaining gap in the muscle wall into the 

#### scrotum. This may affect one or both sides and appears as a swelling above or in the scrotum. As long as the hernia is 

#### reducible (the intestine can be easily and gently pushed back through the opening), immediate surgical correction is 

#### not necessary. Surgery to repair the hernia may occur before discharge or around the time your baby weighs around 2 

#### kilograms (or 4½ pounds). Surgery can also be postponed until the child is older or requires other surgery. If the 

#### hernia becomes incarcerated (trapped in the scrotum), the scrotum will become blue and painful, and immediate 

#### surgery is necessary. 

## Umbilical Hernia 

#### Another area where the muscle may not close properly is around the umbilical cord. An umbilical hernia causes the 

#### umbilical area, or belly button, to push outward when the baby cries. As long as there is no redness or discoloration, 

#### there is no cause for concern. This condition usually corrects itself as your baby grows and the abdominal muscles 

#### strengthen and thicken. In general, surgical correction is not recommended before the age of 3 to 5 years. 

## Gastroesophageal Reflux 

### A condition known as gastroesophageal reflux (GER) occurs when the opening at the entrance of the stomach has not 

#### matured and allows food to move back up the esophagus. A baby with GER might vomit 3 or 4 times per day and loses a 

#### significant amount of her feedings. She may have episodes of apnea, bradycardia and desaturation during feeding, 

#### signs of discomfort during feeding, difficulty advancing volume, poor digestion, and poor weight gain. Many preterm 

#### babies show symptoms of GER and most outgrow it as they reach term age (their original due date). 

#### A variety of factors may contribute to the dysfunction of the junction at the esophagus and stomach. Reflux may be 

#### caused by respiratory distress that causes the diaphragm and abdominal muscles to work harder than they should, 

#### positioning an infant on her back, bearing down with abdominal muscles during movement, and large volumes of food 

#### causing pressure on the junction at the esophagus and stomach. Feeding small amounts more frequently, feeding 

#### continuously by pump (although gavage tubes are associated with increased reflux symptoms), raising the head of the 

#### bed, or placing the baby on her tummy after feeding may help alleviate this condition. If tummy positioning is used, 

#### continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring must be used and the baby must be transitioned to back sleeping prior to 

#### discharge to reduce SIDS risk. If the condition is severe, treatment may include medication or surgery. The surgery to 

### correct reflux is called fundoplication. 

## Anemia 

#### While your baby is in intermediate care, blood counts (hematocrit or hemoglobin) will be checked weekly or as the 

#### baby’s situation requires. Preterm NICU babies are at risk for anemia (low red blood cell count) because their NICU 

#### stay required drawing of blood for testing and evaluation of treatment, and the body system that makes red blood cells 

#### (RBCs) is immature. Rapid growth also causes a decrease in blood counts. Babies often cannot replenish their blood 

#### supply fast enough to keep up with the necessary blood tests in the NICU; therefore, blood transfusions may be given 

#### to correct anemia. In some institutions, the medication Epogen (EPO) is given to help stimulate RBC production. 

#### Anemia can cause low oxygen and glucose levels in the blood, which can cause the tissues and organs to function 

#### improperly. Infants with anemia may appear pale and lethargic, have an increase in apnea and/or bradycardia, and not 

#### eat well. Infants on respiratory support may have regular transfusions. Keeping the blood count normal is important 

#### for keeping oxygen levels normal and allowing timely weaning from oxygen. 

#### Most babies who have graduated to intermediate care are able to maintain their oxygen levels without help, so they 

#### shouldn’t require many transfusions. In intermediate care, blood counts are allowed to drop lower than in the NICU to 

#### stimulate the baby’s own RBC production system. When an infant receives transfusions, the production of RBCs in 

#### the bone marrow is not stimulated. A low RBC count is the necessary stimulus to trigger production. As with all 

#### immature systems, full functioning takes time. 

#### When the hemoglobin and hematocrit drop, the body system that produces RBCs is stimulated to replenish the lost 

### supply. A blood test called a reticulocyte count (retic) shows the amount of developing RBCs produced. If the retic 

#### count is within normal limits, transfusion will be postponed in the hope that the baby’s system will do its job. In most 

#### infants, the process corrects itself without complication. Occasionally a baby may be transfused in the week before 

#### discharge. In that case, your health care provider’s office may schedule follow-up lab work after discharge.
