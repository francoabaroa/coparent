# Baby’s First Tooth: 7 Facts Parents Should Know 

## By: Dina DiMaggio, MD, FAAP & Julie Cernigliaro, DMD 

## 1. Most babies will develop teeth 

## between 6 and 12 months. 

## There is a wide range of variability of when a first tooth may appear 

## —some babies may not have any teeth by their first birthday 

## (/English/ages-stages/Your-Childs-Checkups/Pages/Your

## Checkup-Checklist-12-Months-Old.aspx)! Around 3 months of age, 

## babies will begin exploring the world with their mouth and have 

## increased saliva and start to put their hands in their mouth. Many 

## parents question whether or not this means that their baby is teething, but a first tooth usually appears around 6 

## months old (/English/ages-stages/Your-Childs-Checkups/Pages/Your-Checkup-Checklist-6-months-old.aspx). 

## Typically, the first teeth to come in are almost always the lower front teeth (the lower central incisors), and most 

## children will usually have all of their baby teeth by age 3. 

## 2. Fluoride should be added to your child's diet at 6 months of age. 

## Fluoride is a mineral that helps prevent tooth decay (/English/ages-stages/baby/teething-tooth-care/Pages/How-to

## Prevent-Tooth-Decay-in-Your-Baby.aspx) by hardening the enamel of teeth. The good news is that fluoride is often 

## added to tap water (/English/healthy-living/oral-health/Pages/Water-Fluoridation.aspx). Give your baby a few ounces 

## of water (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Choose-Water-for-Healthy-Hydration.aspx) in a sippy or straw cup 

## when you begin them on solid foods (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Starting-Solid-Foods.aspx) 

## (about 6 months of age). Speak with your pediatrician to see if your tap water contains fluoride or whether your child 

## needs fluoride supplements. Fluoride is not typically found in most bottled water. See FAQ: Fluoride and Children 

## (/English/healthy-living/oral-health/Pages/FAQ-Fluoride-and-Children.aspx) for more information. 


## 3. Massaging sore gums, offering something cold, or acetaminophen, 

## on an occasional rough night, can help soothe your baby's teething 

## pain. 

##### Usually teething doesn't cause children too much discomfort, however, many parents can tell when their baby is 

##### teething. Babies may show signs of discomfort in the area where the tooth is coming in, the gums around the tooth 

##### may be swollen and tender, and the baby may drool (/English/ages-stages/baby/teething-tooth-care/Pages/Drooling

##### and-Your-Baby.aspx) a lot more than usual. 

##### Parents can help ease teething pain (/English/ages-stages/baby/teething-tooth-care/Pages/How-to-Help-Teething

##### Symptoms-without-Medications.aspx) by massaging their baby's gums with clean fingers, offering solid, not liquid

##### filled, teething rings or a clean frozen or wet washcloth. If you offer a teething biscuit, make sure to watch your baby 

##### while they are eating it. Chunks can break off easily and can lead to choking. Also, these biscuits are not very 

##### nutritious and most contain sugar and salt. 

#### A baby's body temperature may slightly rise when teething; however, according to a 2016 study in Pediatrics 

##### (http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2016/02/03/peds.2015-3501), a true fever (temperature over 100.4 

##### degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius) is not associated with teething and is actually a sign of an illness or 

##### infection that may require treatment. If your baby is clearly uncomfortable, talk with your pediatrician about giving a 

##### weight-appropriate dose of acetaminophen (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/at

##### home/medication-safety/Pages/Acetaminophen-for-Fever-and-Pain.aspx) (e.g., Tylenol) or if over 6 months, ibuprofen 

##### (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/at-home/medication-safety/Pages/Ibuprofen-for-Fever

##### and-Pain.aspx) (e.g., Advil, Motrin). Make sure to ask your pediatrician for the right dose in milliliters (mL) based on 

##### your child's age and weight. 

##### Many children, however, will have no problems at all when their teeth come in! 

## 4. Do not use teething tablets, gels with benzocaine, homeopathic 

## teething gels or tablets, or amber teething necklaces. 

##### Stay away from teething tablets that contain the plant poison belladonna and gels with benzocaine. Belladonna 

##### (http://www.fda.gov/forconsumers/consumerupdates/ucm230762.htm) and benzocaine 

##### (http://www.fda.gov/forconsumers/consumerupdates/ucm306062.htm) are marketed to numb your child's pain, but 

##### the FDA has issued warnings (https://www.fda.gov/drugs/information-drug-class/fda-warns-consumers-about

##### homeopathic-teething

##### products#:~:text=The%20FDA%20is%20warning%20consumers%2cof%20any%20in%20their%20possession.)against 

##### both due to potential side effects. 

##### In addition, amber teething necklaces are not recommended. Necklaces placed around an infant's neck can pose a 

##### strangulation risk or be a potential choking hazard. There is also no research to support the necklace's effectiveness. 

#### See Teething Necklaces and Beads: A Caution for Parents (/English/ages-stages/baby/teething-tooth

#### care/Pages/Amber-Teething-Necklaces.aspx) for more information. 

## 5. You should brush your child's teeth twice a day with fluoride 

## toothpaste. 

##### Once your child has a tooth, you should be 

##### brushing them twice a day with a smear of 

##### fluoride toothpaste the size of a grain of rice, 

##### especially after the last drink or food of the day. 

##### Remember not to put your baby to bed with a 

##### bottle—it can lead to tooth decay. 

##### Once your child turns 3, the American Academy 

##### of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Dental 

##### Association (ADA), and the American Academy 

##### of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD)recommend that a pea-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste be used when brushing. 

##### When your child is able, teach them to spit out the excess toothpaste. It is best if you put the toothpaste on the 

##### toothbrush until your child is about age 6. Parents should monitor and assist their child while brushing until they are 

##### around 7 or 8 years old. When your child can write their name well, he or she also has the ability to brush well.

## 6. Ask your pediatrician about your baby's teeth and fluoride varnish 

## (/English/healthy-living/oral-health/Pages/Fluoride-Varnish-What

## Parents-Need-to-Know.aspx). 

##### During regular well-child visits (/English/family-life/health-management/Pages/Well-Child-Care-A-Check-Up-for

##### Success.aspx), your pediatrician will check your baby's teeth and gums to ensure they are healthy and talk to you 

##### about how to keep them that way. The AAP and the United States Preventive Services Task Force also recommend that 

##### children receive fluoride varnish once they have teeth. 

##### If your child does not yet have a dentist, ask your pediatrician if they can apply fluoride varnish to your baby's teeth. 

##### Once your child has a dentist, the varnish can be applied in the dental office. The earlier your child receives fluoride 

##### varnish the better to help prevent tooth decay. 

## 7. Make your first dental appointment when the first tooth appears. 

##### Try to make your baby's first dental appointment after the eruption of the first tooth and by his or her first birthday. 

##### Both the AAP and the AAPD recommend that all children see a pediatric dentist and establish a "dental home" by age 

##### one. A pediatric dentist will make sure all teeth are developing normally and that there are no dental problems. They 

##### will also give you further advice on proper hygiene. If you don't have a pediatric dentist in your community, find a 

##### general dentist who is comfortable seeing young children.
