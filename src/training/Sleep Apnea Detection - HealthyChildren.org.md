# Sleep Apnea Detection 

## Sleep apnea is a common problem that affects an estimated 2% of all children, including many 

## who are undiagnosed. 

## If not treated, sleep apnea can lead to a variety of problems. These include heart, behavior, 

## learning, and growth problems. 

## Symptoms of sleep apnea include: 

## Frequent snoring 

## Problems breathing during the night 

## Sleepiness during the day 

## Difficulty paying attention 

## Behavior problems (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/communication-discipline/Pages/Evaluating

## Behavioral-Problems.aspx) 

## If you notice any of these symptoms, let your pediatrician know as soon as possible. Your pediatrician may 

## recommend an overnight sleep study called a polysomnogram. Overnight polysomnograms are conducted at 

## hospitals and major medical centers. During the study, medical staff will watch your child sleep. Several sensors will 

## be attached to your child to monitor (/English/ages-stages/baby/preemie/Pages/Apnea-Monitors.aspx) breathing, 

## oxygenation, and brain waves (electroencephalogram; EEG). 

## The results of the study will show whether your child suffers from sleep apnea. Other specialists, such as pediatric 

## pulmonologists (/English/family-life/health-management/pediatric-specialists/Pages/What-is-a-Pediatric

## Pulmonologist.aspx), otolaryngologists (/English/family-life/health-management/pediatric-specialists/pages/What

## is-a-Pediatric-Otolaryngologist.aspx), neurologists, and pediatricians with specialty training in sleep disorders, may 

## help your pediatrician make the diagnosis. 

## Treatment 

## Many children with sleep apnea have larger tonsils (/English/health-issues/conditions/ear-nose-throat/Pages/The

## Difference-Between-a-Sore-Throat-Strep-and-Tonsillitis.aspx) and adenoids. The most common way to treat sleep 

## apnea is to remove your child's tonsils and adenoid. This surgery is called a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. It is 

## highly effective in treating sleep apnea. 

## Another effective treatment is nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which requires the child to wear a 

## mask while he sleeps. The mask delivers steady air pressure through the child's nose, allowing him to breathe 

## comfortably. Continuous positive airway pressure is usually used in children who do not improve after tonsillectomy 

## and adenoidectomy, or who are not candidates for tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. 

## Children born with other medical conditions, such as Down syndrome (/English/health

## issues/conditions/developmental-disabilities/Pages/Down-Syndrome.aspx), cerebral palsy (/English/health

## issues/conditions/developmental-disabilities/Pages/Cerebral-Palsy.aspx), or craniofacial (skull and face) 

## abnormalities (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Positional-Skull-Deformities-in-Infants-Audio.aspx), are at higher 

## risk for sleep apnea. Children with these conditions may need additional treatments. Overweight children 

## (/english/health-issues/conditions/obesity/Pages/default.aspx)are also more likely to suffer from sleep apnea. Most 

## overweight children will improve if they lose weight, but may need to use CPAP until the weight is lost. 

## Remember 

## A good night's sleep is important to good health. If your child suffers from the symptoms of sleep apnea, talk with your 

## pediatrician. A proper diagnosis and treatment can mean restful nights and restful days for your child and your 

## family.
