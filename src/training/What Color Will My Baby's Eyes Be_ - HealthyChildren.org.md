# What Color Will My Baby's Eyes Be? 

## By: David Hill, MD, FAAP 

## New parents often ask what color I think the baby’s 

## eyes are going to be. I never answer this question until 

## the child is at least 1 year old; I mean, what if the parents 

## believe me and use my answer to make major life 

## decisions? When we talk about eye color, we’re really 

## talking about the appearance of the iris, the muscular 

## ring around the pupil that controls how much light 

## enters the eye. After all, the pupil will always be black, 

## except in flash photos, and the whites (sclera) should 

## stay pretty much white, although jaundice 

## (/English/tips-tools/Symptom

## Checker/Pages/symptomviewer.aspx?symptom=Jaundiced+Newborn) may turn them yellow and inflammation may 

## make them look pink or red. 

## Eye color changes over time 

## Iris color, just like hair and skin color, depends on a protein called melanin. We have specialized cells in our bodies 

## called melanocytes whose job it is to go around secreting melanin. Over time, if melanocytes only secrete a little 

## melanin, your baby will have blue eyes. If they secrete a bit more, his eyes will look green or hazel. When 

## melanocytes get really busy, eyes look brown (the most common eye color), and in some cases they may appear very 

## dark indeed. 

## Because it takes about a year for melanocytes to finish their work it can be a dicey business calling eye color before 

## the baby’s first birthday. The color change does slow down some after the first 6 months of life, but there can be plenty 

## of change left at that point. 

## Eye color is a genetic property, but it’s not quite as cut-and-dried as you might have learned in biology class. 

## Two blue-eyed parents are very likely to have a blue-eyed child, but it won’t happen every single time. 

## Two brown-eyed parents are likely (but not guaranteed) to have a child with brown eyes. 

## If you notice one of the grandparents has blue eyes, the chances of having a blue-eyed baby go up a bit. 

## If one parent has brown eyes and the other has blue eyes, odds are about even on eye color. 

## If your child has one brown eye and one blue eye, bring it to your doctor’s attention; he probably has a rare 

## genetic condition called Waardenburg syndrome. 

## Cross-eyed? 

## Parents also often note that their newborns’ eyes appear to cross from time to time. For the first 6 months of life this 

## can be normal. To begin with, to look at something the brain has to know where to point the eyes. For the first 2 to 4 

## weeks of life vision is not accurate enough for the baby’s eyes to find a target a lot of the time. Parents often feel like 

## their newborns are looking past them rather than at them, because they are. By the fourth week of life, however, your 

## baby will focus on your face if you’re cradling him. 

## Most visual development occurs in the brain, not in the eyes themselves. One of the greatest challenges for the 

## developing brain is to coordinate visual signals from one side to the other. Nerve signals from the eyes travel through 

## optic nerves and split off to both sides of the brain. To make sense of those signals, the 2 sides of the brain have to 

## cooperate, comparing information and coordinating eye movement in the desired direction. Until age 2 months you 

## may notice your infant will follow your face or a toy a little way, then lose it as it crosses from one side to the other. By 2 

## months, however, he should be able to track from right to left and back again.

#### The next big visual milestone occurs at 6 months of age. By this time the 2 sides of the brain are on good terms with 

#### each other. Until this point the eyes track together as long as they both have something to look at, but if one is 

#### deprived of input (from being covered by a hat, for example), it might drift off in its own direction. By 6 months of age 

#### the eyes should continue looking the same direction even if one of them is covered temporarily. We test this in the 

#### clinic by covering 1 eye for 3 seconds, then suddenly uncovering it and looking to see if it’s still tracking with the 

#### opposite eye. We call this test the cover-uncover test. 

#### Sometimes the shape of a child’s face makes it look as though the eyes are crossed even when they are not. A child 

#### with a broad nasal bridge may appear to have an inward-looking eye, when in fact he’s just looking off to the side. You 

#### can check this by watching the light reflection in your child’s eyes from a window or lamp; if it falls in the same place 

#### on each eye, the eyes are working together. 

## Lazy eye (amblyophobia) 

#### Even with office screening, however, we don’t always catch an eye that tends to deviate. Deviations occur more often 

#### when the child is tired. If you ever notice that your 6-month-old or older child has an eye that doesn’t always look the 

#### same way as its partner, alert his doctor. It’s critical that an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) (/English/family

#### life/health-management/pediatric-specialists/Pages/What-is-a-Pediatric-Ophthalmologist.aspx) examine the child. 

#### What some people call a lazy eye (amblyopia) (/English/health-issues/conditions/eyes/Pages/Amblyopia-Lazy

#### Eye.aspx) may be a sign that one eye doesn’t see as clearly as the other. When the brain is forced to make 1 picture 

#### from 2 very different inputs, it starts to ignore the signals from the worse eye. Over time this process becomes 

#### irreversible, leading to partial blindness in the weaker eye. In most cases, you should address the problem before the 

#### child turns 3 to ensure he’ll grow up with normal depth perception. Treatments for amblyopia vary based on the cause 

#### and severity of the condition. Some children require glasses or patches that force the brain to pay attention to signals 

#### from the weaker eye. Other kids need surgery to shorten or lengthen certain muscles that control eye movement.
