# Taking the Mystery Out of Toothbrush Storage 

## It’s a fact that bacteria can grow on toothbrushes after they’ve been used, especially if wet 

## toothbrushes are kept in closed, dark places. Wet toothbrush bristles should not be covered. 

## They should air dry. 

## The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 

## Recommends: 

## After brushing, it’s best to rinse toothbrushes with water to clean off remaining toothpaste and 

## small pieces of food. Then the toothbrushes should be stored in an upright position to air dry. If several toothbrushes 

## are stored in the same holder, make sure there is enough space between the toothbrushes so that they do not touch 

## each other. Remember to label each toothbrush with the child’s name. 

## Do not soak toothbrushes in bleach water or other disinfecting solutions (/English/health

## issues/conditions/prevention/Pages/Cleaners-Sanitizers-Disinfectants.aspx). And toothbrushes do not need to be 

## placed in dishwashers, microwaves, or ultraviolet devices to disinfect them. These methods may damage the 

## toothbrushes.
