# When Not To Wean 

## In most cases, the decision to wean can be based on a mother’s and child’s inner needs and 

## practical considerations relating to the family. However, it’s best to put off weaning in some 

## situations until a time when conditions are better. Such situations include: 

## Food allergies. If you or your child’s father have experienced food allergies, talk with your 

## child’s pediatrician or other health professional about the benefits of delaying weaning until 

## at least after your child’s first birthday. Avoiding cow’s milk or cow’smilk-based products 

## may be helpful. 

## Illness. If your child has a cold, is teething, has recently been hospitalized, or is otherwise 

## not in tip-top shape, put off initiating the weaning process until he feels better. You might also want to delay your 

## first attempts if you feel under the weather. It’s always best to meet any transition period when you and your 

## child are at your physical and emotional best. 

## Changes at home. If you are pregnant or have recently had a new baby, this may not be the best time to wean, 

## unless led by your child. On the other hand, your needs and the needs of a newborn may take priority. Always 

## breastfeed the newborn first, but try to be sensitive to the needs of everyone involved. Likewise, a move to a new 

## home, a marital disruption, a new child care situation, your return to work, and other potentially stressful 

## situations are not the best times to initiate another major change. Ideally, you will begin weaning when it’s not 

## overly stressful for you or your child.
