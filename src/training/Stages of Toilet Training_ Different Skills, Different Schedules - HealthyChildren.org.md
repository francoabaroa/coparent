# Stages of Toilet Training: Different Skills, Different 

# Schedules 

## One of the most difficult aspects of toilet training for many parents is the uneven pace at which 

## different types of training occur. Your child may learn to urinate into a potty quite easily but take 

## several more months to start having bowel movements there. Daytime training may have been a 

## breeze for your toddler, but he continues to wet the bed frequently through age five. 

## Since the order and speed with which each of these skills is mastered may differ from child to 

## child, it is impossible to compare one child’s mastery with another’s to determine whether your 

## child’s progress is “normal.” In most cases, the best response to uneven adoption of skills is to 

## remain patient and supportive, giving your child the time he needs to take the next step toward 

## complete success. 

## Delays in bowel control can be particularly disturbing for many parents, however—especially when children exhibit 

## such puzzling behavior as secretly depositing bowel movements in a closet or other hiding place, smearing feces on 

## the wall or other surface, or bursting into tears when their stool is flushed down the toilet. Our own adult associations 

## with bowel movements are so negative that it is hard to remember that very young children have little awareness of 

## the presence of germs, the potential for mess, the attached cultural stigma, and so on. 

## On the contrary, toddlers and preschoolers are often extremely proud of the product their bodies have created— 

## expecting praise and admiration, not displeasure—and are reluctant or even anxious at the prospect of letting these 

## products go. This reluctance can grow even stronger during periods when mastery of their body or privacy becomes a 

## high-priority issue in their lives, or when they are experiencing a fear of the potty or of some other aspect of bowel 

## training that they are unable to articulate. 

## In most cases, hiding or playing with stool, or resistance to bowel training, is a normal part of early childhood that will 

## soon pass if you do not respond to it in an overemotional way. Instead, calmly ask your child why he is behaving in this 

## way, firmly remind him of the rules about where stool goes, and work to come up with a solution to his problem— 

## preferably with his help. You may find that your child is more willing to deposit his stool in the potty if he is then 

## allowed to transfer it to the toilet and flush it himself. You may decide that it is necessary to monitor your child’s potty 

## use until his interest in playing with his stools has passed. 

## In many cases, when your child’s health or other important considerations are not at stake, you may find that the best 

## solution is to simply wait until your child matures. If so, you may find that what at first seemed an enormous gap 

## between bladder and bowel training actually turned out to be no more than three or four weeks. 

## While nighttime bowel control occurs quite early and naturally in most children, bladder control usually occurs 

## much later—frequently months or even years after daytime training is complete—and requires conscious effort. 

## Forty percent of children in this country continue to wet the bed while sleeping after they have been fully day-trained. 

## Bedwetting continues to be quite common through age five, and it usually does not require medical intervention until 

## age eight to ten. Many children under age six are not physiologically capable of remaining dry at night, since their 

## bladders have not sufficiently matured and their bodies may not yet consistently wake them from sleep when it’s time 

## to urinate. Nearly every child will experience at least a few nighttime bedwettings before the toilet-training process is 

## truly complete. 

## Since conflicts over such mishaps can easily spill over to cause resistance during the day, it is usually best to downplay 

## night training through the toddler and even perhaps the preschool years. If your child is capable of consistently 

## waking up to use the bathroom even at age two or three, count yourself lucky and allow him to do so. If accidents 

## occur frequently, try keeping him in training pants or even a diaper at night for as long as he feels comfortable in 

## them, and respond calmly to any accidents that occur.
