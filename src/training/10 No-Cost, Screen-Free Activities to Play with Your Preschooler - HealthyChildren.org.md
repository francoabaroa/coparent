# 10 No-Cost, Screen-Free Activities to Play with Your 

# Preschooler 

## By: Suanne Kowal-Connelly, MD, FAAP 

## Most parents want to provide more for their children 

## than their parents were able to do for them. But, have 

## you ever noticed how kids tend to have fun with things 

## as simple as a cardboard box? It's true. 

## Getting back to basics 

## The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) report 

## (http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/129/1/e2 

## 04.full) on the importance of play explains that 

## inexpensive toys such as blocks, balls, jump ropes and 

## buckets are often the best kind for kids. In fact, they're more effective in allowing children to be imaginative and 

## creative than more expensive toys that may be out of reach for many parents. 

## So, why not take that cardboard box and play with them? More than any material gift, YOU are the best toy your 

## child will ever receive! 

## Not just kids' stuff 

## While it may be hard to relax and give yourself over to play, view this time with your child as an adventure. You are not 

## only promoting the many benefits of play (/English/ages-stages/toddler/fitness/Pages/Young-Children-Learn-A-Lot

## When-They-Play.aspx), but also getting to know your child better and strengthening the parent-child bond. For 

## starters, your role can actually be quite minimal and the play you undertake can be almost any activity. 

## Here are a dozen old-school play ideas that your preschooler will adore. 

## Bonus: You don't need much time or expensive lessons or toys to participate in any of the activities listed! 

## 1. Duck, Duck, Goose: Everyone sits in a circle. One child is "It" and goes around the circle tapping everyone on the 

## head and saying, "Duck." At this child's discretion, he or she taps someone and calls out "Goose." At the moment, 

## the child tapped must jump up and chase the child who was "It" around the circle of kids. If the child who was "It" 

## makes it around the circle and sits down, then he or she is "safe." If tagged by the "Goose," then he or she is out. 

## Either way, the Goose is now "It" and the game resumes. Eventually, only two children are left. The last child left 

## without being tagged wins. 

## 2. London Bridge is Falling Down: Two children form a bridge by joining hands across from each other. As 

## everyone sings the nursery rhyme, all the children pass under the up stretched arms. When the song ends, the 

## arms are dropped around the child passing through at the time. Then, the song changes to, "Take the key and lock 

## him up." Those joining hands can start rocking arms back and forth. Preschoolers delight in being "locked up" 

## and swayed to and fro. 

## 3. Limbo: Bring a broom stick outside and ask two older children or adults hold the ends. Have the children go 

## under the stick without touching it. If the stick is touched, then that child is out. After everyone has had a turn, 

## the stick can be gradually lowered in increments. This can be done to music, too, if available. 

## 4. Egg Races: Make some hard boiled eggs and bring them outside with some tablespoons. Have fun telling your 

## preschooler where they have to walk, run, jump, etc., while balancing the egg on the spoon. This promotes 

## balance and dexterity. 


#### 5. Simon Says: This is one of the most popular games for young children to play. It encourages good listening skills 

### and focus. You are Simon. Stand facing your children and give orders, such as "Simon says to touch your nose" or 

### "Simon says to do a jumping jack." As you call out each order, the children must do whatever you do, as long as 

### you have said, "Simon Says." If you just say, "Do this," whoever follows the action that you now do, is out. The last 

#### child standing wins. 

#### 6. Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes: You sing the tune and control the pace. Children have to touch the body part 

#### being mentioned, as it is mentioned. You can speed up the pace of the tune, and your child has to move faster and 

#### faster to keep up. It can get pretty funny as everyone tries to touch their knees and toes as fast as possible. 

#### 7. Nature walks: You can turn literally any walk outside into a nature walk—even a walk around the block. Observe 

### the weather, animals, bugs, and plants. You might say, "Look at those big clouds," or "Touch this grass. It is still wet 

### from yesterday's rain." Preschoolers especially love exploring and are sure to have plenty of questions for you 

#### along the way! 

#### 8. Follow the Leader: Move all around doing different movements. Everyone has to do what you do. Simple. Great. 

#### Fun! 

#### 9. Tag: You can be "It" for starters. Everyone tries to catch you and tag you. If you are tagged, then that child gets to 

#### be "It." Some designated spots can be considered "safe," like all the trees, or park benches, etc. This is a great 

#### excuse to just run around! 

### 10. Run Around: You can be "It" and call out things for everyone to do. For example, "Run from this tree to that tree," 

### or "Hop on one foot from this bench to that tree." There are endless suggestions—you will probably run out of 

#### ideas before your preschooler gets bored! 

## Remember 

#### While you may find many opportunities to capitalize on "teachable moments" during these activities, the key is to do 

#### what comes naturally to you as a parent. Playing together shouldn't be a chore or something you feel pressure to do. 

#### Enjoy the time you spend with your child. It will pass all too soon!
