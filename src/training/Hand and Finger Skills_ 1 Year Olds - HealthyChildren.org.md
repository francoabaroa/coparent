# Hand and Finger Skills: 1 Year Olds 

## Given all the large motor skills your one-year-old is mastering, it’s easy to overlook the more 

## subtle changes in her ability to use her hands, both alone and in coordination with her eyes. 

## These developments will allow her much more control and precision as she examines objects 

## and tries new movements. They also will greatly expand her ability to explore and learn about the 

## world around her. 

## At twelve months, it’s still a challenge for her to pick up very small objects between her thumb 

## and forefinger, but by the middle of her second year, this task will be simple. Watch how she’ll 

## manipulate small objects at will, exploring all the ways they can be combined and changed. Some 

## of her favorite games might include: 

## Building towers of up to four blocks, then knocking them down 

## Covering and uncovering boxes or other containers 

## Picking up balls or other objects in motion 

## Turning knobs and pages 

## Putting round pegs into holes 

## Scribbling and painting 

## These activities not only will help her develop hand skills but also will teach her spatial concepts, such as “in,” “on,” 

## “under,” and “around.” As she nears two years and her physical coordination improves, she’ll be able to try more 

## complex games, such as: 

## Folding paper (if you show her how) 

## Putting large square pegs into matching holes (which is more difficult than it is with round pegs, because it 

## involves matching angles) 

## Stacking up to five or six blocks 

## Taking toys apart and putting them back together 

## Making shapes from clay 

## By her second birthday, your toddler may demonstrate a clear tendency toward rightor left-handedness. However, 

## many children don’t show this preference for several years. Other children are ambidextrous, being able to use both 

## hands equally well. They may never establish a clear preference. There’s no reason to pressure your toddler to use 

## one hand over the other or to rush the natural process that leads her to this preference.
