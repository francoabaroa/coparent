# Is Homemade Baby Formula Safe? 

## By: Steven A. Abrams, MD, FAAP 

## Infants need a specific balance of nutrients—not too much or too 

## little of anything—to grow and be healthy. Human breastmilk 

## contains everything in exactly the right amounts, and infant 

## formula (/English/ages-stages/baby/formula

## feeding/Pages/default.aspx) can provide excellent nutrition when 

## families can't or choose not to breastfeed. But, keep in mind: 

## It's important for your baby's health to stick with products that 

## meet federal standards, prepared according to directions on 

## the label. 

## Risks of homemade baby formula recipes 

## Although recipes for homemade formulas circulating on the internet may seem healthy, less expensive or an answer 

## to the baby formula shortage (/English/tips-tools/ask-the-pediatrician/Pages/are-there-shortages-of-infant-formula

## due-to-COVID-19.aspx), they are risky. Homemade formula may not be safe or meet your baby's nutritional needs. The 

## U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) reports (https://www.fda.gov/food/alerts-advisories-safety-information/fda

## advises-parents-and-caregivers-not-make-or-feed-homemade-infant-formula-infants)that some babies fed 

## homemade formula have been hospitalized for hypocalcemia (low calcium), for example. 

## Some formula-feeding tips from the American Academy of 

## Pediatrics: 

## If you feed your baby formula, make sure to always: 

## Choose a formula product that has been reviewed by and meets FDA (https://www.fda.gov/food/people-risk

## foodborne-illness/questions-answers-consumers-concerning-infant-formula) minimum nutritional and safety 

## requirements 

## Prepare it according to directions on the label, unless you are given different instructions by your pediatrician 

## because of a special medical need your baby has. 

## What's important NOT to do: 

## Do not make a homemade formula from ingredients at the store, such as powdered cow milk or raw milk and 

## sugar. 

## Do not feed your infant under 1 year old cow milk or other milk substitutes (/English/healthy

## living/nutrition/Pages/Milk-Allergy-Foods-and-Ingredients-to-Avoid.aspx) from the dairy section of the 

## grocery store, such as almond or soy beverages (sometimes labeled as milk). 

## Do not use imported formulas from other countries that are not reviewed by the FDA. 

## Do not water down formulas by adding more water when mixing powdered formula or adding extra water to 

## ready-to-serve, non-concentrated liquid formula. 


## Why can't I make my own formula or use regular milk or milk 

## substitutes from the dairy aisle? 

### Although feeding babies regular milk or making homemade formula was common decades ago, it is not a safe or 

### recommended practice. In the United States, laws and other government rules make sure that all infant formula sold 

### in stores meets very strict rules about their ingredients, to make sure it supports healthy growth and development. 

### The FDA also oversees how approved formulas are made and stored. The government inspects both the formulas and 

### the manufacturing facilities regularly to be sure the rules are followed to avoid contamination and spoilage. 

### Formula mixtures made from online or other resources may not have vital components, such as enough iron or 

### vitamins for a baby. Or, they may have too much salt or other nutrients that your baby's kidneys and liver cannot 

### handle in large amounts. 

### In addition, regular dairy products like cow milk or alternatives such as soy, hemp, or almond milk are not designed 

### with the right amount of very important nutrition sources including protein, iron, calcium, and vitamins that a baby 

### needs. Even if it seems like they have enough from the label, the chemical forms of the nutrition may not be easily 

### absorbed by the baby’s body. Or, certain ingredients may affect each other (such as calcium and phosphorus) in ways 

### that is not ideal for things like bone growth. 

## Why are a baby's nutritional needs so specific? 

### The first year of life is a key time for your baby's brain and body to grow. If your baby doesn't get enough of the 

### important parts of infant formula—even for a few days or weeks—they can suffer long-term effects on their abilities 

### grow strong and do well in school. Lack of these nutrients can lead to severe health problems and even death. 

### Homemade formulas may also lead to risks of contamination, causing infections (/English/health

### issues/conditions/infections/Pages/default.aspx) or may even cause serious problems with high or low levels of 

### minerals like calcium or electrolytes such as sodium. 

## The chemicals on the infant formula label seem scary. How do I know 

## these are safe for my baby? 

### The label lists the names for specific chemical forms of ingredients like calcium and iron. These are forms considered 

### safe to feed a baby. Every formula that is reviewed by the FDA has been shown to lead to good infant growth. 

## Is it OK to buy formulas online that are imported from other 

## countries and supposedly better for babies? 

### No. These formulas have not gone through FDA review and are not always safely shipped or stored correctly. They are 

### often very expensive and do not offer any benefits for babies that have been shown in research. Despite what you 

### might read or see online, there is no scientific evidence that imported formulas are better for babies than what is on 

### your grocery shelf in the formula aisle. 

## Can I stretch the formula by adding a bit more water than the 

## instructions say? 

### No. Although this might seem like a harmless way to help save money, FDA-approved infant formula is designed for 

### just the correct amount of nutrition as described by the label. Adding extra water (/English/ages

### stages/baby/formula-feeding/Pages/How-to-Safely-Prepare-Formula-with-Water.aspx)decreases and dilutes the 

### nutrients and may cause serious growth problems or imbalances in vital nutrients like salt that can lead to serious 

### health problems. 

## Can you use toddler formula for babies under 12 months old? 

### No, this is not a good idea, because the nutritional needs of a small infant is not the same as it is for a toddler. Also, 

### toddler formula doesn't have to be FDA reviewed like infant formulas is. Look at the label on the formula and make 

### sure it says that it is designed for infants. If you have any questions, ask your pharmacist or pediatrician to help you 

### make sure that you are choosing the best formula for your baby.
