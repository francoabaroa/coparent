# Finding a Sitter: Tips for Parents 

## If you are looking for an occasional babysitter, you 

## might decide to hire a responsible adolescent from the 

## neighborhood. Typically, this may be a teenager who is 

## looking to make some spending money. Here are tips to 

## keep in mind. 

## Teenage babysitters: advantages 

## & disadvantages 

## There is an advantage to having young people as 

## babysitters, since they are generally energetic, playful, 

## fun-loving and entertaining for your children. The 

## disadvantage is that they may be less strict than you are with discipline, and they may not be experienced in handling 

## problem situations. 

## If your child is close to 12 years old, you will need someone considerably older to babysit. A teenager only one or two 

## years older is not likely to have much authority. Be sure to speak with the parents of any teenager you are considering 

## hiring, to get a sense of how they handle responsibility. It is also a good idea to check with other families who have 

## used the teenager for babysitting. 

## A good strategy is to develop a list of two or three sitters who know your child and can be called upon if your regular 

## sitter is busy or ill. Make sure they all understand the rules that apply to sitting at your home regarding: 

## Media use (/English/fmp/Pages/MediaPlan.aspx) such as TV watching, internet usage and texting 

## Substance use like smoking (/English/health-issues/conditions/tobacco/Pages/Dangers-of-Secondhand

## Smoke.aspx) or drinking (/English/ages-stages/teen/substance-abuse/Pages/Why-to-Have-the-Alcohol-Talk

## Early.aspx) 

## Taking your child outside (/English/safety-prevention/on-the-go/Pages/default.aspx) 

## If you need a sitter on a regular basis 

## If you need a sitter on a more regular basis, you may need to employ an older person. Word of mouth, online agencies 

## (including background checks) and local colleges are a few ideas to recruit people. 

## Qualities to look for in a sitter 

## In general, the sitter you choose should be mature, reliable and friendly with children. They should be someone with 

## whom your child enjoys spending time. As your child gets older, they should have some say in your selection of 

## caretakers. Kids are very smart and have great intuition about people; respect their opinion. 

## Interviewing a babysitter 

## Interview applicants thoroughly to get a sense of their reliability and competence. 

## Questions to ask: 

## Ask them about other positions they have held 

## The ages of children they have cared for 

## What their responsibilities included 


### How they would handle various situations (such as your child not wanting to do homework) 

### Activities they enjoy doing with children 

### If you think reading or singing to your child is important, look for a babysitter who enjoys these activities. Explain fully 

### your expectations—for example, will the child care involve housecleaning? Ask for and carefully check references. 

## Before your hire a sitter 

### If one person stands out among those you've interviewed, have them come for a "visit" while you are home. 

### Introduce them to your child, and pay them for an hour of child care while you are home as well. 

### Evaluate this first encounter in helping you determine if the person is a good fit for your family. 

### Later, ask your child about the sitter, and be sensitive to their comments. 

## How much to pay your babysitter 

### The hourly rate for babysitting varies from community to community. In general, pay should increase with 

### responsibility and with the competence of the babysitter. Caring for multiple children or adding household chores to 

### child care merits a higher hourly rate. In the weeks and months ahead, monitor your sitter and how they get along 

### with your child. Give advice and suggestions, and reinforce their positive qualities and strengths. 

## Au pairs 

### Some families prefer to hire an "au pair." Typically, this is a college-age person from another country who agrees to live 

### and work in the United States for a specified period of time (usually one year). While an au pair can be expensive, they 

### can bring cultural richness into your family. Recognize, however, that many of these individuals also need to be given 

### support and assistance in adjusting to the United States. To find an au pair, use an agency that specializes in these 

### placements. 

## Arrangements with neighbors, family & friends 

### Some families develop cooperative arrangements with neighbors or family friends who also have children. The 

### families take turns providing child care for one another. Even in these cases, be sure you are clear about the rules you 

### expect to be applied to your children. It is also helpful to keep track of how much child care each family is providing, 

### so no family feels that the exchange of service is out of balance. 

## Emergency numbers 

### No matter what kind of sitter you select, make sure that the person with whom you leave your child has a list of all 

### emergency phone numbers, including where you can be reached, and the names and numbers of trusted neighbors, 

### relatives, and your child's pediatrician. Make sure to have 911 and the national poison control center number (800

### 222-1222) displayed on or near the phone at all times, or ask them add these numbers to their contacts.

## What if your child doesn't like the sitter? 

### What should you do if your child challenges the sitter's authority? First, find out exactly what happened, talking to 

### both the child and the sitter. In many circumstances, it will be appropriate to stand behind the sitter; a united front 

### aids the sitter's role as an authority figure. However, if your child expresses a dislike for a sitter, or protests when 

### hearing who is going to sit, take your child's concerns seriously. Explore what the problem is, and remember that with 

### regard to child care, your child's safety and well-being are top priority.
