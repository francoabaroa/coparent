# Toilet Training: Which Method is Best? 

## Just as everyone has a different opinion about when it’s best to begin toilet training, so every 

## parent you know is likely to use or recommend a different training method. 

## You may have heard that demonstrating toilet use for your child is a good way to help him learn 

## through imitation. A friend may have told you that all she had to do with her son was read him a 

## book about potty use and talk it over with him. Many parents recommend talking with their 

## children about toilet use and then asking every two hours, “Do you need to go?” Some feel that 

## rewarding a child with gold stars on a chart or a small treat is the most effective method. Timing 

## is also a factor, as some parents prefer a brief, concentrated approach (perhaps even taking time 

## off from work to deliver two weeks of “immersion training”), while others feel that their children are less pressured 

## when allowed to adjust to potty use gradually over many months. 

## Any of these techniques may work well with your child. But keep in mind that it is not necessary to choose a single 

## method—in fact, your child will benefit from a combination of verbal, physical, social, and other forms of training no 

## matter what his age. 

## Accepting and adjusting to your child’s personal style can make toilet training a much less stressful experience than 

## you may have expected. You may also find yourself getting to know your child in a way you didn’t before— 

## appreciating his special qualities, becoming familiar with his emerging interests, and respecting him as a unique, 

## interesting individual.
