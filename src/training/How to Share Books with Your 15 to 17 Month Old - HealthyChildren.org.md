# How to Share Books with Your 15 to 17 Month Old 

## Even toddlers can enjoy books and learn from sharing books with you. Sharing books with your 

## toddler can help teach them to talk and them get ready to listen and learn in school. 

## Making Books A Part of Your Toddler’s Bedtime Routine 

## Set aside 5 to 10 minutes with the TV off for sharing books as part of your regular bedtime 

## routine. Regular bedtime routines started when children are young help prevent bedtime 

## struggles. Teaching young children how to fall asleep alone by putting them in bed awake helps 

## prevent future night wakings. 

## 15-17 Month Olds Can: 

## Choose a book to share. 

## Look at favorite pictures and make their own sounds for some of them. 

## Point to 1 or 2 animals and make that animal’s sound. 

## Pay attention to a book for a few minutes at a time. 

## Laugh, squeal and jabber while enjoying a favorite book with you. 

## What Parents Can Do: 

## Find a quiet, comfortable place for book sharing. 

## Name and say a few words about the pictures your child is pointing to orlooking at. 

## Imitate the sound or words your child says while looking at a picture. Then add a few more words like: “ Yes, eyes. 

## The girl has pretty eyes.” 

## Make up games, while looking at pictures, like: “ Where’s the girl’s nose? Where’s Mommy’s nose? Where’s 

## your nose?” 

## Name and then demonstrate actions in a book, such as “ Laughing. Look at the boy laughing.” Then laugh with 

## your child!
