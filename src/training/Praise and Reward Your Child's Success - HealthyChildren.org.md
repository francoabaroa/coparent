# Praise and Reward Your Child's Success 

## “My daughter, Tara, used her potty the very first day we brought it home,” reports her mother, Anita. “I thought we had 

## it made as far as toilet training went—but then she refused to go near the potty for the next two weeks. I already had 

## her in underwear, so I spent the entire two weeks cleaning up after her accidents. That wasn’t exactly what I’d 

## planned.” 

## Your child’s mastery of the potty, as with other developmental tasks, is a gradual progression, beginning with not being 

## able to eliminate, through being able to eliminate but not consistently, to total mastery. It should not come as a 

## surprise when initial successes on the potty are followed by setbacks or regression. While success on the potty is the 

## most effective reinforcing teaching tool available, the time it takes for this lesson to sink in varies widely. 

## Some children adjust to potty use almost immediately and continue to use the potty with few accidents. Most, 

## however, repeat their successes only sporadically for the first few days, weeks, or even months, gradually increasing 

## potty use as they enjoy the parental praise and feelings of independence that accompany it. 

## After your child has successfully used the potty several times at your suggestion, try hanging back a bit to see if she 

## will respond to the urge to use the potty on her own. It’s all right to verbally prompt her occasionally—particularly at 

## times when she usually needs to eliminate or if her behavior indicates she needs to go (dancing around, clutching her 

## genital area, squatting). But don’t constantly ask if she has to go to the bathroom, since such behavior will rob her of 

## her sense of control and cause her to resist. 

## When a mistake happens, treat it lightly and try not to get upset. Focus instead on keeping her meals and naps on a 

## regular schedule, asking her after each naptime and meal if she needs to go, and feeding her plenty of fruits, other 

## foods high in fiber, and liquids. This will make her body’s urges more predictable and she will then be more likely to 

## respond to them. 

## When your child does respond to her urge by going to the potty, managing her clothes, and successfully eliminating, 

## continue to praise her every time. Again, a treat in exchange for each potty use may motivate her to keep trying, as 

## long as the treat is not so big that it distracts from the act itself. 

## Most parents find that adding potty use to a list of chores or achievements (such as laying out the napkins for dinner, 

## feeding the fish, or brushing her teeth) and letting the child add a star or sticker next to each chore accomplished 

## enhances her feelings of pride while placing toilet training in the proper context of just another life skill that must be 

## mastered.
