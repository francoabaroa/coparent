# Milestones Matter: 10 to Watch for by Age 5 

## Birth through age five is an exciting time to watch your child grow 

## and learn to do many new things, like smiling, talking, walking and 

## making friends, for the first time. 

## While most children meet developmental milestones 

## (https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/actearly/milestones-app.html) 

## around a certain age, some may take longer to reach them. If you 

## ever have any questions about your child's development, it is always 

## good to talk to your pediatrician. Trust your instincts—you know 

## your child best! 

## 10 Physical, Social, Emotional & 

## Cognitive Milestones to Watch for as Your Child Grows: 

## By 2 months: Tries to look at his or her parent and pays attention to faces. 

## By 4 months: Copies facial movements, such as smiling or frowning, and responds to affection. 

## By 6 months: Likes to look at himself or herself in the mirror and brings objects to mouth. 

## By 9 months: Has favorite toys and picks up small items between the thumb and forefinger. 

## Around 12 months: Puts out arm or leg to help with dressing and follows simple directions. 

## At 18 months: Explores alone if a parent is nearby and points to a body part when asked. 

## By 2 years: Gets excited to see other children and begins sorting shapes and colors. 

## By 3 years: Is able to dress himself or herself and completes puzzles with three or four pieces. 

## By 4 years: Is able to tell the difference between real and make-believe and predicts what is going to happen next 

## in a book. 

## By 5 years: Wants to be like his or her friends and is able to draw a person with six body parts. 

## Next Steps: Track Your Child's Development 

## You can celebrate and easily track your child's development with these free milestone checklists 

## (http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/actearly/pdf/checklists/all_checklists.pdf) from the Center for Diseases Control and 

## Prevention (CDC). Take the completed checklist to your child's next well-child visit (/English/family-life/health

## management/Pages/Well-Child-Care-A-Check-Up-for-Success.aspx) at the pediatrician. You can share all the 

## milestones your child is reaching and any concerns you may have. 

## If you or your pediatrician thinks there may be a delay (/English/ages-stages/toddler/Pages/Assessing

## Developmental-Delays.aspx), ask for a referral to a medical, school, or developmental specialist (/English/family

## life/health-management/pediatric-specialists/Pages/default.aspx). Be sure to follow through on scheduling and 

## attending appointments with any specialists. They will be able to do a more complete evaluation on your child. They 

## will also work with your pediatrician to decide on the next steps to take to help your child reach his or her full 

## potential.

## Developmental Screening: Recommendation from the AAP 

### The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that children receive screening for development at 9, 18, 

### and 24 or 30 months and for autism at 18 and 24 months (/English/health-issues/conditions/Autism/Pages/How

### Doctors-Screen-for-Autism.aspx). Screening also can be done whenever a parent or provider has a concern. 

### If you are not sure if your child has had a developmental screening, ask your pediatrician to screen your child or to 

### share results with you from the most recent screen. 

## Remember: 

### Celebrate developmental milestones performed by your child. 

### Act early by talking to your pediatrician about concerns. 

### You know your child best.
