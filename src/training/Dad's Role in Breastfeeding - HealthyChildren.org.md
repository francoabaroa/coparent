# Dad's Role in Breastfeeding 

## Let’s say you and mom have talked about it and decided to go with breastfeeding (/english/ages

## stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/default.aspx). There are tons of things you can do to help, 

## beginning even before the baby is born. While breastfeeding is instinctive, there can be a lot to 

## learn to make sure it goes as well as possible. Many hospitals, obstetricians, pediatricians 

## (/English/ages-stages/prenatal/decisions-to-make/Pages/Finding-a-Pediatrician.aspx), and 

## freestanding lactation centers offer breastfeeding classes, which they encourage expectant 

## fathers to attend. The more you know about nursing, the more helpful you can be when the time 

## comes. 

## Successful nursing depends on a host of factors, many of which you 

## can help with. 

## Positioning is key. Mom may need a pillow or help propping up to get baby lined up just right. At that moment 

## she’s probably not in the best position to jump up and grab a pillow for support from across the room—you’re on 

## it! 

## Quench her thirst. In addition to all the other things prolactin does, it often causes mom to feel intensely thirsty 

## just as her milk is really starting to flow. Does she have a glass of cold water? You know what to do. 

## Be a hero. Nursing goes best when mom is relaxed and feeling happy about her baby. Can you adjust the 

## lighting? Put on some music? Rub her back? These are all opportunities to be a hero. 

## Gastrocolic reflex 

## If you really want to earn your cape, you’ll remember the gastrocolic reflex (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Babys

## First-Days-Bowel-Movements-and-Urination.aspx). This is the medical term for the way the body makes room for 

## incoming food by eliminating waste. In other words, it’s not your imagination that your baby poops every time she 

## nurses. Step in to handle this issue regularly and you can guarantee mom will be bragging about you to anyone who 

## will listen. Seriously, this is the stuff women talk about—just run with it. 

## Listening 

## Listening, of course, is an especially important way you can help. Nursing may be natural, but it can also be quite 

## frustrating and uncomfortable, especially at first (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/pages/Settling-In-The

## First-Few-Weeks-of-Breastfeeding.aspx). Mom’s nipples may crack and bleed; her breasts can become uncomfortably 

## engorged or even infected. You can help here, too, bringing her ointment or preparing warm compresses. But at times 

## it’s even more important that you just listen and offer sympathy. Your support may literally make the difference in 

## helping mom overcome the challenges of nursing.
