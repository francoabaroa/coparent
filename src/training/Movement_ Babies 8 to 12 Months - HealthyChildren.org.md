# Movement: Babies 8 to 12 Months 

## Once babies reach about 8 months of age, they are 

## starting to become a lot more mobile. 

## Here are some of the movement milestones you can 

## expect to see your baby working on at this age. 

## Sitting up without support 

## By this age, your baby probably will be sitting without 

## support. Although she may topple from time to time, 

## she'll usually catch herself with her arms. As the 

## muscles in her trunk strengthen, she'll also start 

## leaning over to reach objects. 

## Eventually she'll figure out how to roll onto her stomach and get back up to a sitting position. If she is not sitting by 

## herself by nine months, let your pediatrician know. 

## Flipping over 

## When lying on a flat surface, your baby is now in constant motion. When on her stomach, she'll arch her neck to look 

## around, and when on her back, she'll grab her feet (or anything else nearby) and pull them to her mouth. She won't be 

## content to stay on her back. She can turn over at will now and flip without a moment's notice. This can be dangerous 

## during diaper changes, so you may want to retire her changing table, using instead the floor or bed, from which she's 

## less likely to fall. Never leave her alone for an instant at any time. 

## Crawling, scooting & slithering 

## ll this activity strengthens muscles for crawling, a skill usually mastered between seven and ten months. For a while 

## she may rock on her hands and knees. Since her arm muscles are stronger than her legs, she may even push herself 

## backward. But with time and practice she'll discover she can propel herself forward across the room toward the target 

## of her choice. 

## A few children never crawl. Instead, they use alternative methods, such as scooting on their bottoms or slithering on 

## their stomachs. As long as your baby is coordinating each side of her body and using each arm and leg equally, there's 

## no cause for concern. The important thing is that she's able to explore her surroundings and is strengthening her 

## body in preparation for walking. If you feel your child is not moving normally, discuss your concern with the 

## pediatrician. 

## Encouraging your child to crawl 

## How can you encourage your child to crawl? Try presenting her with in triguing objects just beyond her reach. As she 

## becomes more agile, create miniature obstacle courses using pillows, boxes, and sofa cushions. Join in the game by 

## hiding behind one of the obstacles and surprising her with a “peekaboo!" Don't ever leave your baby unsupervised, 

## though. If she falls between pillows or under a box, she might not be able to get out. This is bound to frighten her, and 

## she could even smother. 

## Remember not to leave small objects on the floor, under the couch, or in any location where she can find them and put 

## them into her mouth. Things like balloon fragments, small button batteries (/English/safety-prevention/at

## home/Pages/Button-Battery-Injuries-in-Children-A-Growing-Risk.aspx), and coins are especially dangerous. 

## Stairs are another ready-made—but potentially dangerous—obstacle course. Although your baby needs to learn how 

## to go up and down stairs, you should not allow her to play on them alone during this time. If you have a staircase, she'll 

## probably head straight for it every chance she gets. Place sturdy gates at the top and bottom of your staircase. When 

## you're playing with her on stairs, encourage her to work her way down them backward, a skill she's likely to pick up 

## quickly. Even when she does, however, keep the stairs gated at all times.

### Although crawling changes dramatically how your baby sees and interacts with the world, don't expect her to be 

### content for long. She'll see everyone else walking, and that's what she'll want to do. In preparation, she'll pull herself to 

### a standing position every chance she gets—although when she first starts, she may not know how to get down. If she 

### cries for help, physically show her how to bend her knees to lower herself without falling. This may help and may save 

### you many trips to her room when she's standing in her crib and crying because she doesn't know how to sit down. 

## Standing, tottering & starting to walk 

### Once your baby feels secure standing, she'll try tentative steps while holding on for support. When your hands aren't 

### available, she'll cruise alongside furniture. Just make sure whatever she uses for support has no sharp edges and is 

### properly weighted or attached to the floor. 

### As her balance improves, she may let go occasionally before seeking support again when she feels herself totter. Her 

### first steps will be shaky. She may take only one before dropping, either in surprise or in relief. Soon, however, she'll 

### manage to keep herself up and moving until you catch her several steps later. As miraculous as it may seem, most 

### children advance from these first steps to confident walking within days. 

### Although you both will feel excited over this dramatic development, you'll also be unnerved at times, especially when 

### she stumbles and falls. Even if you took pains to provide a safe environment, it's almost impossible to avoid bumps and 

### bruises. Just be matter-of-fact about these mishaps. Offer a quick hug or a reassuring word and send her on her way 

### again. She won't be unduly upset by these falls if you're not. Also, don't be alarmed if she chooses to crawl at times after 

### she has started walking; babies use whatever is easiest and fastest! 

### At this stage, or even earlier, some parents use a baby walker (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/baby

### walkers-a-dangerous-choice.aspx). Contrary to what the name suggests, these devices do not help children learn to 

### walk. They actually eliminate the desire to walk. To make matters worse, they present a serious tipping hazard when 

### the child bumps into an obstacle, like a small toy or a throw rug. Children in walkers are also more likely to fall down 

### stairs and get into dangerous places otherwise beyond their reach. For these reasons, the American Academy of 

### Pediatrics strongly urges parents not to use baby walkers. 

### A stationary exercise saucer or activity center, with a rotating and bouncy seat but no wheels, is a better choice. You 

### may also consider a sturdy wagon or kiddie push car. Be sure it has a bar to push and is weighted so it won't tip when 

### she pulls herself up on it. 

## Your baby's first shoes 

### As your child begins to walk outside, she'll need shoes. They should be closed-toe, comfortable, and flexible, with 

### nonskid soles, and they should provide room to grow; sneakers are a great choice. Your child does not need wedges, 

### inserts, high backs, reinforced heels, special arches, or other features designed to shape and support feet. These have 

### no proven benefit for the average child and may actually make it harder to walk. Her feet will grow rapidly during 

### these months, and her shoes will have to keep pace. Her first pair of shoes will probably last two to three months, but 

### you should check the fit monthly during this formative period. 

### Many babies' first steps are taken around their first birthday, although it's normal for children to start walking earlier 

### or later. At first, your child will walk with feet wide apart to improve her shaky balance. During those initial days and 

### weeks, she may get going too fast and fall when she tries to stop. As she becomes more confident, she'll learn how to 

### stop and change directions. Before long, she'll be able to squat, pick something up, and stand again. When she reaches 

### this level, she'll get enormous pleasure from push-pull toys—the noisier the better.
