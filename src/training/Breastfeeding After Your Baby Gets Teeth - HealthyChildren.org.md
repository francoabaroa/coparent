# Breastfeeding After Your Baby Gets Teeth 

## Your baby's first tooth (/English/ages

## stages/baby/teething-tooth-care/Pages/Teething-4-to

## 7-Months.aspx) probably will appear after 6 months, 

## though some babies are born with one or more teeth. In 

## other cases, teeth don't appear until the child is almost a 

## year old. 

## Many nursing parents decide that it's time to stop 

## breastfeeding when they first notice a tooth. Usually, 

## this is because the baby has nipped the breast at the 

## end of a feeding session. Or, the nursing parent fears 

## they will be bitten soon. Yet many babies with teeth (or 

## those who are teething) never bite when breastfeeding. 

## How to prevent a breastfeeding baby from biting 

## If your baby has sprouted a tooth and you are concerned that they may nip you as a feeding ends: Keep your 

## finger ready to break the suction and remove your breast as soon as her rhythmic suckling stops (and before she 

## starts to drift off or feel playful). 

## If your baby has already bitten you while nursing: Say no firmly and then remove your baby from your breast. 

## Try to keep this action as bland and matter-of-fact as possible. Too much anger or even amusement may interest 

## them enough to make them want to repeat the experiment again. Once they realize that biting means no more 

## breast, they will learn to stifle the impulse. (Meanwhile, don't forget to offer your baby a one-piece teething ring 

## when they are not nursing.) 

## How to prevent baby-bottle tooth decay 

## Once your baby's teeth have begun to come in, keep in mind that even breastfeeding babies are sometimes 

## susceptible to baby-bottle tooth decay (BBTD) (/English/ages-stages/baby/teething-tooth-care/Pages/How-to-Prevent

## Tooth-Decay-in-Your-Baby.aspx). BBTD is a major cause of dental cavities in infants that can also cause serious damage 

## to permanent teeth later on. 

## Baby-bottle tooth decay results from teeth being coated in almost any liquid other than water for long periods. It 

## occurs most commonly among babies who are put to bed with a bottle of formula or juice. Breastfeeding infants who 

## fall asleep while nursing with unswallowed milk remaining in their mouths are also vulnerable to tooth decay. 

## Beyond the first year, dental caries—tooth decay—can occur in toddlers who receive sugary liquids in a bottle or who 

## are nursing and eating foods with sugar and carbohydrates. Make a point of removing your breast from your 

## baby's mouth once they have fallen asleep. 

## Did you know? 

## An actively nursing baby will not bite because their tongue covers their lower teeth. A baby who nips the breast 

## as they start to pull away near the end of a feeding can be taught to stop. Try not to let this minor challenge get in 

## the way of breastfeeding so early in your nursing relationship.

## Tips to promote dental health right from the start 

### Your pediatrician will check your baby's teeth as part of the well-child visits (/English/family-life/health

### management/Pages/Well-Child-Care-A-Check-Up-for-Success.aspx) during the first year of life and beyond. 

### To stimulate healthy gums: It is a good idea to wipe the gums at least once a day, beginning at birth, even before 

### any teeth have erupted in your child's mouth. 

### After teeth erupt: Wiping their gums and teeth with a piece of gauze or a damp cloth after feedings and before 

### bedtime will help maintain good oral hygiene. 

### Once your child has several teeth: Start using water and a soft-bristled, child-size toothbrush for daily cleaning 

### with a small smear of fluoridated toothpaste. Some fluoride is good for strong, healthy teeth that are resistant to 

### decay, but too much can cause dark discoloration of the teeth. 

### Your doctor or dentist may also apply a topical fluoride varnish (/English/healthy-living/oral

### health/Pages/Brushing-Up-on-Oral-Health-Never-Too-Early-to-Start.aspx) at office visits to protect your baby's 

### teeth. A first dental checkup is recommended by your baby's first birthday (/English/ages-stages/Your-Childs

### Checkups/Pages/Your-Checkup-Checklist-12-Months-Old.aspx).
