# Physical Appearance and Growth: 4 to 7 Months 

## Between four and seven months, your baby will continue to gain 

## approximately 1 to 1-1⁄4 pounds (0.45 to 0.56 kg) a month. By the 

## time she reaches her eight month birthday, she probably will weigh 

## about two and a half times what she did at birth. Her bones also will 

## continue to grow at a rapid rate. As a result, during these months 

## her length will increase by about 2 inches (5 cm) and her head 

## circumference by about 1 inch (2.5 cm). 

## Your Baby’s Rate of Growth 

## Your child’s specific weight and height are not as important as her 

## rate of growth (/English/family-life/health

## management/Pages/Growth-Charts-By-the-Numbers.aspx). Continue to plot her measurements (/English/ages

## stages/baby/Pages/Tracking-Your-Babys-Weight-and-Measurements.aspx) at regular intervals to make sure she 

## keeps growing at the same rate. 

## If you find that she’s beginning to follow a different curve or gaining weight or height unusually slowly, discuss it with your pediatrician 

## (/English/family-life/health-management/Pages/Visiting-The-Pediatrician-The-First-Year.aspx).
