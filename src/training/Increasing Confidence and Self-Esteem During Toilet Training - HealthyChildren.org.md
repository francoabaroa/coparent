# Increasing Confidence and Self-Esteem During Toilet 

# Training 

## Toilet training is an uneven process, but it is an inevitable one in nearly every child’s life. By three 

## to four years of age, most children have achieved daytime urine control and full bowel control 

## (both day and night). The ability to stay dry through the night will follow a bit later, with most 

## girls and more than 75 percent of boys fully mastering this ability by around age six. 

## Your child, too, will move more or less steadily from diapers to underwear, from potty to toilet, 

## and from daytime to full-time management of his elimination processes. Many parents find, in 

## fact, that once their child grasps the concept of one form of elimination, mastery in the other 

## areas follows with greater ease (yet still on its own schedule). Soon your child will announce 

## confidently in restaurants and airports that he needs to find a bathroom, will lead you by the hand to the restroom, and 

## will confidently use a toilet he’s never seen before. 

## In the meantime, your continued support and sensitivity to his needs will encourage his progress. As he moves from a 

## potty to the adult toilet at home, provide him with a stepstool if he needs it and a child-size toilet seat. (The age at 

## which this transition occurs will depend on your child’s interest, your needs, and environmental requirements such 

## as the need to use adult-style toilets more frequently outside the home.) 

## When he needs to use the toilet away from home, accompany and assist him, making sure that he follows the same 

## routine (wipe, flush, wash hands) he’s learned at home. Consider bringing his potty or a child’s toilet seat adapter 

## along on trips, as well as a change of clothing. It may also help to allow your child to observe you using the toilet in 

## these unfamiliar places, and talk to him about what a big boy he will be when he can do the same. Before he starts 

## school, make sure he can pull his pants up and down properly. 

## Such efforts to support your child will increase his confidence in bathroom use, but they will do much more than that. 

## They will let him know in many important ways how committed you are to helping him learn new skills and adjust to 

## new challenges. 

## By allowing him to develop at his own rate, withholding criticism or judgment when he fails, and offering praise when 

## he succeeds, you have shown him that he can set a goal for himself and achieve it. By continuing to teach him how to 

## manage his personal functions the way big kids and adults do, you are helping him achieve his greatest goal— 

## increased independence and self-mastery. 

## In many ways, toilet-training success is not only a demonstration of all that your child has learned in a few short years 

## of life, but also an indication of how he will overcome challenges and meet goals in the years to come.
