# Teething Necklaces and Beads: A Caution for Parents 

## When parents see their baby suffering, they just want a solution. 

## Teething necklaces and beads have become an increasing popular 

## alternative treatment to ease teething pain (/English/ages

## stages/baby/teething-tooth-care/Pages/Teething-Pain.aspx). But, 

## are they effective and safe? The answer is no. 

## The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released an official 

## warning 

## (https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/AlertsandNotices/uc 

## m628900.htm) in December 2018 after recieving reports of 

## children choking on beads that break off and an 18-month-old 

## being strangled to death by an amber necklace during a nap. 

## Teething Necklaces: Watch Out For Faulty Claims 

## Teething necklaces and bracelets are made of amber, wood, marble or silicone. They are marketed to relieve 

## teething pain and sometimes are used to provide sensory stimulation to people with attention-deficit/hyperactivity 

## disorder. 

## According to Dr. Andrew Weil, a world-renowned leader and pioneer in the field of integrative medicine, the use of 

## these necklaces is not supported by modern science. Retailers claim that when warmed by the baby's body 

## temperature, the amber releases a pain-relieving substance that is then absorbed through the skin into the 

## bloodstream. Additionally, promoters claim that they stimulate the thyroid gland (to control drooling) and improve 

## the ability of the immune system to reduce inflammation in the ears, throat, stomach and respiratory system. 

## However, there is currently no scientific research or evidence to back up these claims. 

## Why These Teething Necklaces and Beads are Choking and 

## Strangulation Hazards: 

## "The risk is two-fold — strangulation and choking (/English/health-issues/injuries-emergencies/Pages/Choking

## Prevention.aspx)," said pediatrician Natasha Burgert, MD, FAAP. It occurs when the necklaces are worn around a 

## child's neck, especially when unsupervised (such as while sleeping) or if the child were to break the necklace and 

## swallow the beads. However, those risks are not only for these teething necklaces. 

## The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) does not recommend that infants wear any jewelry. Suffocation is 

## the leading cause of death for children under a year old and among the top five causes of death for children 

## between the ages of 1 and 4. 

## Parents who choose to use these necklaces are advised to: 

## Always supervise your child when he or she is wearing the necklace or bracelet. 

## Have your child wear the necklace on a wrist or ankle and not around his or her neck. 

## Remember to remove the necklace or bracelet when your child is unattended, even if it is only for a short period 

## of time! 

## Remove the necklace or bracelet while your child is sleeping (day or night). 

## Consider using alternate forms of teething pain relief (see suggestions below). 

## Talk to your child's pediatrician if you have concerns or questions about your child's health.

## Safer Ways to Soothe a Teething Baby: 

#### There are many teething-pain relievers that can soothe your baby's sore gums safely. Here are a few worth trying: 

#### Chew toys. Plastic and rubber toys are great for soothing aching gums. 

#### Cold things. For help numbing and easing the ache and inflammation, try using damp washcloths that have been 

#### twisted and frozen (tie one end in a knot for better gnawing). Avoid teething rings that are frozen solid; they are 

#### too hard for children's mouths. 

#### Massage. A light, gentle rub or massage might give your little one a lot of relief. Remember to wash your hands, 

#### then massage the sore areas in your baby's mouth with your finger or knuckle. 

#### Medicine. When your baby is having a really tough time, ask your pediatrician about giving a dose of 

#### acetaminophen (Tylenol). Note: Numbing gels or creams that contain benzocaine are not recommended for 

#### infants.
