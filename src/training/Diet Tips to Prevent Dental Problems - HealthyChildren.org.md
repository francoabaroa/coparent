# Diet Tips to Prevent Dental Problems 

## A balanced diet, with plenty of calcium (/English/ages

## stages/teen/nutrition/Pages/Importance-of-Calcium.aspx) and 

## vitamin D (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Vitamin-D-On

## the-Double.aspx) to increase calcium absorption, should provide all 

## the nutrients necessary to build strong teeth and keep gums and 

## mouth tissues healthy. Young people can get adequate calcium 

## from 3 or 4 daily servings of dairy foods, as well as from many other 

## sources (eg, calcium-processed tofu, calcium-fortified orange juice, 

## green vegetables such as broccoli). 

## The Benefits of Fluoride 

## Fluoride reduces dental decay by making the enamel harder, reducing the ability of bacteria to produce acid that 

## erodes enamel, and by replacing minerals in the teeth after they have been lost. In areas where the natural fluoride 

## content of the water is low and water supplies are not fluoridated, or if your household uses bottled or reverse osmosis 

## filtered water, pediatricians and dentists may advise fluoride supplements, fluoride toothpaste, or fluoride treatments 

## to strengthen children’s tooth enamel against decay. Most bottled water does not contain adequate amounts of 

## fluoride. Home water treatment systems like reverse osmosis and distillation units remove much of the fluoride from 

## tap water. However, carbon or charcoal water filtration systems generally do not remove substantial amounts of 

## fluoride. 

## Too Much Fluoride & Fluorosis 

## One of the complications of too much fluoride is dental fluorosis. Fluorosis ranges from minor white lines that run 

## across the teeth to a chalky appearance of the teeth with brown staining. Fluorosis can be caused by prescribing 

## fluoride supplements (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Fluoride-Supplements.aspx)in 

## communities with fluoridated water, or young children (/english/ages

## stages/preschool/Pages/default.aspx)swallowing fluoridated toothpaste. To avoid this latter problem, children should 

## use no more than a smear of fluoridated toothpaste before age 2, if your child’s pediatrician or dentist suggests using 

## fluoridated toothpaste. For children older than age 2, use only a small pea-sized amount of fluoridated toothpaste. 

## Also, your pediatrician or pediatric dentist (/English/family-life/health-management/pediatric

## specialists/Pages/What-is-a-Pediatric-Dentist.aspx)will know the fluoride content of your local water and can advise 

## you if a supplement is necessary or excessive. 

## Damaging Sugars 

## All sugars promote the growth of mouth bacteria that produce acid and cause tooth decay (/English/ages

## stages/baby/teething-tooth-care/Pages/Preventing-Tooth-Decay.aspx). Unrefined sugars such as honey, maple syrup, 

## and molasses are just as damaging as refined white sugar in this respect. The worst offenders are the sugars in sticky 

## foods that cling to teeth, such as dried fruit leathers and candies. Sodas and sweetened juice drinks (/English/healthy

## living/nutrition/Pages/Where-We-Stand-Fruit-Juice.aspx)leave the teeth awash in sugar. Cereals 

## (/English/news/Pages/Low-Sugar-Cereals-Win-Nutrition-Contest-at-Breakfast.aspx) and other starchy foods, such as 

## popcorn, leave a residue that bacteria rapidly convert to sugar.
