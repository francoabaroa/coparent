# Introducing the Bottle 

## Once you have learned how to express your breast milk, you will need to teach your baby to drink 

## it from a bottle. Many mothers find that this works better if someone else offers the baby the 

## bottle at first, somewhere other than where he usually breastfeeds. (That way, he will have none of 

## the usual cues to start seeking out the breast.) Clearly, this is an excellent time to enlist the aid of 

## your partner or other loved one who has been eager to feed him, or perhaps to invite the baby’s 

## future caregiver to start establishing a feeding relationship with him. 

## During the first few attempts, have this person offer about ½ ounce of breast milk an hour or two 

## after a regular feeding, when your baby is alert and motivated to try this new feeding method but 

## not so hungry that he’s upset and frantic. The adult should take care to keep a calm and reassuring manner. A smiling 

## face and soothing voice will help your baby relax. It sometimes helps to drip a little familiar-tasting breast milk on the 

## baby’s lips or tongue at first to give him an idea of what you are doing. Then slowly and gently introduce the nipple 

## into his mouth. Your baby should be allowed to explore the nipple with his mouth, not have it forced past his gums. 

## Stop the attempt if he becomes frustrated or if more than ten minutes pass and he hasn’t fed. It’s better to end on a 

## positive note and try again the next day than to create an association between this new method of feeding and feelings 

## of frustration. 

## If after a few daily attempts he still refuses to drink from the container you’ve offered, try changing to a different kind 

## of nipple or from a bottle to a cup. (If your baby uses a pacifier, he may prefer a similar nipple for bottle-feeding. 

## Otherwise, you may have to experiment with several types of nipples until you find one he likes.) Some babies are 

## particular about which feeding method they’ll accept, but once they are introduced to one they like, they adjust easily. 

## Your baby may show a preference for a small medicine cup or a sippy cup rather than a bottle, even if he is very young. 

## Be aware of your baby’s cues and respond accordingly, but don’t give up on any one type of feeding device until you’ve 

## tried it for several days. 

## As your baby shows signs of accepting an alternative feeding method, start expressing more milk and occasionally 

## offering the bottle or cup when he acts hungry between feedings. Finally, offer him (or have another adult give him) an 

## occasional full, regular feeding with a cup or bottle at a time of day when eventually you expect to be absent. In this 

## way, you can create a daily pattern that will be familiar to your baby by the time you need to implement it.
