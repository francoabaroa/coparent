# Caring for a Premature Baby: What Parents Need to Know 

## Premature birth occurs in about 11 to 13 percent of 

## pregnancies in the US. 

## Almost 60 percent of twins, triplets, and other 

## multiple deliveries result in preterm births. 

## It is important to recognize that preterm deliveries, 

## even if late preterm, should never be done for the 

## convenience of the mother or obstetrician. Research 

## has shown that late preterm babies have significantly 

## greater risk for negative outcomes, and all efforts 

## should be made to have babies reach full term. See Let 

## Baby Set the Delivery Date: Wait until 39 Weeks if You 

## Can (/English/ages-stages/prenatal/delivery-beyond/Pages/Let-Baby-Set-the-Delivery-Date-Wait-until-39-Weeks-if

## You-Can.aspx). 

## Characteristics of Babies Born Premature 

## While the average full-term baby weighs about 7 pounds (3.17 kg) at birth, a premature newborn might weigh 5 

## pounds (2.26 kg) or even considerably less. But thanks to medical advances, children born after twenty-eight weeks of 

## pregnancy, and weighing more than 2 pounds 3 ounces (1 kg), have almost a full chance of survival; eight out of ten of 

## those born after the thirtieth week have minimal long-term health or developmental problems, while those preterm 

## babies born before twenty-eight weeks have more complications, and require intensive treatment and support in a 

## neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). 

## How Your Premature Baby Looks 

## The earlier your baby arrives, the smaller she will be, the larger her head will seem in relation to the rest of her 

## body, and the less fat she will have. 

## With so little fat, her skin will seem thinner and more transparent, allowing you actually to see the blood vessels 

## beneath it. She also may have fine hair, called lanugo, on her back and shoulders. 

## Her features will appear sharper and less rounded than they would at term, and she probably won't have any of 

## the white, cheesy vernix protecting her at birth, because it isn't produced until late in pregnancy. Don't worry, 

## however; in time she'll begin to look like a typical newborn. 

## Because she has no protective fat, your premature baby will get cold in normal room temperatures. For that 

## reason, she'll be placed immediately after birth in an incubator (often called an isolette) or under a special 

## heating device called a radiant warmer. Here the temperature can be adjusted to keep her warm. 

## After a quick examination in the delivery room, she'll probably be moved to the NICU. 

## How Your Premature Baby Acts 

## You also may notice that your premature baby will cry only softly, if at all, and may have trouble breathing. This is 

## because her respiratory system is still immature. 

## If she's more than two months early, her breathing difficulties can cause serious health problems, because the 

## other immature organs in her body may not get enough oxygen. To make sure this doesn't happen, doctors will 

## keep her under close observation, watching her breathing and heart rate with equipment called a cardio

## respiratory monitor. 


#### If she needs help breathing, she may be given extra oxygen, or special equipment such as a ventilator; or another 

#### breathing assistance technique called CPAP (continued positive airway pressure) may be used temporarily to 

#### support her breathing. 

## Preemie Parents: How to Cope with the Stress 

#### As important as this care is for your baby's survival, her move to the special-care nursery may be wrenching for you. 

#### On top of all the worry about her health, you may miss the experience of holding, breastfeeding, and bonding with 

#### her right after delivery. You won't be able to hold or touch her whenever you want, and you can't have her with you in 

#### your room. 

#### To deal with the stress of this experience, ask to see your baby as soon as possible after delivery, and become as 

### active as you can in caring for her. See How You Can Participate in the Care of Your Baby in the NICU (/English/ages

### stages/baby/preemie/Pages/How-You-Can-Participate-in-the-Care-of-Your-Baby-in-the-NICU.aspx). 

#### Spend as much time with her in the special-care nursery as your condition—and hers—permit. Even if 

#### you can't hold her yet (until she's stable), touch her often. Many intensive care units allow parents to do skin-to

#### skin care for their babies once the infants don't require major support to their organ systems. 

#### You can also feed her as soon as your doctor says it's OK. The nurses will instruct you on either breast-or 

#### bottle-feeding techniques, whichever is appropriate for the baby's needs and your desires. 

#### Some premature babies may initially require fluids given intravenously or through a feeding tube 

#### that passes through the mouth or nose into the stomach. But your breast milk is the best possible 

#### nutrition, and provides antibodies and other substances which enhance her immune response and help 

#### her resist infection. 

#### In some cases, if it's too difficult for your premature baby to nurse at the breast, you can pump 

#### breast milk for feeding through a tube or bottle. Once you are able to start breastfeeding directly, your 

#### baby should nurse frequently to increase your milk supply. Even so, mothers of premature babies 

#### sometimes find it necessary to continue using a breast pump in addition to feeding frequently to maintain 

### a good milk supply. See Providing Breastmilk for Premature and Ill Newborns (/English/ages

### stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Providing-Breastmilk-for-Premature-and-Ill-Newborns.aspx) and Tips 

### for Freezing & Refrigerating Breast Milk (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Storing-and

### Preparing-Expressed-Breast-Milk.aspx). 

#### You may be ready to return home before your newborn is, which can be very difficult, but remember that 

#### your baby is in good hands, and you can visit her as often as you'd like. You can use your time away from 

#### the hospital to get some needed rest and prepare your home and family for your baby's homecoming, and 

#### read a book for parents on caring for preterm babies (http://shop.aap.org/Newborn-Intensive-Care-What

#### Every-Parent-Needs-to-Know-3rd-Edition-Paperback). Even after you've returned home, if you participate in 

#### your infant's recovery and have plenty of contact with her during this time, the better you'll feel about the 

#### situation and the easier it will be for you to care for her when she leaves the special care nursery. 

#### As soon as your doctor says it's OK, gently touch, hold, and cradle your newborn. 

#### Your own pediatrician may participate in, or at least will be informed about, your infant's immediate 

#### care. Because of this, he will be able to answer most of your questions. 

#### Your baby will be ready to come home (/English/ages-stages/baby/preemie/Pages/Going-Home-With-Your

#### Preemie.aspx) once she's breathing on her own, able to maintain her body temperature, able to be fed by breast or 

#### bottle, and gaining weight steadily.
