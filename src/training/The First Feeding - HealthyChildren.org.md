# The First Feeding 

## The minutes following childbirth are typically an exciting time for everyone involved. As you 

## recover from your physical experience of labor and delivery, you may feel overwhelmed by an 

## enormous number of new feelings, hopes, and uncertainties. Of course, this is also a time when 

## you want the professional treatment of your newborn to proceed according to your wishes. 

## Ideally, you will have informed your obstetrician and pediatrician ahead of time of your desire to 

## breastfeed. Your partner or birthing coach should remind your pediatrician and obstetrical or 

## newborn nurses that you do not want your baby to be given water, a pacifier, or supplemental 

## feedings without a valid medical reason. 

## Skin-to-skin 

## Ideally, you will want your baby placed on your abdomen moments after delivery. You will want to breastfeed within 

## an hour or so of giving birth to take advantage of your baby’s suckling instinct. When placed in skin-to-skin contact 

## with the mother, the alert, healthy infant is capable of latching on to the breast without specific assistance within the 

## first hour after birth. 

## Infants who are placed on their mother’s abdomen after birth and who attach to the breast within an hour have more 

## successful breastfeeding experiences than infants who do not attach early on. Milk let-down also occurs earlier in 

## mothers who breastfeed their infants soon after birth. In fact, babies who nurse early after delivery are more likely to 

## still be breastfeeding at two to four months of age than infants who start nursing more than two hours after birth. 

## Immediate breastfeeding also starts the process of establishing your future milk supply and helps your uterus 

## contract and return to its prepregnancy state, which decreases the chance of excessive bleeding after delivery. 

## Breastfeeding immediately is possible with most healthy births, when a baby needs little medical care beyond drying 

## off and keeping warm. Offering your breast to your infant at this time will help her take advantage of her natural 

## instincts to latch on and suckle. You should place your baby in skin-to-skin contact on your abdomen or chest, with 

## bare skin against bare skin. Have your baby wear nothing, except a diaper if you prefer. If the baby is cold, your 

## temperature will increase to bring the baby’s temperature up. This skin-to-skin placement will also allow the baby 

## direct access to the breast. 

## Attachment 

## This is not to say that your newborn will instantly know what to do. Some mothers find that their babies do not actively 

## suckle during the first few attempts but instead simply snuggle contentedly against the breast, tentatively lick the 

## nipple, or attach to the breast and suckle briefly but then stop and look around. Many others find that their babies 

## latch on right away and suckle as if they’ve been doing it for months. (Most babies have already been practicing by 

## sucking on their fingers or arms in the uterus.) 

## Whether or not your infant actually breastfeeds productively at this time is not critical. Rather, this is a time for the 

## two of you to start to get to know each other, for her to be introduced to the breast, and for her to begin to associate the 

## sight, smell, and feel of your breasts with the satiety of her hunger and thirst. She also learns that being held skin to 

## skin makes her feel warm, comfortable, and nurtured. 

## Good for Mom, too 

## This first feeding is important for you, too, in that it represents your first step in establishing a breastfeeding 

## relationship. No matter how well you have prepared ahead of time, your first real breastfeeding experience may feel a 

## little strange. Your baby’s tongue on your nipple or her firm grip on your breast may feel different from what you’d 

## imagined, or you may find that you are unsure whether you are holding her correctly or whether she’s truly latched 

## on. You may perceive help from nurses as intrusive or feel selfconscious trying to breastfeed in a room full of 

## strangers. All of these feelings are normal for a new mother.

### As in any partnership, you and your newborn will have to learn and adjust to each other’s style. As with any physical 

### skill, mastery will come with practice. For now it’s best to relax, enjoy this moment, and wait until you’ve both had 

### some rest before worrying about perfecting your technique. 

## If you need to wait 

### There are some situations in which immediate breastfeeding is not possible or advisable. If your baby is premature, ill, 

### in fragile condition, or if you are still struggling to recover from medication given for a cesarean section or any other 

### type of sedation, you may need to postpone nursing. If this is the case, there is still plenty of time to become 

### acquainted with your baby. As soon as possible after a difficult delivery, request help from the hospital staff so that 

### breastfeeding can go as smoothly as possible.
