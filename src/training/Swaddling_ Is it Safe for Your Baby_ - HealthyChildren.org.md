# Swaddling: Is it Safe for Your Baby? 

## By: Rachel Y. Moon, MD, FAAP & Danette Glassy, MD, FAAP 

## New parents often learn how to swaddle their infant 

## from the nurses in the hospital. A thin blanket wrapped 

## snuggly around your baby's body can resemble the 

## womb and help soothe your newborn. When done 

## correctly, swaddling can be an effective technique to 

## help calm infants and promote sleep (/English/ages

## stages/baby/sleep/Pages/default.aspx). 

## But if you plan to swaddle your infant at home, you need 

## to follow a few guidelines to make sure you are doing it 

## safely. 

## Back to sleep 

## To reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/Preventing-SIDS.aspx), 

## or SIDS, it's important to place your baby to sleep on their back–every time you put them to sleep. This may be even 

## more important if your baby is swaddled. Some studies have shown an increased risk of SIDS and unintentional 

## suffocation when babies are swaddled if they are placed on their stomach to sleep, or if they roll onto their stomach. If 

## babies are swaddled, they should be placed only on their back and monitored so they don't roll over. 

## When to stop swaddling 

## Stop swaddling as soon as your baby shows any signs of trying to roll over. Some babies start working on rolling as 

## early as 2 months of age, but every baby is different. There is no evidence with regard to SIDS risk related to the arms 

## swaddled in or out. 

## Know the risks 

## Parents should know that there are some risks to swaddling. Swaddling may decrease a baby's arousal, so that it's 

## harder for them to wake up. That is why swaddling can seem so attractive to new, sleep-deprived parents—the baby 

## sleeps longer and doesn't wake up as easily. But we know that decreased arousal can be a problem and may be one of 

## the main reasons that babies die of SIDS. 

## AAP safe sleep recommendations 

## The AAP recommends parents follow the safe sleep recommendations every time they place their baby to sleep for 

## naps or at nighttime: 

## Place your baby on their back to sleep on a firm, flat surface and monitor them to be sure they don't roll over 

## while swaddled. 

## What about wearable blankets or sleep sacks? 

## Infant sleep clothing, such as layers of clothing or a wearable blanket or sleep sack, is preferred over blankets and 

## other coverings to keep a baby warm. A safe sleep space (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/a-parents

## guide-to-safe-sleep.aspx) for infants should stay free of any loose bedding or soft objects. However, as with 

## regular blanket swaddling, the use of wearable blankets or sleep sacks that compress the arms, chest and body 

## should stop once a baby shows signs of starting to roll over. Sleep sacks that do not swaddle and allow the baby to 

## move freely can be used as long as you want. 


#### Do not have any loose blankets in your baby's crib (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/New-Crib

#### Standards-What-Parents-Need-to-Know.aspx). A loose blanket, including a swaddling blanket that comes 

#### unwrapped, could cover your baby's face and increase the risk of suffocation. 

#### Do not use weighted swaddles or weighted blankets, which can place too much pressure on a baby's chest and 

#### lungs. 

#### Use caution when buying products that claim to reduce the risk of SIDS. Wedges, positioners, special mattresses 

#### and specialized sleep surfaces have not been shown to reduce the risk of SIDS. 

#### Your baby is safest in their own crib or bassinet, not in your bed. 

#### Swaddling can increase the chance your baby will overheat, so avoid letting your baby get too hot. The baby could 

#### be too hot if you notice sweating, damp hair, flushed cheeks, heat rash and rapid breathing. 

#### Consider using a pacifier (/English/ages-stages/baby/crying-colic/Pages/Practical-Pacifier-Principles.aspx) for 

#### naps and bedtime. 

#### Place the crib in an area that is always smoke-free (/English/health

#### issues/conditions/tobacco/Pages/Importance-of-Smoke-Free-Homes-and-Cars.aspx).

### guide-to-safe-sleep.aspx) for more information and tips. 

## Keep hips loose 

#### Babies who are swaddled too tightly may develop a problem with their hips. Studies have found that straightening and 

#### tightly wrapping a baby's legs can lead to hip dislocation or hip dysplasia (/English/health

#### issues/conditions/orthopedic/Pages/Hip-Dysplasia.aspx). This is an abnormal formation of the hip joint where the top 

#### of the thigh bone is not held firmly in the socket of the hip. 

#### The Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America, with the AAP Section on Orthopaedics, promotes "hip-healthy 

#### swaddling" that allows the baby's legs to bend up and out. 

## How to swaddle correctly 

#### Use only a thin blanket for swaddling. 

#### To swaddle, spread the blanket out flat, with one corner folded down. 

#### Lay the baby face-up on the blanket, with their head above the folded corner. 

#### Straighten their left arm and wrap the left corner of the blanket over your baby's body, tucking it between their 

#### right arm and the right side of their body. 

#### Then tuck the right arm down, and fold the right corner of the blanket over her body and under their left side. 

#### Fold or twist the bottom of the blanket loosely and tuck it under one side of the baby. 

#### Make sure their hips can move and that the blanket is not too tight. You want to be able to get at least two or three 

#### fingers between the baby's chest and the swaddle 

## Swaddling in child care 

#### Some child care centers may have a policy against swaddling infants in their care. This is because of the increased 

#### risks of SIDS or suffocation (/English/family-life/work-play/Pages/A-Child-Care-Provider%27s-Guide-to-Safe

#### Sleep.aspx) if the baby rolls over while swaddled, in addition to the other risks of overheating and hip dysplasia. 

#### Compared to a private home, where one or two people are caring for an infant, a child care center usually has a 

#### number of caregivers who may have variations in their swaddling technique. This raises a concern because studies 

#### show babies who are not usually swaddled react differently when swaddled for the first time at this older age. They 

#### may have a harder time waking up, which increases their risk of SIDS. 

#### The difference in the advice for swaddling at home or the hospital nursery, versus in a child care center, really comes 

#### down to the age of the child and the setting. A newborn can be swaddled correctly and placed on their back in his crib 

#### at home, and it can help comfort and soothe them to sleep. When the child is older, in a new environment, with a 

##### Back to Top 


#### different caregiver, if they are learning to roll or perhaps haven't been swaddled before, swaddling becomes more 

#### challenging and risky.
