# Baby Bottles and Bisphenol A (BPA) 

## Many food and liquid containers, including baby bottles, are made of polycarbonate, or have a 

## lining that contains the chemical bisphenol A (BPA). BPA is used to harden plastics, keep bacteria 

## from contaminating foods, and prevent cans from rusting. 

## There are concerns, though, over the possible harmful effects BPA may have on humans, 

## particularly on infants and children. Animal studies have shown effects on the endocrine 

## functions in animals related to BPA exposure. Additional studies will determine what level of BPA 

## exposure might cause similar effects in humans. As research continues, concerned parents can 

## take the following precautionary measures to reduce babies’ exposure to BPA: 

## Avoid clear plastic baby bottles or containers with the recycling number 7 and the letters “PC” imprinted on 

## them. Many contain BPA. 

## Consider using certified or identified BPA-free plastic bottles. 

## Use bottles made of opaque plastic. These bottles (made of polyethylene or polypropylene) do not contain BPA. 

## You can also look for the recycle symbols with the number 2 or 5 in them. 

## Glass bottles can be an alternative, but be aware of the risk of injury to you or your baby if the bottle is dropped or 

## broken. 

## Because heat may cause the release of BPA from plastic, consider the following: 

## Do not boil polycarbonate bottles 

## Do not heat polycarbonate bottles in the microwave 

## Do not wash polycarbonate bottles in the dishwasher 

## Breastfeeding (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/default.aspx) Breastfeeding is another way to reduce 

## potential BPA exposure. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breastfeeding as the sole source of 

## nutrition for your baby for about 6 months. When you add solid foods to your baby’s diet, continue breastfeeding until 

## at least 12 months. 

## If you are considering switching from canned liquid to powdered formula, note that the mixing procedures may differ, 

## so pay special attention when preparing formula from powder. 

## If your baby is on specialized formula to address a medical condition, you should not switch to another formula, as the 

## known risks would outweigh any potential risks posed by BPA. 

## Risks associated with giving infants inappropriate (home-made condensed milk) formulas or alternative (soy or goat) 

## milk are far greater than the potential effects of BPA.
