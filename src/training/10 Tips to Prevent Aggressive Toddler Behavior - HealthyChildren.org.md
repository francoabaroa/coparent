# 10 Tips to Prevent Aggressive Toddler Behavior 

## There are many times when your child's behavior 

## warms and embraces your heart. But, there are other 

## times when it probably drives you a little crazy. As a 

## toddler or preschooler, your child may lack the self

## control to express anger peacefully and may naturally 

## lash out, perhaps hitting or biting in frustration. 

## While occasional outbursts are 

## normal―especially during 

## temper tantrums 

## (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/communication

## discipline/Pages/Temper-Tantrums.aspx)―there are things you can 

## do to shape your child's behavior. 

## 1. Teach the house rules. Children don't know the rules of the house until they're taught them, so that is one of 

## your important parenting responsibilities. Toddlers are normally interested in touching and exploring, so if there 

## are valuables you don't want them to handle, hide or remove them. Consider setting up a separate portion of your 

## home where your child can play with books and toys. Whenever children break an important rule, they should 

## be reprimanded immediately to understand exactly what they have done wrong. 

## 2. Threats are over-rated. It is always more effective to positively reinforce desired behaviors and to teach 

## children alternative behaviors rather than just say, "Stop it or else." Tell them that the next time they are angry, 

## they should use their words instead. 

## 3. Enter healthy distractions. While teaching your child other ways to respond, there's also nothing wrong with 

## distracting him at times or trying another approach. As long as you're not "bribing" him to behave differently by 

## offering sweet snacks. For example, there's nothing wrong with intentionally changing his focus. 

## 4. "Control yourself." Well, they can't yet. Remember, toddlers have little natural self-control. They need you to 

## teach them not to kick, hit, or bite when they are angry, but instead to express their feelings through words. 

## 5. "We don't hurt each other." Supervise your child carefully when she is involved in disputes with playmates. If a 

## disagreement is minor, keep your distance and let the children solve it on their own. However, you must 

## intervene when children get into a physical fight that continues even after they're told to stop, or when one child 

## seems to be in an uncontrollable rage and is assaulting or biting the other. Pull the children apart and keep them 

## separate until they have calmed down. If the fight is extremely violent, you may have to end the play session. 

## Make it clear that it doesn't matter who "started it." There is no excuse for trying to hurt each other. 

## 6. Instead of fighting. Teach your child to say "no" in a firm tone of voice, to turn his back, or to find compromises 

## instead of fighting with his body. Through example, you are teaching your child to settle differences with words— 

## more effective and more civilized—than with physical violence. 

## 7. "Great job!" Praise your child for appropriate behavior and help explain how "grown-up" she is acting whenever 

## she uses these tactics instead of hitting, kicking, or biting. And always reinforce and praise behavior when you 

## catch your child being kind and gentle. 

## 8. Time-outs are OK. There's also nothing wrong with using a time-out when your child's behavior is inappropriate, 

## and they can be used in children as young as one year old. See How to Give a Time-Out (/English/family

## life/family-dynamics/communication-discipline/Pages/Time-Outs-101.aspx) for more information. 


### 9. Control your own temper. Always watch your own behavior around your child. One of the best ways to teach 

### him appropriate behavior is to control your own temper. If you express your anger in quiet, peaceful ways, your 

### child probably will follow your example. 

### 10. Stay strong. If you must discipline your child, do not feel guilty about it and certainly don't apologize. If your 

### child senses your mixed feelings, he will convince himself that he was in the right all along and you are the "bad" 

### one. Although disciplining your child is never pleasant, it is a necessary part of parenthood, and there is no 

### reason to feel guilty about it. Your child needs to understand when he is in the wrong, it is important to take 

### responsibility for his actions and be willing to accept the consequences. 

## What's the difference between discipline and punishment? 

### While many parents think that discipline and punishment are the same thing, they are not. 

### Discipline is a way of teaching and a way of enhancing a good parent-child relationship. When you discipline, 

### you should provide your child with praise along with instruction in a firm tone, with the intent of improving his 

### or her behavior. 

### Punishment is a negative, in which you're dispensing an unpleasant consequence when your child does or 

### doesn't do something. Punishment is a part of discipline, but only a small part. 

### Until age three and sometimes later, children simply don't understand the concept of punishment. Setting 

### limits is a much better approach than punishment; most children will respond to clear, calm, and decisive 

### limit-setting. 

## When to call the pediatrician 

### If your child seems to be unusually aggressive for longer than a few weeks, and you cannot cope with his behavior on 

### your own, consult your pediatrician. Other warning signs include: 

### Physical injury to himself or others (teeth marks, bruises, head injuries) 

### Attacks on you or other adults 

### Being sent home or barred from play by neighbors or school 

### Your own fear for the safety of those around him 

### The most important warning sign is the frequency of outbursts. Sometimes children with conduct disorders 

### (/English/health-issues/conditions/emotional-problems/Pages/Behavioral-and-Disruptive-Disorders.aspx) will go for 

### several days or a week or two without incident and may even act quite charming during this time, but few can go an 

### entire month without getting into trouble at least once. 

### Once several effective ways are found to reward good behavior and discourage bad, they can be used in establishing 

### an approach that works both at home and away. The progress may be slow, but such programs usually are successful if 

### started when the disorder is just beginning to develop. 

## Remember 

### The best way to prevent aggressive behavior is to give your child a stable, secure home life with firm, loving discipline 

### and full-time supervision during the toddler and preschool years.
