# Tracking Your Baby's Weight and Measurements 

## What makes a baby big or small? The following are some of the most common causes: 

## Large Babies: An infant can be born large when the parents are large or the mother is 

## overweight. There is also a greater likelihood of a large newborn due to factors such as: 

## The pregnancy lasting longer than forty-two weeks 

## The fetus’s growth over stimulated in the uterus 

## Fetal chromosomal abnormalities 

## Weight gain during pregnancy 

## The mother’s ethnicity 

## The mother having diabetes before or during pregnancy 

## The mother having given birth to other children 

## Having a boy 

## Large infants may have metabolic abnormalities (such as low blood sugar and calcium), traumatic birth injuries, 

## higher hemoglobin levels, jaundice, or various congenital abnormalities. Almost one-third of large babies initially 

## have feeding difficulties. Your pediatrician will keep a close watch on these issues. 

## Small Babies: A baby may be born small for a number of reasons, including: 

## Being born early (preterm) 

## Being born to small parents 

## The mother’s ethnicity 

## Fetal chromosomal abnormalities 

## The mother’s chronic diseases such as high blood pressure, or heart or kidney disease 

## Malnutrition 

## The mother’s substance abuse during pregnancy 

## A small baby may need to have his temperature, glucose, and hemoglobin level closely monitored. After birth, the 

## pediatrician will thoroughly evaluate a small infant and decide when he is ready to go home. 

## To determine how your baby’s measurements compare with those of other babies born after the same length of 

## pregnancy, your pediatrician will refer to a growth chart. 

## Growth charts (/english/tips-tools/pages/default.aspx#growth-charts) examine length and weight in boys and girls, 

## from birth to thirty-six months. They are followed by body mass index for age charts for boys and girls, ages two to 

## twenty years. (Body mass index, or BMI, is a measure of weight in relation to height.) 

## Eighty out of every one hundred babies born at forty weeks of pregnancy, or full term, weigh between 5 pounds 11-1⁄2 

## ounces (2.6 kg) and 8 pounds 5-3⁄4 ounces (3.8 kg). This is a healthy average. Those above the ninetieth percentile on 

## the chart are considered large, and those below the tenth percentile are regarded as small. Keep in mind that these 

## early weight designations (large or small) do not predict whether a child will be above or below average when he 

## grows up, but they do help the hospital staff determine whether he needs extra attention during the first few days after 

## birth. 

## At every physical exam, beginning with the first one after birth, the pediatrician will routinely measure the baby’s 

## length, weight, and head circumference (the distance around his head) and will plot them on growth charts. In a 

## healthy, well-nourished infant, these three important measurements should increase at a predictable rate. Any 

## interruption in this rate can help the doctor better detect and address any feeding, developmental, or medical issues.
