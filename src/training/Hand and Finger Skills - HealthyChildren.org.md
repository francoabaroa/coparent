# Hand and Finger Skills 

## Your baby’s mastery of crawling, standing, and walking are bound to be his most dramatic 

## accomplishments during these months, but don’t overlook all the wonderful things he’s learning 

## to do with his hands. At the beginning of this period, he’ll still clumsily “rake” things toward 

## himself, but by the end, he’ll grasp accurately with his thumb and first or second finger. You’ll 

## find him practicing this pincer movement on any small object, from dust balls to cereal, and he 

## may even try to snap his fingers if you show him how. 

## As your baby learns to open his fingers at will, he’ll delight in dropping and throwing things. If 

## you leave small toys on the tray of his high chair or in his playpen, he’ll fling them down and then 

## call loudly for someone to retrieve them so he can do it again. If he throws hard objects such as blocks, he might do 

## some damage and probably will increase the noise level in your household considerably. Your life will be a little 

## calmer if you redirect him toward softer objects, such as balls of various sizes, colors, and textures. (Include some with 

## beads or chimes inside so they make a sound as they roll.) One activity that not only is fun but allows you to observe 

## your child’s developing skills is to sit on the floor and roll a large ball toward him. At first, he’ll slap randomly at it, but 

## eventually he’ll learn to swat it so it rolls back in your direction. 

## With his improved coordination, your baby can now investigate the objects he encounters more thoroughly. He’ll 

## pick them up, shake them, bang them, and pass them from hand to hand. He’ll be particularly intrigued by toys with 

## moving parts—wheels that spin, levers that can be moved, hinges that open and close. Holes also are fascinating 

## because he can poke his fingers in them and, when he becomes a little more skilled, drop things through them. 

## Blocks are another favorite toy at this age. In fact, nothing motivates a baby to crawl quite as much as a tower waiting 

## to be toppled. Toward the end of this period, your child may even start to build towers of his own by stacking one block 

## on top of another.
