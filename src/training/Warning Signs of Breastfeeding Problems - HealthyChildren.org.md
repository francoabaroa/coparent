# Warning Signs of Breastfeeding Problems 

## Natural as the breastfeeding process is, problems can occasionally arise. When they do surface, 

## they may grow worse very quickly and interfere with your milk production or your baby’s ability 

## to get the nutrition she needs. For this reason, it’s vital to get help right away if you experience 

## difficulty with breastfeeding at home or observe any of the symptoms listed below. Contact your 

## baby’s pediatrician, and don’t stop asking for one-on-one guidance until you get the help you 

## need. 

## Your baby’s nursing sessions are either very short or extremely long. Breastfeeding 

## sessions that are consistently briefer than about ten minutes during the first few months 

## may mean that your baby isn’t getting enough milk and that not enough milk is being removed to stimulate your 

## ongoing milk production. Sessions that last consistently longer than about fifty minutes may mean that your 

## baby isn’t receiving enough milk due to ineffective suckling or low milk production. 

## Your baby still seems hungry after most feedings. She may not be ingesting enough milk. Consult your 

## pediatrician and have her weighed right away. Meanwhile, double-check her latch-on and position at the breast 

## to try to increase the milk she is getting. 

## Your newborn frequently misses nursing sessions or sleeps through the night. Frequent feedings around 

## the clock are a necessary part of breastfeeding a new baby. Your baby requires a feeding every few hours to gain 

## sufficient weight to thrive. If your newborn sleeps longer than four hours a night, wake her up and encourage her 

## to nurse. You don’t hear frequent swallowing when your baby nurses after your milk supply has come in. Your 

## baby will probably swallow occasionally as she begins to nurse, more frequently as she continues a session, and 

## less frequently again near the end. Swallowing is an excellent sign that she is actually ingesting milk, and its 

## absence should prompt you to call her pediatrician at once. (Remember, though, that you may not be able to hear 

## your baby swallowing when she is taking small sips of colostrum in the early days.) 

## By two weeks of age, your baby is under her birth weight or hasn’t started gaining at least 5 to 7 ounces per 

## week since your milk came in. Inadequate weight gain is one of the strongest indicators that a baby is not 

## getting enough milk. 

## After seven days, your baby has fewer than six wet diapers and four stools per day, her urine is dark 

## yellow or specked with red, or her stools are still dark rather than yellow and loose. If you or your 

## pediatrician is concerned about your child’s milk intake, you might want to keep a written record of your baby’s 

## wet diapers and bowel movements during the early days to be sure she is progressing properly. Most hospitals 

## and lactation specialists can provide you with a special diary to use in recording your newborn’s feedings and 

## diaper changes. 

## After five days, your milk hasn’t come in or your breasts don’t feel as though they’re filling with milk. If 

## you feel this way, have your baby weighed by her pediatrician immediately. This is the most precise way to tell 

## whether she is ingesting enough milk. You may also want to have your breasts examined. 

## You experience severe breast engorgement. Hard, painful breasts may prevent your baby from latching on 

## correctly and discourage both of you from nursing. You may need to express milk manually or with an electric 

## breast pump until your breasts have softened somewhat. Severe, unrelieved engorgement can decrease your 

## milk supply. 

## The fullness and hardness of your breasts don’t decrease by the end of a feeding. Your baby may not be 

## drinking enough milk or may be suckling ineffectively. 

## Severe pain interferes with breastfeeding. Your baby is probably not latching on correctly. If you have severe 

## nipple pain or significant cracking of the nipples that makes it too painful to nurse, consult your physician or 

## lactation specialist. She can check for a nipple or breast infection such as mastitis and help you with any 

## problems with latching on. You may need to start breastfeeding on the less sore side or even use an electric 

## breast pump until your nipples have healed. Your lactation specialist or La Leche volunteer can show you how to 

## do this. 

## After a week or two, you don’t notice the sensations associated with your milk let-down reflex. Though this 

## may not indicate a problem at all, it could mean that your milk production is low. Ask your baby’s pediatrician to 

## evaluate her and observe your breastfeeding technique. Your local La Leche League volunteer or lactation 

## specialist can help assess the situation, too.
