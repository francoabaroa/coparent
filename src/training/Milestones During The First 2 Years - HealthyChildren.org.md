# Milestones During The First 2 Years 

## Long before your baby utters her first word, she has already started communicating with you, 

## using smiles, looks, movements, and sounds. Children develop at different rates, but they usually 

## are able to do certain things at certain ages. Following are general developmental milestones. 

## Keep in mind that they are only guidelines. 

## If you have any questions about your baby’s development, ask your child’s pediatrician—the 

## sooner the better. Even when there are delays (/English/ages-stages/toddler/Pages/Assessing

## Developmental-Delays.aspx), early intervention can make a significant difference. 

## By 1 year, most babies will 

## Look for and be able to find where a sound is coming from. 

## Respond to their name most of the time when you call it. 

## Wave goodbye. 

## Look where you point when you say, “Look at the _________.” 

## Babble with intonation (voice rises and falls as if they are speaking in sentences). 

## Take turns “talking” with you—listen and pay attention to you when you speak and then resume babbling when 

## you stop. 

## Say “da-da” to dad and “ma-ma” to mom. 

## Say at least 1 word. 

## Point to items they want that are out of reach or make sounds while pointing. 

## Between 1 and 2 years, most toddlers will 

## Follow simple commands, first when the adult speaks and gestures, and then later with words alone. 

## Get objects from another room when asked. 

## Point to a few body parts when asked. 

## Point to interesting objects or events to get you to look at them too. 

## Bring things to you to show you. 

## Point to objects so you will name them. 

## Name a few common objects and pictures when asked. 

## Enjoy pretending (for example, pretend cooking). They will use gestures and words with you or with a favorite 

## stuffed animal or doll. 

## Learn about 1 new word per week between 1½ and 2 years. 

## By 2 years of age, most toddlers will 

## Point to many body parts and common objects. 

## Point to some pictures in books. 

## Follow 1-step commands without a gesture like “Put your cup on the table.” 

## Be able to say about 50 to 100 words. 

## Say several 2-word sentences and phrases like “Daddy go,” “Doll mine,” and “All gone.” 

## Be understood by others (or by adults) about half of the time.
