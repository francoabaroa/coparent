# Sports and Visual Ability in Toddlers 

## Vision is not mature in this age group, and toddlers have difficulty tracking a moving object and 

## figuring out how fast it is speeding toward them. This poor score on visual skills is related to eye 

## movements that are not precise, minor farsightedness, and incomplete development of vision 

## centers in the brain. Hopefully, this information makes it is easier to see why it is difficult for 

## some kids in this age group to hit or catch a moving ball in tennis, basketball, football, softball, 

## baseball, or volleyball, or judge an upcoming wall for a flip turn. 

## It is not simply a lack of coordination or just needing more practice; it is a lack of true visual 

## maturity that is the culprit. Now that age-old phrase of hand-eye coordination finally makes more 

## sense! If 4-year-old Jermaine cannot hit or catch a ball you throw at him in the backyard 100 times, please repeat after 

## me—“Jermaine is not a failure at sports.” 

## Congratulations and hats off to organizations like Little League baseball that have adapted to make up for the natural 

## deficits at this age with such activities as T-ball. Toddlers and young children can do much better if they are allowed to 

## kick or swing at a stationary ball. 

## Many sports situations would be better for kids if the ball sizes, playing fields, equipment, and practice times were 

## more custom-made for those young learning beings.
