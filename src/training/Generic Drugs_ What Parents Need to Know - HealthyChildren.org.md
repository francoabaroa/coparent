# Generic Drugs: What Parents Need to Know 

## What are generic drugs? 

## Generic drugs are usually lower cost alternatives of brand-name 

## drugs that have the same active ingredient and dosage form and 

## work in the same way as their brand-name counterpart. They may 

## however, have a different size, color or shape because some of the 

## non-drug ingredients (e.g. flavoring, coloring agents) may be 

## different. Some generic drugs are even made by the brand name 

## manufacturer, but they are just sold as a lower cost alternative. 

## Most generic drugs, though, are made by other manufacturers who 

## have received approval by the US Food and Drug Administration 

## (FDA) to sell their generic alternative. 

## A generic drug is identical to a brand name drug in the following ways: 

## Dosage form 

## Safety 

## Strength 

## Route of administration 

## Quality 

## Performance characteristics 

## Intended use 

## Why are generic drugs important? 

## The availability of generic drugs helps increase competition and lowers the cost of medications. Use of generic drugs 

## may reduce your prescription insurance co-payment (/English/family-life/health-management/health

## insurance/Pages/Understanding-Cost-Sharing-Deductibles-Copayments-Coinsurance.aspx). Ask your pediatrician 

## whether a generic alternative is available for your child's medication and if it is an appropriate alternative. 

## Why do brand-name drugs cost more? 

## Companies that produce brand-name medications invest money in the research, development, and marketing of new 

## drugs. They price these drugs higher to recover some of these costs. New drugs are protected by patents from being 

## produced in a generic form by other companies. When the patents or other periods of exclusivity on a brand-name 

## drug expire, other companies may apply to the FDA to sell a generic version. Since generic drug makers do not 

## develop a drug from scratch, the costs to bring the drug to market are less; therefore, generic drugs are usually less 

## expensive than brand-name drugs. 

## What is the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process 

## for generic drugs? 

## All drugs, both brand and generic, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration must meet the same high 

## standards for quality, strength, purity, and stability. Generic competitors may submit an application to sell a generic 

## version of a brand drug when the patent or other periods of exclusivity on a brand-name drug expires. The FDA must 

## review and approve the generic drug application before the drug is made available to the public. The generic 

## manufacturing, packaging, and testing sites must pass the same quality standards as those of brand name drugs 


## What is a preferred drug in my formulary (/English/family

## life/health-management/health-insurance/Pages/Your-Health

## Plans-Formulary.aspx)? 

### Preferred drugs are those that are covered by your insurance company (/English/family-life/health

### management/health-insurance/Pages/Things-to-Consider-When-Evaluating-Health-Insurance-Plans.aspx) and do 

### not need your pediatrician to call the insurance company for authorization. If your pediatrician prescribes a non

### preferred drug, he or she or his or her representative will need to contact your prescription insurance provider to get 

### approval for the drug to be covered. This can be done via phone, fax, or email. 

## Are generic drugs as effective as brand-name drugs? 

### Yes. A generic drug is the same as a brand-name drug in dosage, safety, strength, quality, the way it works, the 

### way it is taken, and the way it should be used. 

## What if my child is allergic to a generic drug? 

### Since brand-name drugs and generic drugs have the same active ingredient, it is very likely that if you are allergic 

### (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/medication-safety/Pages/Medication-Side-Effects.aspx) to the brand-name 

### drug, you will also be allergic to the generic drug and vice-versa. In this situation, you will need to take an alternate 

### drug. Your insurance company should cover this. 

## How do I know if I am receiving a "generic" drug from my pharmacy? 

### Pharmacies often substitute a brand-name drug for a generic drug unless state law does not allow it. If your 

### pediatrician writes "Dispense as written" on your prescription, then your pharmacy cannot dispense a generic drug to 

### you for your child. Your pediatrician may do this if he or she feels that the generic drug is not right for your child. 

## Is there a "generic" for every brand-name drug? 

### No, not every brand-name drug has a generic drug. When new drugs are first made they have drug patents. The 

### patent, which protects the company that made the drug first, doesn't allow anyone else to make and sell the drug. 

### When the patent expires, other drug companies can start selling a generic version of the drug. But, first, they must test 

### the drug and the FDA must approve it. 

## Talk with Your Pediatrician 

### You should discuss any questions or concerns you have with your pediatrician. He or she will help determine whether 

### a generic medication is appropriate for your child.
