# How Often To Breastfeed 

## "How often should I feed my baby?" is one of the most frequent questions new mothers ask. The 

## simple answer to that question is, “As often as he’s willing.” 

## Don’t wait until your baby cries to put him to the breast. Crying is a late sign of hunger. He will 

## indicate his desire to breastfeed long before he cries by smacking his lips, making suckling 

## motions, rooting (moving his head around in search of your breast), kicking and squirming, or 

## looking more alert. Your baby may give you such signals as often as every hour or so in the early 

## days after birth. 

## He should not go longer than about two to three hours during the day or four hours at night without a feeding. Even if 

## you have to wake him up, be sure he receives eight to twelve feedings in every twenty-four-hour period. If he does not 

## feed at first upon being awakened, wait half an hour, wake him up, and try again. Some babies will nurse even when 

## they are not wide awake, so you don’t have to awaken them completely. 

## Soon you will become familiar with your baby’s feeding style—active and eager, sleepy and dreamy, or focused and 

## intent. In the meantime, encourage him to feed as long as possible at each feeding. Keep him at your breast as long as 

## he is actively suckling. Detaching a suckling baby from your breast before he’s finished, or allowing him to fall asleep 

## shortly after beginning to feed, may throw off the breastfeeding rhythm of supply and demand. 

## Allow him to breastfeed until he seems full (at this point he will probably detach from the breast all by himself). Keep 

## in mind that the longer your baby nurses, the higher the fat content of the milk he is drinking. Shorter, timed nursing 

## periods may not allow him the opportunity to enjoy the full benefits of your breastmilk and may leave your breasts 

## full of unreleased milk, making you feel engorged and uncomfortable.
