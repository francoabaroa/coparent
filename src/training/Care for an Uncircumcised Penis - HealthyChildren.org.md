# Care for an Uncircumcised Penis 

## Our son is not circumcised. When will his foreskin 

## retract? 

## In the first several years your son's foreskin will separate from the tip of the penis. Some 

## foreskins separate soon after birth or even before birth, but this is rare. When it happens is 

## different for every child. It may take a few weeks, months, or years. Once this happens, the 

## foreskin can be pulled back away from the tip of the penis. This is called foreskin retraction. 

## Most boys will be able to retract their foreskins by the time they are 5 years old, yet others will not be able to until the 

## teen years. As a boy becomes more aware of his body, he will most likely discover how to retract his own foreskin. But 

## foreskin retraction should never be forced. Until the foreskin fully separates, do not try to pull it back. Forcing the 

## foreskin to retract before it is ready can cause severe pain, bleeding, and tears in the skin. 

## Smegma 

## When the foreskin separates from the head of the penis, skin cells are shed. These skin cells may look like white, 

## pearl-like lumps under the foreskin. These are called smegma. Smegma is normal and nothing to worry about. 

## Cleaning 

## If your son's foreskin separates before he reaches puberty, an occasional retraction with cleansing beneath will do. 

## Once your son starts puberty, he should clean beneath his foreskin as part of his daily routine, just like washing his 

## hair and brushing his teeth. 

## Teach your son to clean his foreskin in the following way: 

## Step 1 : Gently pull the foreskin back away from the end of the penis. 

## Step 2 : Rinse underneath the foreskin with soap and warm water. 

## Step 3 : Pull the foreskin back over the penis
