# Alcohol & Breast Milk 

## Alcohol passes through your breast milk to your baby, 

## so the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 

## recommends avoiding drinking alcohol while 

## breastfeeding. 

## What You Should Know: 

## Drinking beer does not increase your milk supply, 

## as urban myth(s) suggests. 

## Consuming alcohol of any kind may decrease the 

## amount of milk (/English/ages

## stages/baby/breastfeeding/pages/Making-Sure-Your-Baby-is-Getting-Enough-Milk.aspx) your baby drinks. 

## Alcohol can change the taste of your milk, and some babies may not like it. 

## Breastfeeding your baby while consuming alcohol can pose a risk to your infant if he or she consumes breast 

## milk with alcohol. 

## Expressing or pumping milk after drinking alcohol, and then discarding it ("pumping and dumping"), does NOT 

## reduce the amount of alcohol present in your milk quicker. As your alcohol blood level falls over time, the level 

## of alcohol in your breast milk will also decrease. Breast milk continues to contain alcohol if alcohol is still in your 

## bloodstream. 

## If You Choose to Have an Alcoholic Drink: 

## If you are going to have an alcohol containing beverage, it is best to 

## do so just after you nurse or pump milk rather than before. 

## Breastfeeding or pumping breast milk is ok 2 hours after your 

## last drink. That way, your body will have as much time as possible 

## to rid itself of the alcohol before the next feeding and less will reach 

## your infant. 

## Caring for a baby while intoxicated is not safe! 

## Drinking alcohol could impair your judgment and your ability to safely care for your baby. If you drink excessively, 

## arrange for a sober adult to care for your baby during this time. 

## Know the Effects of Repeated Alcohol Exposure to Your Breastfed 

## Baby: 

## There are increasing concerns about long-term, repeated exposure of infants to alcohol via the mother's breast milk, 

## so moderation is advised. Chronic consumption of alcohol may also reduce milk production (/English/ages

## stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Milk-Supply.aspx). 


### More things to avoid when breastfeeding: 

##### Caffeine. Breast milk usually contains less than 1% of the caffeine ingested by the mom. If you drink no more than 

##### three cups of coffee spread throughout the day, there is little to no caffeine detected in the baby's urine. However, if 

##### you feel that your infant becomes more fussy or irritable when you consume excessive amounts of 

##### caffeine―usually more than five caffeinated beverages per day―consider decreasing your intake. 

##### Mercury. Most people are not affected by these tiny amounts of mercury, but mercury can cause damage to the 

##### nervous system in babies and small children. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) 

##### encourages breastfeeding mothers to follow the FDA and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) advice 

##### (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/19/2017-01073/advice-about-eating-fish-from-the

##### environmental-protection-agency-and-food-and-drug-administration) regarding fish consumption: 

##### Eat 2-3 servings a week (8 to 12 ounces in total) of a variety of fish 

##### Eat only 1 serving a week (no more than 6 ounces) of some fish, such as albacore (white) tuna and fish with 

##### similar mercury concentrations to albacore (white) tuna 

##### Avoid certain fish with the highest mercury concentrations 

##### Check for advisories for fish caught by family and friends and where no advisories exist; limit eating those fish 

##### to one serving a week and do not eat other fish that week. 

##### Marijuana. No amount of marijuana (/English/ages-stages/prenatal/Pages/Marijuana-Use-During-Pregnancy

##### Breastfeeding.aspx)has been proven safe to use during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. You may pass the 

##### chemicals from marijuana to your baby through breastmilk. A study 

#### (https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/142/3/e20181076) in the September 2018 Pediatrics confirms earlier 

##### findings (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29630019) that THC can transfer into breastmilk. The AAP also 

##### reminds that a mother's ability to care for an infant may be impaired while using marijuana. Bottomline: If you are 

##### breastfeeding, don't use marijuana. 

##### Tobacco, including e-cigarettes (/English/ages-stages/prenatal/Pages/E-Cigarette-Use-During-Pregnancy

##### Breastfeeding.aspx). Inhaled nicotine enters a mother's blood through her lungs, and then easily passes into 

##### breastmilk. Research (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2277470/) shows that nicotine in a mother's 

##### breastmilk can affect infant sleep pattern. Nicotine is also thought to decrease milk supply (/English/ages

##### stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Decreased-Milk-Supply.aspx) in nursing mothers, possibly by lowering levels of 

##### the breastmilk-stimulating hormone prolactin. 

#### Note: Because of the many benefits breastfeeding has for infants and moms, the AAP and the ACOG recommend 

#### breastfeeding even if you continue to use e-cigarettes. If it's not the right time for you to quit, make a plan to reduce 

#### your baby's exposure to cigarette smoke. Learn more here (/English/ages-stages/prenatal/Pages/E-Cigarette-Use

#### During-Pregnancy-Breastfeeding.aspx).
