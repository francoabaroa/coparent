# A Breastfeeding Checklist: Are You Nursing Correctly? 

## Signs of Correct Nursing 

## Your baby’s mouth is open wide with lips turned out. 

## His chin and nose are resting against the breast. 

## He has taken as much of the areola as possible into his mouth. 

## He is suckling rhythmically and deeply, in short bursts separated by pauses. 

## You can hear him swallowing regularly. 

## Your nipple is comfortable after the first few suckles. 

## Signs of Incorrect Nursing 

## Your baby’s head is not in line with his body. 

## He is sucking on the nipple only, instead of suckling on the 

## areola with the nipple far back in his mouth. 

## He is sucking in a light, quick, fluttery manner rather than taking deep, regular sucks. 

## His cheeks are puckered inward or you hear clicking noises. 

## You don’t hear him swallow regularly after your milk production has increased. 

## You experience pain throughout the feed or have signs of nipple damage (such as cracking or bleeding).
