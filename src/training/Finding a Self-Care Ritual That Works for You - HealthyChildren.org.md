# Finding a Self-Care Ritual That Works for You 

## By: Whitney Casares, MD, MPH, FAAP 

## My friend Jenny is a go-getter. She likes lists and 

## agendas. She thrives on structure. 

## "When I have a day to myself (which I hardly ever have), 

## I find myself overplanning it, making an itinerary for 

## myself even if I don't have to," she told me. "By 5:00 pm 

## I'm exhausted. I'm realizing that I'm just as type A about 

## my self-care as I am about my job." 

## Jenny, like many moms, has a tendency to make self

## care (/English/family-life/family

## dynamics/Pages/Importance-of-Self-Care.aspx) yet another chore instead of a much-deserved reset. Self-care is about 

## finding ways to make sure, as we're working, and parenting, and doing all the "stuff" of life, that we fit in opportunities 

## to actually live it. It's about allowing time to do things that make us truly joyful, not just at the end of our working mom 

## journeys but also along the way there. 

## Over the years I've learned to be more flexible and aware that I'm ultimately a tiny ant on a big, huge, spinning planet 

## —one I'm not spinning. But even if we're not in complete control of the world or of our lives, we are absolutely, 100% 

## (please listen because I am going to say this with italics so it will stand out to you) in control of the way we respond to 

## the world around us, the way we show up for ourselves and our families. We're in control of the way we choose to 

## spend our efforts and time. 

## That means that we're in control of choosing to take moments—and sometimes hours—specifically for ourselves. 

## Decide you're worth 5 minutes a day 

## When you wake up in the morning, you are starting fresh on your journey toward social-emotional health for you and 

## your family. You have a chance to renew your commitment to your dreams and your priorities. Take it. Decide you're 

## worth 5 minutes a day thinking about the things you're grateful for, visualizing who you want to be, and remembering 

## what your priorities are. 

## If you're inching toward a dream, use that time to think about the goal you're working on to get there. As you move 

## through your day, all kinds of distractions and barriers are going to come up, so find 5 minutes early on to get 

## intentional about what really matters to you. 

## You could use your 5 minutes alone in the shower to do this, or take 5 minutes in the car on the way to work to move 

## through this process. When I have early morning meetings, I use the microphone feature on my phone to record my 

## 5-minute sessions. The point is to take the time to remember why you do what you do. 

## Find a self-care plan that fits your life 

## As you develop a self-care plan, you'll have to decide how much time you're willing or able to commit to on a weekly 

## basis. What is something you can do about every other day, almost every single week? If you can commit to 3 times a 

## week most weeks, it will be often enough that you stick with it, and it will become a routine. If you can get to your 

## activity more often, awesome, but 3 times a week is a great start. 

## Start with exercise 

## If there was going to be one single activity that is worth time by yourself and for yourself, physical fitness 

## (/English/healthy-living/fitness/Pages/Making-Fitness-a-Way-of-Life.aspx) (if you choose the right activity—anything 

## with an endorphin release) or meditation takes the cake. Physical fitness can give you the chance to deepen your 


#### social connections, be mindful, work on your own physical fitness, and set goals for yourself. Meditation also checks 

#### many of those same boxes, but there is something valuable in moving our bodies as a way to clear the mental and 

#### physical cobwebs away. 

## Make it a multitasker 

#### It makes sense to bundle your benefits so that you get the most bang for your buck from the activity you choose. Look 

#### back at your priority list—is there something you can do that accomplishes multiple goals for you? Here are some 

#### examples. 

#### Group exercise class —stress relief, physical fitness, mindfulness, camaraderie, alone time to and from the 

#### activity 

#### A walk around the neighborhood —fresh air, visual change of pace, physical fitness, mindfulness, maybe an 

#### errand or two 

#### Virtual hangout with a friend —building community and support, stress relief, good food 

## Avoid stressful extras or add-ons 

#### When my first daughter was born, I really could not wait to get out of the house. She was colicky and exhausting, and, 

#### in turn, I was a hot mess. It was obvious that I needed a bit of time away from her, but I felt guilty about it, so instead of 

#### using minutes and hours away from her to actually spend time on self-care, I spent time doing chores. It helped me 

#### feel like I was accomplishing something, like there was a reason beyond self-preservation for getting out and away. 

#### Unfortunately, my plan of cramming a bunch of tasks into each free hour I had quickly backfired. Instead of feeling 

#### relaxed and ready to parent when I returned home, I felt like the family servant. I did all the work when I was at home 

#### with her, when I was at work, and when I was away from her in my "spare time." 

#### I'm not alone in filling up hours away from my kids with to-dos, obligations, and tasks. I see moms every day in my 

#### office weighed down by the items on their lists, by the checkboxes that have yet to be checked for the day. Instead, pick 

#### some times for you that are only about taking care of yourself so you can come home refreshed. 

## Filter out the to-dos 

### Moms who focus solely on getting things done miss out on life, plain and simple. Instead, think about how to lessen 

#### your load. If you have a partner, figure out a plan for dividing responsibilities along strength lines. No matter what 

#### your family construct, stop doing everything for everyone else. Get other people on your team, including your kids. 

#### Coaching kids to help with household tasks in an age-appropriate way builds your family community, teaches 

#### responsibility, and helps kids develop resilience. 

## Be OK with the stage of parenthood you're in now & what that means 

## for your self-care 

#### If you're reading this while holding your newborn and feeling like, "I can barely take a quick shower, let alone plan out 

#### a priority list for myself," remember—there is a season. Even though it's tempting to wish you could hurry ahead to 

#### more balance, you may just need to be still for now. Your priorities and your bandwidth may change as your kids grow 

#### and your work demands change. What seemed impossible to me as a new mom is a daily part of my life now that my 

#### kids are a little older. It's just a fact that our self-care options may change depending on the stage of motherhood we're 

#### in, and that's perfectly OK. 

#### My wish for you, as you think about ways to incorporate self-care into your own life, is that you'll see self-care as a 

#### reflection of motherhood in general: perfect would be nice but that less than perfect can be pretty amazing too.
