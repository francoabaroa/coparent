# Managing Older Siblings While Breastfeeding 

## Many women who breastfeed their newborns wonder how their older children will respond to 

## nursing sessions and worry about how to keep older siblings occupied during frequent early 

## breastfeeding sessions. It’s safe to assume that all your children will show a healthy curiosity 

## about this amazing and beautiful manner of feeding a brand-new baby. As long as you explain the 

## nursing process in simple language and maintain a matter-of-fact approach to their questions 

## and their desire to watch the baby breastfeed, such “family time” may turn out to be a positive 

## and educational experience for all. 

## Don’t be surprised if your older children tend to hover nearby during nursing sessions or even 

## try to climb into your lap. Include them if you can by talking about how you used to breastfeed them (if you did), giving 

## them a little hug with your free arm, telling them a story, or watching while they draw you a picture, work in a 

## workbook, or play with a toy. 

## Some mothers find that nursing sessions are wonderful times to listen to music or children’s stories with their babies’ 

## siblings. In this way, nursing time can be used to draw closer to all the children, not just the new one. Older children 

## may also be grateful for the chance to express the feelings of closeness that breastfeeding inspires by folding laundry 

## nearby, getting you a glass of water, holding the baby while you prepare to nurse, or otherwise contributing to their 

## family’s care. 

## If your toddler or preschooler asks if she can try nursing, the choice is obviously yours. In most cases, a child who is no 

## longer breastfed may find the experience too strange to try more than once. She will probably not remember how to 

## nurse and will run off, satisfied, after a quick experiment. 

## If you already have a nursing toddler who may not want to relinquish the breast when your new baby enters the 

## family, or if you feel that this is not the time to begin weaning, you may decide to tandem-nurse breastfeed both the 

## toddler and the newborn. If so, be sure to inform your newborn’s pediatrician of your decision so your infant’s growth 

## can be monitored more closely. 

## Keep in mind that while the older child can receive foods and liquids from other sources, your infant depends entirely 

## on your breast milk for her nutrition. Therefore, you should offer the breast to your infant first, and nurse your older 

## child only after your infant has had her fill. Also watch your own nutrition and energy levels more closely. You will 

## need to eat well enough to support the production of extra breast milk and get the additional rest necessary to handle 

## the extra demands on your body. Your baby’s pediatrician will be aware of all of these issues and can help you deal 

## with them. 

## You may wonder whether the newborn will still receive the advantages of colostrum during tandem nursing. Analysis 

## of mother’s milk shows that a mother who delivers a newborn does produce colostrum and milk designed to meet the 

## needs of the newborn, even though the mother is still nursing a toddler. This offers the desired advantages for the 

## newborn but no adverse consequences for the older child.
