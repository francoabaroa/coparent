# Postpartum Depression & Breastfeeding 

## Postpartum depression (PPD) occurs in about 1 in 7 women and can 

## begin anytime within the first year after giving birth. While mom 

## seeks help for her mental health needs, it is still possible to meet 

## breastfeeding goals (/English/ages

## stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Why-Breastfeed.aspx). 

## How PPD Effects Baby 

## There is no denying that a mother's mental health (/English/family

## life/family-dynamics/Pages/How-Taking-Care-of-Yourself-Makes

## you-a-Better-Mom.aspx) is crucial—not just to her, but also to her 

## baby. A depressed or anxious mom, however, may not be able to 

## provide the nurturing that her baby needs to grow and thrive. She is less likely to read to, cuddle with, and interact 

## with her baby—putting him or her at risk for a number of negative health outcomes, such as: 

## Failure to thrive 

## Delayed development 

## Sleep difficulties 

## Behavioral and emotional problems 

## Learning problems 

## Note that sometimes these symptoms take years to show up. In addition, many studies have also found mothers with 

## PPD neglect to follow the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) schedule of well-child visits (/English/family

## life/health-management/Pages/Well-Child-Care-A-Check-Up-for-Success.aspx) and health care advice, including 

## safety measures such as car seats and childproofing. 

## Identifying PPD: Who Should Screen and When? 

## Although pediatricians are trained to treat children, there are times when they also need to take care of parents. 

## Most women typically only have 1-2 postpartum visits with their obstetricians, where depression screening may not 

## always occur. Since a pediatrician can see a baby up to 6 times within the first 6 months of life, they are probably in the 

## best position to identify mothers suffering from PPD. It is for this reason that the AAP recommends 

## (http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2010/10/25/peds.2010-2348) pediatricians screen new mothers 

## for PPD at their baby's 1, 2, 4, and 6 month well-child visit. 

## The screening tool most pediatricians use is the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) 

## (http://www2.aap.org/sections/scan/practicingsafety/toolkit_resources/module2/epds.pdf)—a 10-item questionnaire 

## for mom to fill out. 

## Help Preserving Mom's Breastfeeding Goals 

## If a mother is experiencing PPD, it is natural for her doctor to ask her what parts of her day bring her joy and peace, 

## and what makes her symptoms worse. In doing so, it is important to know where breastfeeding falls. 

## The AAP recommends (http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2011-3552) exclusive breastfeeding 

## for about 6 months, with continuation of breastfeeding for 1 year or longer as mutually desired by mother and infant. 

## If breastfeeding is helping a mom bond with her baby vs. contributing to her symptoms, then her PPD 

## treatment can and should be built around protecting that breastfeeding relationship. If breastfeeding is 

## contributing to a mom's PPD symptoms, she should not feel guilty if she chooses to seek alternative forms of

#### feeding. 

## Antidepressant Medication & Breastfeeding 

#### Treatment for PPD typically includes some combination of antidepressant medication (/English/health

#### issues/conditions/treatments/Pages/Common-Medications-for-Psychiatric-Disorders.aspx) and talk therapy. Peer 

#### support, such as support groups, and sleep are important aspects of therapy, as well. 

#### Many medications to treat postpartum mood and anxiety disorders are safe to use while breastfeeding. Medication to 

### treat the mother should not be withheld. See Medication Safety Tips for the Breastfeeding Mom (/English/ages

### stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Medications-and-Breastfeeding.aspx) for more information. 

## Remember... 

#### All children deserve the chance to have a healthy mom. And all moms deserve the chance to enjoy their life and their 

#### children. If you are feeling depressed during pregnancy or after having a baby, don't suffer alone. Please tell a loved 

#### one and call your doctor right away.
