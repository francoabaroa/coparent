# 5 Superpowers You Can Give Your Children 

## 1. Immunizations 

## Staying caught up on all your child's immunizations (/English/safety

## prevention/immunizations/Pages/Recommended-Immunization-Schedules.aspx) is one of the most 

## powerful ways you can shield your child from a variety of dangerous, infectious diseases. They train your 

## child's immune system to stop a variety of villainous germs that once sickened and killed thousands of 

## people each year. In addition to routine childhood immunizations, families can now fight COVID-19 with 

## vaccines available (/English/health-issues/conditions/COVID-19/Pages/The-Science-Behind-the-COVID

## 19-Vaccine-Parent-FAQs.aspx) for teens age 12 and up. They're expected to be available for younger teens 

## and children soon. 

## 2. Resilience 


### Some stress is just part of life, but when it's severe or ongoing, it can morph into “toxic stress." Toxic stress 

### can actually change the way children's brains and bodies develop. But you can help your children 

### develop the power of resilience, the ability to cope with and bounce back from stressful experiences 

### (/English/healthy-living/emotional-wellness/Building-Resilience/Pages/ACEs-Adverse-Childhood

### Experiences.aspx). Help them gain confidence in their abilities, for example, and build a network of 

### strong, supportive relationships–with you, and with other adults and peers. Think of it as their personal 

### legion of allies. 

## 3. Empathy 

### You may not be able to give your child telepathic abilities, but helping them build empathy can be a 

### powerful tool in life. Empathy is the ability to understand someone else's thoughts, feelings and 

### experiences. It helps children connect and relate to others in positive ways, which can reduce stress. It 

### even helps prevent harmful bias (/English/healthy-living/emotional-wellness/Building

### Resilience/Pages/Talking-to-Children-About-Racial-Bias.aspx) and racism. Reading (/English/healthy

### living/emotional-wellness/Building-Resilience/Pages/using-books-to-talk-with-kids-about-race-and

### racism.aspx) with your child is one way to help build empathy.

### Physical activity (/english/healthy-living/fitness/StopWatch-Tool/pages/default.aspx) and exercise has a 

### mighty effect on children's bodies and brains. It builds strong muscles and bones, coordination and 

### flexibility. It also helps combat rising rates of childhood obesity, which can lead to diabetes and heart 

### disease. Physical activity also reduces stress, boosts mood and helps children focus at school. The 

### American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that kids 6 years and older get 60 minutes of moderate to 

### vigorous physical activity on most days of the week. 

## 5. Earth Awareness 

### Give your children the knowledge that they can literally help save the planet! Nurture a respect for 

### nature by spending time outdoors when possible. Discuss (/English/safety-prevention/all

### around/Pages/Talking-with-Children-about-Climate-Change.aspx) news they hear about climate

### communities and nations have tools to take climate action right now, and using them can have
