# Sibling Synergy: Building Healthy Relationships at Home 

## The past couple years has certainly brought more time 

## at home together—maybe a little too much 

## togetherness for some siblings! However, it's an 

## opportunity to cultivate strong, supportive 

## relationships between your children. 

## Siblings are not only family but also each other's first 

## peers. While it is completely natural for siblings' 

## relationships to change over time (sometimes even by 

## the hour), the bond between your children is an 

## important foundation of their emotional well-being. 

## They can learn many things about relationships from 

## each other, including how to work through conflict, how 

## to show support, how to show respect and how to appreciate differences. 

## Making family time a priority 

## Because every family is unique and schedules can be challenging, time together can take whatever form works best 

## for your family. Here are some ways you can make family time a priority. 

## Enjoy family meals together 

## Sitting down to eat together once daily goes a long way. Try to make this a screen-free zone (/English/family

## life/Media/Pages/Adverse-Effects-of-Television-Commercials.aspx) to encourage conversation and a focus on each 

## other. This is a great opportunity in a relaxed, unpressured environment to vent, to connect, to communicate with 

## each other, to problem-solve together and to share frustrations. This is a wonderful way not only to help guide and 

## direct our kids but to model for our kids how to get along in the world. 

## If you have trouble getting children to talk about their days, try asking a simple question to start the conversation. 

## Everyone at the table can take turns answering questions such as "What was the best part of your day today?" or 

## "What is one thing you are grateful for today?" No matter how the conversation goes, it will help you touch base with 

## your children and find out how they are doing. Children can learn to take time to listen to each other as well. They 

## may have nothing to say at first. Be patient and keep trying. It may take time to find out what types of questions 

## interest them. 

## Depending on your children's ages, you can extend this time together into activities both before and after the meal. 

## Consider shopping for groceries, preparing the food, or cleaning up afterward together. Younger children can help 

## pick recipes, rinse fruits and vegetables, and set the table, while older siblings can take a turn at the stove or prepare 

## more difficult ingredients. 

## Add game night to your week 

## Game night can be fun at any age. If your kids struggle with sibling rivalry, pick teamwork-based games or don't keep 

## score. Change games to match your children's interests and strengths. 

## You can also get creative and create a scavenger hunt or challenge the kids to work together to create a mash-up of 

## multiple games with new rules. You can even take game night online with other family members and friends. For a 

## budget-friendly way to try new board games, many local libraries carry some that can be checked out. 

## Seek out family volunteer opportunities 

## Many organizations have family-based volunteer opportunities. Packaging meals or collecting supplies for those in 

## need are easy ways that you can work together to support local nonprofits. Think about your children's interests. Do 

## they love to draw? Consider making cards for a local senior center. Do you knit? Pass along a stress-relieving skill 

## while knitting baby blankets for a women's shelter. Love animals? Gather materials for a nearby animal shelter. Create

### a community service calendar for your family, and let your children each pick a cause to support for a month or a 

### quarter. You are not only teaching your children about the impact of community service but encouraging them to 

### support each other's interests and passions as well. 

## Tackle a home project together 

### Pick a home project that has meaningful tasks for each of your children. Little ones will love to be in charge of 

### gathering supplies, while older children and teens will have the opportunity to learn some hands-on life skills. Set 

### yourself up for a positive experience by making sure to set aside ample time in case someone needs to take a break, so 

### you have time to teach or for that extra trip to the hardware store. 

## Take turns choosing activities 

### Often, our kids' interests vary widely. It can be easy to cater to a younger or less mature child because the other sibling 

### "understands" or has better coping skills. Unfortunately, this can create resentment and doesn't allow kids to develop 

### skills for interacting with other children at school and play. Take turns focusing on activities that each child enjoys. 

## Recognize when to let them work it out 

### No matter how well you model behavior or how many game nights you plan, siblings are going to fight. What kids 

### disagree about will vary by age. A younger child, for example, may get upset when their sibling wants a favorite toy. 

### When they are teens, it may be because someone feels as if their privacy is being ignored. 

### Learning to disagree respectfully is part of developing effective communication and building coping skills, but 

### children need help along the way. Each child's temperament, maturity, and age play a large role in how they handle 

### disagreements. So when should you get involved as a parent? 

### With younger siblings, you will need to intervene more often. With toddlers, for example, you will need to 

### consistently repeat simple rules, such as the importance of sharing or not hitting. As your children get older and 

### become more mature, you can lessen your involvement. Always make sure your family's ground rules are clear. This 

### can include not hitting, entering someone's bedroom only with permission, and saying only kind things to each other. 

### If it is a simple disagreement, give them a chance to solve it on their own, even if they have to keep apart from each 

### other for a while first. During an argument, recognizing when you need time to process is a valuable skill. 

### If the siblings don't seem able to reach a resolution on their own or you are concerned about a child's well-being, 

### whether physical or emotional, step in as a calm, neutral party. Do your best to listen fairly before making any 

### decisions. Even if you know someone is at fault, taking the time to listen and to remain calm reinforces their own 

### behavior in the future. 

## Create one-on-one time 

### While time together as a family is important, one-on-one time with each child is important too. Try fitting it into your 

### daily routines, such as during a nightly chat at bedtime, or each child can take turns walking the dog with you. If time 

### allows, schedule special activities such as a monthly breakfast alone or a quarterly afternoon with an activity of their 

### choice. These are times for you to truly tune in to them and for your child to know they have your full attention— 

### without the distraction of their siblings—and to know their thoughts are important to you. Special time also gives you 

### as the parent an opportunity to more fully enjoy your children and to appreciate their voices, humor, and interests 

### without distractions. 

### Keep in mind, how our kids interact begins with how we as parents interact with our families. By being mindful of our 

### actions, we can help our kids develop strong, lifelong relationships with their siblings that are built on respect, 

### understanding, and appreciation of their unique personalities.
