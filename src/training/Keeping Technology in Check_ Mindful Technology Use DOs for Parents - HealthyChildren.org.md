# Keeping Technology in Check: Mindful Technology Use 

# DOs for Parents 

## By: David L. Hill, MD, FAAP 

## If there's one thing that kids and parents can agree on, it's that no 

## one likes being told what not to do. Don't splash, don't play with your 

## food, don't underfund your 401-K, it's all just a drag. This is a 

## message that we at the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) have 

## heard loud and clear, especially when it comes to kids and 

## technology. "Don't let your child watch television. Don't give your 

## baby an iPhone." Parents respond, "I'd love to listen to you, but I'm 

## busy right now funding my 401-K. And playing with my food." 

## That's why our newer media guidelines focus much less on what 

## parents should avoid than on what they should encourage. Do co

## view programs with your children. Do read up on apps and games your kids might use. Do have a family conversation 

## about where media fits into your lives and how you're going to make time for other activities. 

## If there is one overarching "do" on the list, it's do make mindful choices about technology use and your children. Will 

## handing your toddler an iPhone while you pay for groceries permanently stunt her development? Probably not, but be 

## aware that new research further reinforces the relationship between media use in young children and delayed 

## learning of language skills. It's not like it happens instantly, but if you find that you can't go to the grocery store 

## without handing her a phone, it's time to reconsider. 

## Likewise, if you're going to acquire a new device for one of your children — be it a smartphone, a tablet, or a gaming 

## system — ask yourself ahead of time what the purpose of this device is and what rules you want to establish around its 

## use. The AAP suggests, for example, that devices not come to the dinner table or stay in kids' bedrooms overnight. 

## Kids do need conversation around the dinner table, and they do need a solid night's sleep to be at their best. An easy 

## way to structure this conversation is to use the AAP's Family Media Use Plan tool (/English/media/Pages/default.aspx). 

## As your kids grow older their needs change, as do your family's. A laptop that may have previously been used 

## primarily for Minecraft becomes a mandatory tool for completing homework assignments. A social network that was 

## mainly for posting funny pictures becomes the main tool for planning nights out and keeping track of who said what 

## to whom during the school day. 

## At this point do take time to ask what's happening online. For our kids, the online world and the "real" world are all the 

## same thing. Even an activity as pointless-seeming as a video game often brings our kids together with their school 

## friends to form online teams, where the dynamics of the lunchroom and the playground continue to play out on a 

## strategic map running on a server farm somewhere in the desert. 

## So do ask questions. Do feel empowered to structure rules around media use, just as you would about food, safety, and 

## sleep. And do occasionally play with your food. You're a grown up, who's going to stop you?
