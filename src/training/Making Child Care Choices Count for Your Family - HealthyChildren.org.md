# Making Child Care Choices Count for Your Family 

## For more and more parents, making the child care decision is not a simple choice. Along with 

## weighing your child’s needs, there are three main types of child care to think about. There is no 

## simple formula for choosing the right child care provider for your child. However, learning as 

## much as you can about your options can help you decide what is best for your family. 

## What Type for Your Child? 

## There are three basic types of child care: 

## In-home care: A caregiver comes into your home and supervises your child there. 

## Family child care: Child caregivers provide their service out of their own homes. 

## Center-based care: Child care organizations feature structured activities and programs, as well as a trained staff. 

## Choosing the right option for your family comes down to thinking about the pros and cons of each type. 

## In-Home Care 

## For some families, the most convenient option is having the caregiver come to your own home. In some cases, 

## caregivers may even live in the family home. The advantages to this approach include the potential for your child to 

## receive more individual attention, limited exposure to seasonal ailments such as colds and the flu, and your child’s 

## comfort level with a familiar place. 

## There are challenges to having an inhome caregiver, however. For starters, skilled in-home providers are not easy to 

## find. If you do find one, realize that both the caregiver and child need clear rules about what your expectations are. 

## These rules should include how to discipline the child in your absence; how much TV time (if any) is OK; what 

## activities you want your child to take part in (reading, playtime, etc.); and when it’s OK to take your child on an outing. 

## An in-home caregiver should be willing to provide a complete daily schedule and report of your child’s activities, and 

## to make use of positive, effective methods of discipline. Even so, it’s not easy to know for sure what your child’s 

## caregiver is doing when you’re not there. That’s why frequent, unannounced visits from friends or family members 

## are a good idea. 

## Keep in mind that you’ll need to have a backup plan in place for those times when your child’s caregiver is sick, needs 

## personal time, or is on vacation. 

## Family Child Care 

## Some child care providers work out of their own homes, often supervising other children alongside their own. These 

## family child care providers are usually not as convenient for parents as in-home care. But they can sometimes provide 

## a more focused, home-like environment than center-based care and are usually easier to find than in-home 

## caregivers. 

## If you are thinking about a family child care situation, there are some questions you will want to ask: 

## What are the caregiver’s policies and qualifications? Is he or she licensed or registered with the state, or 

## accredited by a recognized child care organization? 

## What kind of program does the caregiver provide, and what condition is the caregiver’s home in? 

## Are there other children, teens, or adults in the home besides the caregiver? If so, who are they, what are their 

## backgrounds, and how will they be involved in the care of your child? 


### The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that a family child care business have no more than six children 

### per adult caregiver (including the caregiver’s own children), with no more than two of those children younger than 2 

### years old. However, be aware that state regulations often allow for more children per caregiver. Also, make sure that 

### you have a backup plan. If your caregiver is sick or unavailable, or in case of emergencies, you’ll need a fallback option 

### since usually only one adult is providing the care. Ask the provider if he or she belongs to a local network that can 

### provide support if needed. 

## Center-Based Care 

### Child care centers are widely available. Some are independently owned, while others are sponsored by churches, 

### employers, schools, or government agencies or programs, such as Head Start. Whether it’s called a child care center, 

### preschool, nursery school, learning center, or something similar, it serves the same basic function: providing care for 

### children at a central location. 

### Regardless of who sponsors it or what it is called, a child care center should be licensed and inspected on a regular 

### basis for health, safety, cleanliness, staffing, and program content. Many states license child care centers, but these 

### regulations set only the minimum standards for operating — and some types of child care operation may be exempt 

### under the law. Either way, be sure that what the center offers meets not only the state’s standards but also your 

### expectations for appropriate care for your child. 

### As with family-based care, written policies and safety guidelines should be available for your review. 

## What You Need to Consider 

### A good place to start your search for a quality child care option is to contact a reliable information resource, such as 

### Child Care Aware (1-800-424-2246). This organization can provide helpful information and contacts to steer you 

### toward locally available child care in your community. 

### Get a list of child care providers in your community, then call them and ask for information about who they are and 

### what they offer. As you review those materials, write down the questions you want to ask them when you call them 

### back. 

### Here are a few things you want to think about in choosing a child care provider: 

### Location: Is the provider near your home or workplace? Can a parent get there quickly in case of emergency? 

### Hours: When is the operation open to parents? What is their policy regarding parents who are late picking up 

### their children? 

### Licensing and accreditation: Is the facility licensed with the state, or accredited by a recognized professional 

### child care association? 

### Inspections and consultations: Does the program have a qualified health professional such as a doctor or a nurse 

### who serves as consultant? Keep in mind that the national standard is for centerbased child care facilities to be 

### visited by a health professional at least monthly, with all others to receive quarterly visits. 

### Policies: Does the provider welcome parent visits during normal operating hours, including after enrollment? 

### Can you inspect the areas your child will use? What is the sick child policy? Are the center’s policies available in 

### writing, and are they consistent with your own? 

### Staff: What is the caregiver’s educational and professional background? Has he or she received any outside 

### training from qualified experts in the past year? Is CPR/First Aid training required of the staff? How many 

### trained adults are available for the children there? Are there enough staff members per number of children, and 

### is the staffing sufficient to cover absences? 

### Availability: Does the center keep reasonable hours, given your schedule? Do you have access to the caregiver 

### during the day or by phone on a regular basis? 

### Once you’ve narrowed your list down, visit the providers you’re considering and notice how they operate. Note any 

### concerns you have about: 

### How children are treated 

### How clean the facilities are 

### Whether the food seems to be nutritious and well prepared 

### How safe the rooms are

### How much space is available for activities 

### Whether the children and caregiver(s) there seem happy 

### Any other such measures of quality child care 

### With some very worthwhile homework, you can rest assured that you’ve made the right child care decision for your 

### child and your family.
