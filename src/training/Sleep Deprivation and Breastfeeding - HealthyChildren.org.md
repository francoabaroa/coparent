# Sleep Deprivation and Breastfeeding 

## My baby is four weeks old, and already I feel like I’m 

## suffering from extreme sleep deprivation. How can I 

## breastfeed on demand and still get enough sleep? 

## Keep your baby close by the bed in her own bassinet. With your baby beside you, you need only 

## roll over, pick her up, and place her next to you to breastfeed (/English/ages

## stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Where-We-Stand-Breastfeeding.aspx). If your husband is 

## willing to change the baby’s diaper when necessary, you can fall back asleep once a nursing session is over. 

## Also, try to develop the habit (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Establishing-a-Breastfeeding

## Routine.aspx) of sleeping during the day when the baby sleeps. Some sleep deprivation 

## (/English/news/Pages/Breastfeeding-Moms-Dont-Get-Less-or-Worse-Sleep-Than-Moms-Who-Use-Formula-Study

## Finds.aspx) is always part of the process of early parenting, but breastfeeding certainly disrupts sleep less than getting 

## up and preparing a bottle of formula. And soon your baby will sleep for longer intervals.
