## Question 

# With the baby formula shortage, what should I do if I can't 

# find any? 

## Steven A. Abrams, MD, FAAP 

## Answer 

## Since the outbreak of COVID-19 (/English/health

## issues/conditions/chest-lungs/Pages/2019-Novel

## Coronavirus.aspx), there have been significant shortages 

## of infant formulas (/English/ages-stages/baby/formula

## feeding/Pages/default.aspx) nationwide. Current 

## shortages have been largely caused by supply chain 

## issues and the recent recall (/English/tips-tools/ask-the

## pediatrician/Pages/What-should-I-know-about-the

## infant-formula-recall.aspx) of several baby formula 

## products over contamination concerns. 

## Here are some tips on finding baby formula during the shortage, and what you may safely consider if you absolutely 

## can't find any. 

## Keep in mind, this advice is strictly during this current URGENT formula shortage. If you have any concerns 

## about your baby's nutrition, please talk with your pediatrician. 

## What if baby formula is out of stock everywhere I look? 

## Call your pediatrician if you can't formula you need for your baby. They may have samples in stock, connections to 

## other local organizations or ideas of other places to call, such as your local WIC (https://www.wicprogram.net/find

## wic-clinic-near-me) clinic. Also consider: 

## If you can afford it, buy formula online until store shortages ease. Purchase from well-recognized distributors, 

## grocers, and pharmacies rather than individually sold or auction sites. 

## Check social media groups. There are groups dedicated to infant feeding and formula, and members may have 

## ideas for where to find formula. Make sure to check any advice with your pediatrician. 

## This formula crisis is hitting families who are already grappling with stresses of parenting young children in a 

## pandemic. It can be tempting to buy as much formula as possible right now, but the American Academy of 

## Pediatrics (AAP) advises buying no more than a 10-day to 2-week supply of formula to help ease shortages.

## I found small amounts of several different baby formulas. What is 

## the best way to switch among the brands? 

#### For most babies, it is OK to switch to any available formula, including store brands. It is likely that your baby will do 

#### just fine with different formulas as long as they are the same type (/English/ages-stages/baby/formula

#### feeding/Pages/Choosing-an-Infant-Formula.aspx). (The exception would be if they are on certain specialty formulas 

#### for medical reasons. Read more below.) If your baby does not like the taste or has a hard time tolerating a different 

#### formula, you may want to try gradually introducing small amounts of the new formula mixed with the usual formula. 

#### Slowly increase the amount of the new formula. 

#### Be patient, since it may take some time for your baby to get used to a new formula. If you have questions about 

#### whether your baby is tolerating the new formula, call your pediatrician. 

## My infant needs a specialty metabolic baby formula, but I can't find 

## any. What should I do? 

#### Abbott is releasing limited quantities of Similac PM 60/40 and other metabolic or amino-acid formulas for babies in 

#### urgent need. Your pediatrician's office can fill out a request and, if it is approved, the formula can be shipped to your 

#### home. Talk to your pediatrician about safe, comparable specialty formulas (/English/ages-stages/baby/formula

#### feeding/Pages/Choosing-an-Infant-Formula.aspx)for your baby. 

## Only one brand of baby formula is covered under the WIC program, 

## but I can't find any. What should I do? 

#### Most states are allowing parents who use WIC benefits to buy other brands of baby formula or different sizes and 

#### forms like ready-to-feed formula. To find out what your state is allowing, you can check this map. 

#### (https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/infant-formula-waiver-status) 

## I have a 3-month-old infant and can't find my usual baby formula. 

## What should I do? 

#### This is a very difficult problem. If you can find another similar formula, it's OK to make the switch. If you use a special 

#### formula for allergies or other special health needs, the North American Society For Pediatric Gastroenterology, 

#### Hepatology & Nutrition provides a list of comparable formulas here (https://naspghan.org/recent-news/naspghan

#### tools-for-hcps-affected-by-formula-recall/). 

## Can I add extra water to formula and give my baby a multivitamin to 

## make up the nutrients? 

#### This should never be done. Adding extra water (/English/ages-stages/baby/formula-feeding/Pages/how-to-safely

#### prepare-formula-with-water.aspx)to formula can dilute the levels of protein and minerals, and lead to low sodium 

#### levels in the blood and other electrolyte disorders that may require hospitalization. Always follow label instructions or 

#### those given to you by your pediatrician. 

## Can I make my own baby formula? I've seen a recipe online using 

## evaporated milk that people say was used safely in the 1940s. 

#### Evaporated milk, also known as unsweetened condensed milk, is a form of concentrated milk. Mixing it with water can 

#### cause contamination or an incorrect balance of nutrients. 

#### For similar reasons, AAP does not recommend using homemade baby formula (/English/ages-stages/baby/formula

#### feeding/Pages/Is-Homemade-Baby-Formula-Safe.aspx). Although homemade formula was used in the past, it also 

#### came with many risks to infants. Online recipes for homemade baby formula have significant safety concerns 

##### Back to Top 


#### regarding contamination and nutrient concentration. Using homemade baby formula can harm your infant. Some 

#### babies have been hospitalized from reported use of homemade formulas. 

## What is the earliest age I can start giving my baby solid food to 

## stretch my formula supply? 

#### Solid foods should not be used to stretch baby formula supply. Formula contains all of the nutrients 

#### (https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?fr=107.100) young babies need, while solid 

#### foods may not. Infants generally are ready to eat solid food when they are about 6 months old, but it depends on their 

#### stage of development. Talk with your pediatrician about when your baby may be ready for solid foods. 

## Is it safe to get breast milk from a friend or online group? 

#### We can't know for sure whether breast milk from a friend or online group is safe (/English/news/Pages/New-AAP

#### Recommendations-Aim-to-Ensure-Safe-Donor-Human-Milk-Available-for-High-Risk-Infants-Who.aspx). It is better 

#### to check with a local milk bank that is accredited through the Human Milk Banking Association of North America. To 

#### find an accredited milk bank, check here (https://www.hmbana.org/find-a-milk-bank/). 

## I heard the government is importing baby formula from other 

## countries. Is that safe? 

#### The Food & Drug Administration (FDA (https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-encourages

#### importation-safe-infant-formula-and-other-flexibilities-further-increase-availability)) is working to verify safe 

#### production standards, labeling and shipping of some imported baby formula brands not previously sold in the United 

#### States. European baby formulas are regulated by the European Food Safety Agency similar to how the FDA regulates 

#### U.S. formula, and are highly reliable. 

#### The most important safety consideration if using imported formulas is to read the label carefully. Many imported 

#### formulas use milliliter (ml) rather than ounce (oz) in the mixing directions. If your baby bottles don’t have ml scale 

#### markings, you may have to convert (https://www.fda.gov/media/158832/download)from ounces to milliliters. Too 

#### much or too little water used with powder or concentrate is dangerous for your baby. 

#### It is also important to select the right imported formula for your baby’s age. Imported formulas may be labeled as 

#### "Stage 1" (for the first six months after birth, but generally can be used throughout the first year), and "Stage 2" (just for 

#### babies who are over 6 months of age). 

## Can toddler "formula" substitute for regular baby formula? 

#### Toddler drinks, often found in the formula aisles, are not recommended for infants. However, if you absolutely have no 

#### other choice, these products can be safe for a few days for babies who are close to a year of age. 

## Can I give my full-term baby premature formula? 

#### Formulas designed for babies who were born premature (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Providing

#### Breastmilk-for-Premature-and-Ill-Newborns.aspx) (and have "catch-up" growth to do) can safely be used for a few 

#### weeks to feed full-term babies if nothing else is available. 

## Is cow's milk a safe alternative to baby formula? 

#### If your child is older than 6 months of age and is usually on regular formula (not a specialty product for allergies or 

#### other special health needs), this may be an option. In a pinch, you could feed them whole cow's milk (/English/ages

#### stages/baby/formula-feeding/Pages/Why-Formula-Instead-of-Cows-Milk.aspx) for a brief period of time (no more 

#### than a week). 

##### Back to Top 


#### This is not ideal and should not be done for more than one week. One concern with giving cow's milk to a baby who 

#### is 7-12 months old on a long-term basis is that it does not contain enough iron (/English/ages-stages/baby/formula

#### feeding/Pages/choosing-an-infant-formula.aspx). This can lead to anemia (/English/health

#### issues/conditions/chronic/Pages/Anemia-and-Your-Child.aspx). If you have to use cow's milk to feed your infant, 

#### ideally do so for as short a time as possible. It's also important to give your baby plenty of iron-containing solid foods, 

#### such as baby food made with meat or iron-fortified cereals. 

#### If you need to give your baby whole cow's milk for a week during the shortage, talk with your pediatrician. 

## What about feeding my baby goat's milk? 

#### Remember that raw goat's milk, like raw cow's milk, is not safe for a baby since it has not been pasteurized to kill 

#### harmful bacteria. But some goat milk-based baby formulas made in other countries are among those being imported 

#### and distributed in the United States to help ease the national shortage. These are considered safe. 

## Can I use plant-based milk instead of baby formula if needed? 

#### Plant-based milk alternatives generally are not recommended for babies under a year of age. Soy milk may be an 

#### option to give babies who are close a year old during the shortage, but not for more than one week. If you can't find 

#### formula and have to use soy milk, be sure to buy the kind that is fortified with calcium and vitamin D. Make sure to 

#### change back to formula as soon as some is available. Be especially careful to avoid almond milk or other plant milks 

#### (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Milk-Allergy-Foods-and-Ingredients-to-Avoid.aspx) as these are often low in 

#### protein and minerals. Talk with your pediatrician if you are considering using plant-based milk. 

## How long can baby formula be used past a "best by" date? 

#### Generally, formula should not be used past the "best by" date because it may no longer be safe or have the required 

#### levels of nutrients. 

## Remember 

#### This is a stressful and scary time for families. Your pediatrician is a resource who can help advise on the best and 

#### safest ways to feed formula-fed formula babies during the shortage.
