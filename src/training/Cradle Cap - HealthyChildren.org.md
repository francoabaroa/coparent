# Cradle Cap 

## Your beautiful one-month-old baby has developed scaliness 

## and redness on his scalp. You're concerned and think maybe 

## you shouldn't shampoo as usual. You also notice some redness 

## in the creases of his neck and armpits and behind his ears. 

## What is it and what should you do? 

## When this rash occurs on the scalp alone, it's known as cradle cap. 

## But although it may start as scaling and redness of the scalp, it also 

## can be found later in the other areas just mentioned. It can extend 

## to the face and diaper area, too, and when it does, pediatricians call 

## it seborrheic dermatitis (because it occurs where there are the 

## greatest number of oil producing sebaceous glands). Seborrheic 

## dermatitis is a noninfectious skin condition that's very common in infants, usually beginning in the first weeks of life 

## and slowly disappearing over a period of weeks or months. Unlike eczema (/English/health

## issues/conditions/skin/Pages/Eczema.aspx) or contact dermatitis, it's rarely uncomfortable or itchy. 

## What Causes Cradle Cap? 

## No one knows for sure the exact cause of this rash. Some doctors have speculated that it may be influenced by the 

## mother's hormonal changes during pregnancy, which stimulate the infant's oil glands. This overproduction of oil may 

## have some relationship to the scales and redness of the skin. 

## How to Treat Your Baby's Cradle Cap 

## If your baby's seborrheic dermatitis is confined to his scalp (and is, therefore, just cradle cap), you can treat it yourself. 

## Don't be afraid to shampoo the hair ; in fact, you should wash it (/English/ages-stages/baby/bathing-skin

## care/Pages/To-Bathe-or-Not-to-Bathe.aspx) (with a mild baby shampoo) more frequently than before. This, along 

## with soft brushing, will help remove the scales. Stronger medicated shampoos (antiseborrhea shampoos 

## containing sulfur and 2 percent salicylic acid) may loosen the scales more quickly, but since they also can be 

## irritating, use them only after consulting your pediatrician. 

## Some parents have found using petroleum jelly or ointments beneficial. But baby oil is not very helpful or 

## necessary. In fact, while many parents tend to use unperfumed baby oil or mineral oil and do nothing else, doing 

## so allows scales to build up on the scalp, particularly over the soft spot on the back of the head, or fontanelle. 

## Your doctor also might prescribe a cortisone cream or lotion , such as 1 percent hydrocortisone cream. Once 

## the condition has improved, you can prevent it from recurring, in most cases, by continuing with frequent hair 

## washing with a mild baby shampoo. 

## Yeast Infections 

## Sometimes yeast infections occur on the affected skin, most likely in the crease areas rather than on the scalp. If this 

## occurs, the area will become extremely reddened and quite itchy. In this case, your pediatrician might prescribe a 

## medication such as an anti-yeast cream. 

## Outlook 

## Rest assured that seborrheic dermatitis is not a serious condition, or an infection. Nor is it an allergy to something 

## you're using, or due to poor hygiene. It will go away without any scars.
