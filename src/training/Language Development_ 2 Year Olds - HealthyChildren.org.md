# Language Development: 2 Year Olds 

## Your two-year-old not only understands most of what you say to him, but also speaks with a 

## rapidly growing vocabulary of fifty or more words. Over the course of this year, he’ll graduate 

## from twoor three-word sentences (“Drink juice,” “Mommy want cookie”) to those with four, five, 

## or even six words (“Where’s the ball, Daddy?” “Dolly sit in my lap”). He’s also beginning to use 

## pronouns (I, you, me, we, they) and understands the concept of “mine” (“I want my cup,” “I see 

## my mommy”). Pay attention to how he also is using language to describe ideas and information 

## and to express his physical or emotional needs and desires. 

## It’s human nature to measure your toddler’s verbal abilities against those of other children his 

## age, but you should try to avoid this. At this time, there’s more variation in language development than in any other 

## area. While some preschoolers develop language skills at a steady rate, others seem to master words in an uneven 

## manner. And some children are naturally more talkative than others. This doesn’t mean that the more verbal children 

## are necessarily smarter or more advanced than the quieter ones, nor does it even mean that they have richer 

## vocabularies. In fact, the quiet child may know just as many words but be choosier about speaking them. As a general 

## rule, boys start talking later than girls, but this variation—like most others mentioned above—tends to even out as 

## children reach school age. 

## Without any formal instruction, just by listening and practicing, your child will master many of the basic rules of 

## grammar by the time she enters school. You can help enrich his vocabulary and language skills by making reading a 

## part of your everyday routine. At this age, he can follow a story line and will understand and remember many ideas 

## and pieces of information presented in books. Even so, because he may have a hard time sitting still for too long, the 

## books you read to him should be short. To keep his attention, choose activity-oriented books that encourage him to 

## touch, point, and name objects or to repeat certain phrases. Toward the end of this year, as his language skills become 

## more advanced, he’ll also have fun with poems, puns, or jokes that play with language by repeating funny sounds or 

## using nonsense phrases. 

## For some children, however, this language-development process does not run smoothly. In fact, about one in every ten 

## to fifteen children has trouble with language comprehension and/or speech. For some children, the problem is caused 

## by hearing difficulty, low intelligence, lack of verbal stimulation at home, or a family history of speech delays. In most 

## cases, though, the cause is unknown. If your pediatrician suspects your child has difficulty with language, he’ll 

## conduct a thorough physical exam and hearing test and, if necessary, refer you to a speech/language or early

## childhood specialist for further evaluation. Early detection and identification of language delay or hearing 

## impairment is critically important, so treatment can begin before the problem interferes with learning in other areas. 

## Unless you and your pediatrician identify the difficulty and do something about it, your child may have continuous 

## trouble with classroom learning.
