# Social and Environmental Obstacles During Toilet Training 

## If your child’s pediatrician has ruled out physical causes for your child’s problems with toilet use, it is time to consider 

## possible environmental factors. Your child’s daily interactions with you and other adults, as well as her siblings and 

## peers, can have a decided effect on her bathroom behavior. Issues centering around child care can create 

## complications, for example—particularly when both parents work full time and the child is cared for by other adults 

## for long periods of time. 

## Sometimes the difficulty is caused by conflicting attitudes among the adults involved in monitoring bathroom 

## behavior. Perhaps you have no problem with the fact that your four-year-old is not yet toilet-trained, while his baby

## sitter resents having to change diapers. Or you may be battling a recent rash of accidents by keeping your child on a 

## regular bathroom schedule at home, only to find that she’s wet her pants at school because she wasn’t sent to the 

## bathroom after lunch. 

## Finding a solution to such problems requires discussing what is happening with all the adults involved in your child’s 

## care. Describe any problems and the plans you have created to solve them. Solicit the other adults’ opinions about 

## these plans, and listen to their objections or suggestions. Then come to an agreement about a course of action, so that 

## your child will meet with a consistent response everywhere she goes. Ideally, because you are the parent, your 

## decision should be the final one, but there may be times when it’s more practical or productive to follow another 

## caregiver’s lead. If the child-care center schedules five bathroom visits a day, for example, you can schedule visits to 

## the home bathroom at the same times. 

## Be sure to follow up such discussions by asking for feedback about how the techniques used seem to be affecting your 

## child. If she is increasingly resisting a rigid bathroom schedule, it may be better to allow her to choose when she goes 

## —even at her child-care center or preschool. If her accidents seem to occur when she is engrossed in story hour, 

## perhaps she can be taken to the bathroom before the story begins. 

## No matter how embarrassing you believe your child’s problem is, it is necessary to seek out this kind of support. Rest 

## assured that caregivers are accustomed to dealing with everything from fecal soiling to genital exploration to 

## frequent experiments with potty talk. There is little your child can do that will shock or even surprise a professional 

## caregiver or educator. By asking for their support and advice, you may receive some welcome support for your own 

## efforts as well. 

## Multiple Households 

## Problems stemming from inconsistent or conflicting approaches to bathroom use may also arise for children who 

## move between two separate homes—usually as a result of parents’ separation or divorce. Again, it is vital to 

## communicate with the other parent about the rules and routines you intend to maintain. Such negotiations can be 

## much more difficult in this case, of course, since both parents have equal authority and may have sharply divergent 

## opinions. Still, it is important for your child’s sake to keep the bathroom routine as consistent as possible between the 

## two homes—using the same type of potty when possible, for example, and keeping it in the same room in each home— 

## and to respond to new challenges as a team. 

## Travel 

## A change in environment caused by a vacation or other travel is another common cause of bathroom-related 

## problems among young children. Travel plans that call for a break in a child’s routine, or that take the child away from 

## a familiar bathroom or potty, may create anxiety that then leads to accidents or constipation. While most such 

## responses are only temporary and disappear once the child is used to the new routine or has returned to the old one, 

## some lead to negative learned behavior, such as withholding stool or delaying urination, that takes weeks or months to 

## correct. 

## To avoid such complications, it’s best to keep your child’s bathroom experience while traveling as similar as possible 

## to the routine he follows at home. If you are traveling by car, consider taking your child’s potty along. When flying, 

## take your child to the bathroom at the airport before you board the plane, and bring along familiar stuffed animals or

## other favorite objects that may make public or hotel bathrooms less frightening. Plan to accompany your child to the 

## bathroom and expect to prompt him toward bathroom use more than if you were not traveling.
