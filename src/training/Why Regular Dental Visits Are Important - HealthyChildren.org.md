# Why Regular Dental Visits Are Important 

## Visiting the dentist regularly has many benefits, such as: 

## Promoting Good Oral Health 

## During dental visits, oral health providers ask questions to learn 

## about the pregnant woman’s and parents’ oral health practices. For 

## example, they may ask if the pregnant woman or child 

## drinks fluoridated tap water (/English/healthy-living/oral

## health/Pages/Water-Fluoridation.aspx) or snacks frequently or if 

## parents give the child a bottle filled with something other than 

## water at bedtime (See Where We Stand: Fruit Juice 

## (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Where-We-Stand-Fruit-Juice.aspx) ). This information can help oral health 

## providers deliver care and provide education to make it less likely that the woman or child will have problems later. 

## Teaching Children to Value Good Oral Health 

## Early dental visits (/English/healthy-living/oral-health/Pages/First-Steps-to-a-Healthy-Smile.aspx)teach a child that 

## oral health is important. A child who is taken for dental visits early in life is more likely to have a good attitude about 

## oral health providers and dental visits. Pregnant women who get oral health care are also more likely to take their 

## child to get care. 

## Finding Oral Health Problems Early 

## One goal of dental visits is finding problems early. Tooth decay (/English/healthy-living/oral-health/Pages/Preventing

## Tooth-Decay-in-Children.aspx) can be stopped or managed if it is caught early. Treating problems early keeps oral 

## diseases from getting worse and costs less than treatment would later. Treating disease early is also important 

## because oral disease can be transmitted from mother to baby through saliva.
