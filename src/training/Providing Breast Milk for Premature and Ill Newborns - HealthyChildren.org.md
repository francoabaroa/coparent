# Providing Breast Milk for Premature and Ill Newborns 

## Providing breast milk for a premature or seriously ill 

## newborn may be a challenge, but it is usually possible 

## and it is certainly an effective way to enhance your 

## baby's health, growth, and development. Even if your 

## baby is unable to breastfeed at first, you can begin 

## expressing your milk immediately after giving birth. 

## When your baby is stable, you can have the milk fed to 

## them by a tube or by letting them sip the milk from a 

## tiny cup or bottle. 

## No matter how your breast milk is delivered to them, it 

## provides the best nourishment possible at a time when 

## it can make a big difference. 

## How premature breast milk meets your baby's special needs 

## Mothers of premature babies (/english/ages-stages/baby/preemie/Pages/default.aspx) produce breast milk that is 

## slightly different in composition, at least for the first several weeks. This difference is designed to meet your baby's 

## particular needs. Premature breast milk is higher in protein and minerals, such as salt, and contains different types of 

## fat that your baby can more easily digest and absorb. 

## The fat in human milk helps to enhance the development of a baby's brain and neurologic tissues, which is especially 

## important for premature infants. Human milk is easier for them to digest than formula. It also avoids exposing their 

## immature intestinal lining to the cow's milk proteins that are found in baby formula created for premature infants. 

## Premature babies who are breastfed are less likely to develop intestinal infections than are babies who are formula

## fed. The breast milk you produce in the first few days contains high concentrations of antibodies to help your baby 

## fight infection (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Breastfeeding-Benefits-Your-Babys-Immune

## System.aspx). Even if your baby cannot breastfeed yet, expressing breast milk from the beginning will ensure that 

## your milk supply is kept up until your baby is able to nurse. 

## Breastfeeding support for you and your preemie 

## Your first step in providing your baby with breast milk is to enlist the support of professionals on the medical team 

## who will care for your infant at the hospital. Notify your baby's pediatrician and neonatologist, if one is caring for your 

## baby, that you want to breastfeed and to provide your expressed breast milk for your baby. Your doctors can arrange to 

## have your expressed milk fed to your baby or for you to breastfeed your infant in the neonatal intensive care unit 

## (NICU). 

## Many hospitals now provide private areas for nursing and trained specialists to assist breastfeeding mothers. These 

## experienced members of your support team can show you how to assemble and use an electric breast pump, teach 

## you to express milk efficiently, and give you advice on storing breast milk (/English/ages

## stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Storing-and-Preparing-Expressed-Breast-Milk.aspx). As your baby gets more 

## mature, if you are able to directly breastfeed, they can help you adjust your nursing position to your infant's small size. 

## Many NICUs encourage parents to room-in continuously and keep the baby skin to skin (/English/ages

## stages/baby/preemie/pages/About-Skin-to-Skin-Care.aspx)(sometimes referred to as kangaroo care (/English/ages

## stages/baby/preemie/Pages/About-Skin-to-Skin-Care.aspx)), because this has been shown to be beneficial for stability 

## and optimal growth and development of premature babies. Breast milk pumping, or expression, immediately after 

## holding your baby skin-to-skin is a very effective way to increase your milk supply. Some mothers find pumping at 

## their baby's bedside in the NICU very helpful as well. 


## Expressing breast milk 

##### If your newborn is too small or ill to breastfeed at first, or if a birth condition prevents them from breastfeeding 

##### directly, a hospital-grade electric breast pump is an effective option to express milk and establish and maintain an 

##### adequate milk supply. Your hospital will provide you with a pump while you are there, and you can rent or purchase 

##### one to use at home later. 

##### The pump you use should create a milking action and not simply be a sucking device. Beginning as soon as possible 

##### after your baby's birth, express your milk at regular intervals, at approximately the times when your baby would 

##### usually feed. Aim to pump at least 6 to 8 times a day; this provides nipple stimulation and encourages milk production. 

##### You should pump at regular intervals throughout the night for the first few weeks, not going for more than 4 or 5 

##### hours without pumping. If you wake up each morning and your breasts feel full, then you are sleeping too long 

##### through the night; this fullness will actually decrease your milk production. 

## Maintaining your breast milk supply 

##### For mothers of preterm babies, the minimum amount of time to try to pump throughout a twenty-four-hour period is 

##### one hundred minutes. This much breast stimulation and milk expression is the minimum required to maintain breast 

##### milk supply over many weeks (if your baby is very small, premature, or ill). 

##### Using a double-pump setup lets you express milk from both breasts at the same time. Most women find that the 

##### double pump produces the most milk in the least amount of time. When using the pump, continue to pump for 

##### several minutes after your milk has stopped flowing to stimulate increased milk production. 

##### Breast massage before and during the use of the pump has been shown to improve your milk flow and may even boost 

##### your milk production. To do this, make small, circular motions with your fingertips, starting at the outer edges of your 

##### breast near the chest wall, and slowly make your way toward the center. The massage should always be gentle to avoid 

##### producing friction on the skin surface or massaging so deeply that it causes pain. 

### What to know about colostrum 

##### Keep in mind that you will express only small amounts of colostrum at first, but this immune-boosting substance is 

##### extremely beneficial for your baby. Some mothers find that expressing the colostrum by hand massage into a small 

##### cup or spoon is easier than using an electric pump in the first few days. Hand expression into a cup also allows you to 

##### save each drop, instead of losing milk that is trapped within the tubing of the pump. 

##### Once your milk supply increases, the amount of milk you can express will probably fluctuate from day to day. As a 

##### result, you will need to increase the number of times per day you express milk to maintain an optimal milk supply. 

##### These fluctuations are normal—just more easily observed when expressing milk than when breastfeeding. Once your 

##### baby begins breastfeeding, your milk production is likely to increase. To maximize your milk production, try to get as 

##### much rest as possible, take your prescribed pain medication, drink adequate fluids and minimize stress. 

## Feeding your your premature baby in the hospital 

##### Your breast milk can be fed to your baby through a tube that passes through their nose or mouth into their stomach or 

##### from a tiny cup or bottle. The feeding route will depend on the degree of prematurity of your infant and on the policies 

##### in the NICU at your hospital. 

##### Occasionally young infants fed by bottle may start to prefer the bottle, which delivers milk faster and with less effort 

#### than feeding at the breast. Some of these babies later refuse to breastfeed—a situation called nipple confusion or 

#### nipple preference. During this period when your baby is using an alternative feeding method, you can introduce them 

##### to breastfeeding by holding them skin to skin against your chest whenever possible and allowing them to nuzzle and 

##### suckle at your breast. This, of course, should be done only when the neonatologist or pediatrician has given approval. 

##### Soon you may be able to progress to a at-breast nursing supplementer or other device that will deliver your expressed 

##### breast milk from a bottle or syringe through a tiny tube that is taped next to your nipple. With this method, your baby 

##### should begin to feed partly from the tube and partly from your breast as they latch on to your breast and actively 

##### nurse. 

### Helping your baby latch on 

##### Early breastfeeding sessions will probably be more successful if you time them for when your baby is most awake and 

##### alert but calm. Experiment with different nursing positions to discover which works best for the two of you. Mothers 

##### of preterm babies often find the cross-cradle hold to be the easiest to use while "teaching" their baby how to latch on. 

##### Even if your baby doesn't suckle at the breast, you can express some milk onto your nipple, so your baby tastes your 

##### breast milk when them comes into contact with the areola and nipple.

##### A premature baby often tires rather easily, so these early feedings are likely to be brief. (You can use your remaining 

##### time together to hold, rock, sing to and cuddle your newborn.) Try to breastfeed as often as possible and continue to 

##### express milk for feedings in your absence. Frequent nursing and milk expression, as well as regular skin-to-skin 

##### holding, will help maintain your milk supply. 

### Rooming in with your preemie 

##### An increasing number of hospitals allow mothers to room in, or stay overnight with their babies, on the night or two 

##### prior to discharge from the NICU. This can help you start to learn your infants' round-the-clock hunger cues and 

##### breastfeeding rhythms. This experience can ease the transition from hospital to home life for you and your baby. 

### Skin-to-skin or "kangaroo" care 

##### Rooming in also enables skin-to-skin care (sometimes referred to as kangaroo care). 

##### This is shown to be beneficial for stability and optimal growth and development of premature babies. Breast milk 

##### pumping, or expression, immediately after holding your baby skin-to-skin is a very effective way to increase your milk 

##### supply. Some mothers find pumping at their baby's bedside in the NICU very helpful, as well. 

### Supplemental nutrition your baby may need in the NICU 

##### You will naturally want to focus on making the transition from feeding your expressed breast milk to direct 

##### breastfeeding, but understand that your hospital's medical staff wants to make sure your infant receives adequate 

##### calories and nutrition before they go home. To have adequate growth and strong bones with enough calcium being 

##### deposited in them, neonatologists may enrich the diet of tiny preterm babies by adding special supplemental 

##### nutrients to the mothers' breast milk, often in the form of commercially available milk fortifiers. Occasionally the 

##### doctors may decide to feed an infant with special baby formulas for premature infants, sometimes alternating the 

##### formula with your breast milk. 

##### Even if your baby is not getting feedings at all due to medical complications, continue to express your breast milk and 

##### freeze it for later use to help maintain your milk production. 

## Feeding your premature baby at home 

##### After your baby is home from the hospital, you may need to keep using your breast pump until your baby is 

##### exclusively breastfeeding (actually nursing) and growing well without the need for any supplemental bottles or 

##### formula. This lets you store breast milk for extra feedings and maintain an adequate milk supply, especially as your 

##### baby grows and their needs increase. 

##### Try to nurse whenever your baby shows an interest—even if it's every hour or hour and a half during the early weeks. 

##### If your premature baby is exclusively breastfed, your pediatrician should recommend a multivitamin and iron 

##### supplement. Finally, have your breastfeeding technique rechecked by your pediatrician or a lactation specialist 

##### shortly after your baby's homecoming. 

## Remember 

##### Caring for and learning to breastfeed a premature or ill newborn is emotionally taxing for any new mother. It's a good 

##### idea to contact support groups in your area that specialize in your baby's condition. Other mothers are often the most 

##### valuable sources of information. Make sure, too, that your partner and other family members understand the 

##### enormous advantages of breastfeeding a preterm baby or an ill hospitalized newborn. The emotional and practical 

##### support of your loved ones will go a long way in helping you achieve your breastfeeding goals.
