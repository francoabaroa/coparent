# Continuing Breastfeeding Beyond The First Year 

## If you are still breastfeeding your child through his first birthday, you can congratulate yourself 

## on having provided him with the best nutrition he could possibly receive. Now that he is 

## consuming a wide variety of solid foods, your breast milk has become somewhat less critical from 

## a nutritional perspective. Some toddlers continue to consume a moderate amount of breast milk 

## (and thus the nutrients it contains), while others “graze” and ingest smaller quantities, getting 

## most of their nutrition elsewhere. Certainly there is no known point at which breast milk 

## becomes nutritionally negligible. What we do know is that as your child moves from babyhood 

## toward toddlerhood, breastfeeding continues to act as a source of profound comfort and security, 

## laying the groundwork for a confident, happy, and healthy future. For this reason, as well as the 

## continued nutritional and immunologic benefits of breastfeeding, the AAP advises mothers to continue nursing 

## beyond the first year for as long as mutually desired by mother and child. 

## Starting the Journey Toward Self-Mangement 

## Many mothers appreciate the power and practicality of breastfeeding to soothe a toddler’s emotions, reassure him of 

## their presence, and provide comfort in an often confusing world. Other women worry that continuing breastfeeding 

## into toddlerhood prevents a child from learning to handle his emotions in alternative ways. The fact is, though, that 

## toddlers need emotional reassurance frequently during the day. It is as valid and acceptable for a toddler to breastfeed 

## for comfort as it is for him to suck a pacifier or thumb. 

## Dealing With Others' Opinions 

## Our culture can sometimes project a somewhat limited view of acceptable breastfeeding practices; while nursing 

## toddlers are becoming amore common sight, they still occasionally provoke comments and stares from uninformed 

## adults. When deciding how long to breastfeed your child, a more valid yardstick than public opinion is your own 

## child’s approach to nursing and your own feelings about it. These feelings are no doubt being communicated to your 

## child. Do you feel that he is dependent on the breast for comfort to the point that it interferes with his social growth 

## (just as a toddler whose relationship with his blanket is so intense that he’s unable to put it down to play with a friend)? 

## Are you concerned that his continued nursing is causing other adults (such as a child care provider, preschool 

## teacher, or other important person in his life) to label him in negative ways? Are your own mixed feelings about 

## breastfeeding a toddler interfering with your relationship with him, making you a reluctant and less supportive 

## partner? If your answers to all of these questions are no, then there is no reason to hasten the weaning process. 

## Mothers who have chosen to continue breastfeeding their toddlers have found many creative ways of dealing with the 

## surprise and uninformed disapproval they encounter among other adults. Many women teach their children a “code 

## word” to use when they want to breastfeed (such as “mimi” or “nonny”), so that the matter remains private between 

## the two of them. Some women then retire with their toddlers to a private place to breastfeed. On the other hand, others 

## make a point of breastfeeding in public, perhaps in the hopes of making it more acceptable for toddlers to continue 

## nursing. 

## Certainly even in this country the general attitude toward breastfeeding is gradually improving. Thanks to political 

## activism by parents’ groups and professional organizations, many states have enacted laws protecting a woman’s right 

## to breastfeed. In fact, as of 2010, forty-four states, plus the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands, had laws 

## allowing mothers to nurse in any public or private location. Only five states have no breastfeeding laws of any kind. 

## Most of these laws state that it is a woman’s right to breastfeed wherever she can legally be with her baby. Federal 

## legislation guarantees the right of breastfeeding mothers to nurse their babies anywhere on federal property where 

## the mother and baby have the right to be. This is a good thing not only for mothers, who so frequently have been 

## harassed simply for caring for their children, but also for children, who benefit from all the nutrition, comfort, and 

## love they receive. There is even federal legislation to protect the rights of working mothers to express their milk at the 

## workplace.

## We're Doing Fine, Thanks: Deciding What's Best For Your Child 

### In the end, the decision about how long to breastfeed your baby is one that only you—with help from your baby— 

### should make. The nursing relationship is a unique bond, one that ideally should be supported by your partner and 

### other family members. So whether it ends when your baby is six months old or three years old is a personal choice. 

### Follow your instincts, and do what is best for you and your baby.
