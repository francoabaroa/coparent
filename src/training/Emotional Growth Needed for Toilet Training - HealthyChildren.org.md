# Emotional Growth Needed for Toilet Training 

## For many parents, a child’s emotional readiness for toilet training is the most difficult to 

## recognize—particularly since a child moves in and out of emotional “prime times” and 

## troublesome periods for toilet training throughout early childhood. Emotional issues that can 

## profoundly affect toilet training include a desire for independence and self-mastery, the child’s 

## need to control some aspects of his environment, testing of limits and rules, his desire to win his 

## parents’ approval, fears associated with toilet use, and the desire to mimic or conform to other 

## children’s behavior. 

## The best way to determine the emotional state your child is in, and how conducive this is to toilet 

## training, is to observe both his general behavior and his responses to any suggestions about potty use. If he clearly 

## enjoys sitting on his potty or talking about potty use, his urge toward self-mastery will probably support his training. If 

## he resists the idea or cries when you mention the potty, he may be experiencing conflict and you will need to wait for a 

## more opportune time. 

## Self-Mastery 

## The desire to master one’s own body and environment is a powerful desire common to all toddlers and preschoolers. 

## The onset of cries of “I can do it!” will let you know that your oneor two-year-old’s urge toward independence is in 

## full swing. On one hand, this type of ambition can inspire great toilet-training progress as your child tries to act like a 

## big kid in every possible way. Periodically, however, his need to control his own body and environment may manifest 

## itself in less-than-desirable ways. Your one-year-old may insist on running away and hiding each time he feels the 

## urge to have a bowel movement—in an effort to prevent you from violating his fragile physical pride by picking him 

## up and placing him on the potty. He may even get up off the potty and have an accident on the living room floor for the 

## sheer satisfaction of making the decision where to urinate. At age two, he may yell “No!” whenever you ask him if he 

## needs to go, or delay going until it’s too late and an accident occurs. The more attention you give such experiments— 

## all normal attempts to test your rules and limits—the more he will repeat them. 

## The best response is to clean up the mess, keep your comments minimal, downplay the incident, and wait for a later, 

## more mature phase of independence to inspire him to show you what a “big boy” he can be. 

## Resistance 

## The desire to control his physical functions and his environment may increase during times of major change in the 

## child’s life. A child who feels disoriented by recent upsets (such as a move to a new home, a divorce, or the arrival of a 

## new baby in the house) may seek to regain emotional balance by exerting tighter control over those aspects of life that 

## are within reach. Inner stresses, such as fears resulting from a rapidly developing imagination, may also lead to 

## resistant behavior that makes toilet training difficult. Older toddlers and preschoolers, who are physiologically able to 

## delay bladder or bowel movements longer when desired, can deliberately withhold stool and become seriously 

## constipated in response to emotional stress, parental pressure, or even reluctance to let go of what they experience as 

## a part of their bodies. Again, when confronted with such resistance it’s best to talk with your child about what is 

## upsetting him, do your best to allay his fears, and then back off for a while. With your help, your child will soon pass 

## out of this emotional stage, and you can readdress toilet-training issues when he’s better prepared to do so. 

## Desire for Approval

### Two of the greatest tools parents can take advantage of during toilet training are their child’s desire for approval and 

### his urge to imitate others’ behavior. Your child’s experiments with winning your approval probably began before his 

### first birthday. Spurred by cognitive development to explore cause-and-effect relationships (“I bite Mommy’s nose and 

### what happens?”), he soon began to assemble a database of which types of actions win positive responses from you and 

### which do not. The more smiles and words of parental praise he experienced, the more he desired, and except during 

### the normal spurts of rebellion that occur throughout childhood, he will probably continue to make a great effort to 

### please you. Throughout the toddler and preschool years, praising your child for any small step toward bathroom 

### mastery will pave the way for faster, more positive training. 

### If your child has not been successfully toilet-trained by age three and a half, his renewed desire to please can make 

### adapting to potty use quite simple, for this is a time when many of his issues around independence will have been 

### resolved. In later chapters, we will discuss ways to tap into this desire to please through affirmation (“Look what a 

### great job you did!”), sticker charts, and other forms of positive reinforcement. 

## Social Awareness 

### Social awareness—the observation of and desire to be like others—gradually expands throughout the toddler and 

### preschool years, adding yet another motivator for your child to become fully toilet-trained. At around eighteen 

### months, your child is likely to become fascinated by the behavior of other children his age or a little older, and his 

### desire to imitate them may spur him to use the toilet much earlier than he otherwise would. (This is why children with 

### older siblings are often toilet-trained earlier than single children.) By age two and a half or three, he will become 

### interested in the concept of gender and focus on imitating the behavior of his same-sex parent. This is a good time for 

### parents to start inviting their same-sex child to observe them using the bathroom. If there is no adult of the same sex 

### in your household, try asking an adult relative or friend to act as role model. Not only will your child’s curiosity be 

### satisfied in this way, but he may decide to start trying to use the potty to “be more like” the grownup he admires. 

### By the preschool years, your child’s fascination with social identity and his peers’ behavior will provide quite strong 

### motivation to wear big-kid underwear and use the toilet like other children his age. If he has not already been toilet

### trained by this time, peer pressure alone can motivate him to train himself. In many cases, all it takes to toilettrain a 

### child at this age is to point out casually (never critically) that most of the other kids in his class seem to be out of 

### diapers. Once he is aware of this, your child may choose to toilet-train himself.
