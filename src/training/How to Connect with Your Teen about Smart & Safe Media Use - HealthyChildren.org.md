# How to Connect with Your Teen about Smart & Safe Media 

# Use 

## Teens have grown up surrounded by a steady flow of media. TV and 

## movies arrive by cable, satellite, streaming, and on demand. Social 

## media, fun apps, and video games are on tablets and 

## smartphones. Texting is as close as their thumbs. Teens may think 

## they know all about today's media, but they may not know enough 

## about viewing and interacting with media safely and wisely. 

## As a parent, it is your job to talk with your teen about smart and 

## safe media use. 

## Balancing the Digital World and Real 

## World 

## Both traditional and social media can enrich a teen's world with knowledge, create awareness of current events, and 

## promote civic and community involvement. Online video platforms such as FaceTime, Skype, and Google Hangout, 

## along with group text messaging and file sharing sites where several people can work on a document simultaneously, 

## allow students to collaborate on school projects and connect with friends and family far away. 

## If media use is not carefully managed, however, it can quickly get out-of-hand. According to a Common Sense Media 

## report (https://www.commonsensemedia.org/research/technology-addiction-concern-controversy-and-finding

## balance), 1 in 4 adolescents said they are "constantly connected" to the internet. All that time spent on their 

## smartphones and other devices can use up time needed to engage in activities essential for good health—like enough 

## sleep and exercise—and can negatively impact school performance. See Constantly Connected: Adverse Effects of 

## Media on Children & Teens (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/adverse-effects-of-television-commercials.aspx). 

## "Doze" and Don'ts 

## Teens need 8-10 hours of sleep a night, and devices and media use can disrupt both the length and the quality of sleep. 

## Discuss how to avoid "device damage" to good sleep hygiene with your teen: 

## When using screens in the evening, turn the brightness down, use a blue light filter, and turn them off 

## completely 1 hour before bedtime. The blue light from the TV or mobile screen can interfere with sleep. 

## Recharge devices overnight—outside the bedroom. Vibrating and audio alerts from incoming messages can 

## keep teens awake. Despite what your teen may tell you, putting a device on silent isn't enough. Your teen may be 

## tempted to use or check his or her device when he or she should be sleeping. The light given off by devices 

## charging at night can also affect sleep quality. 

## Avoid watching scary movies or playing violent games—especially in the evening. 

## The Obesity Connection 

## According to a 2016 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) technical report, "Children and Adolescents and Digital 

## Media (http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2016/10/19/peds.2016-2593)," several studies link more 

## screen time with obesity rates. To scale back this unhealthy effect, coach teens to: 

## Get at least one hour of exercise each day. See Physical Activities for Teens (/English/ages

## stages/teen/fitness/Pages/Physical-Activities-for-Teens.aspx). 

## Not watch TV or use mobile devices at meal time. See Food & Media: Not a Healthy Mix (/English/family

## life/Media/Pages/Food-and-TV-Not-a-Healthy-Mix.aspx). 


## Media and Multitasking 

#### Other times media use should be avoided: 

#### Driving. The National Safety Council estimates more than 1.5 million car accidents are caused by distracted 

#### drivers using cell phones each year. And—it's against the law. 

#### Walking. One survey (https://issuu.com/safekids/docs/skw_pedestrian_study_2014_final) found that 40% of 

#### teens have been hit or nearly hit by a car, bike, or motorcycle while walking—often while listening to music, 

#### texting, or talking on the phone. 

#### Doing homework. A 2015 research review 

#### (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273229714000513) suggests that multitasking with 

#### electronic devices has a negative effect on homework, studying, and grades. 

## Digitally Distorted Reality 

#### Help your teen understand that images or information on TV, in movies, or shared on social media do not always 

#### reflect real life. 

#### Body Image. Media often present unrealistically thin or muscular body images that can contribute to eating 

#### disorders or the use of potentially dangerous nutritional supplements. 

#### Risky Behavior. Media may make it seem like everybody is on board with certain risky activities. Consequences 

#### such as pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, and substance abuse rarely are shown. In reality, most (59%) 

#### of U.S. high school students surveyed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 

#### (https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/sexualbehaviors/) (CDC) have never had sex, for example, and 2016 National 

#### Institute on Drug Abuse data (https://www.drugabuse.gov/news-events/news-releases/2015/12/drug-use-trends

#### remain-stable-or-decline-among-teens) show the rate of teens reporting they had "been drunk" in the past year 

#### at historic lows. 

#### Violence. Many violent acts in the media are committed by characters otherwise shown as role models, but 

#### viewers rarely see the long-term physical and emotional suffering violence can cause. Presented as 

#### entertainment, virtual violence has been shown to increase real-life violence, aggressive thoughts and behavior, 

### and angry feelings (see How Virtual Violence Impacts Children's Behavior: Steps for Parents (/English/family

### life/Media/Pages/Virtual-Violence-Impacts-Childrens-Behavior.aspx) ). Despite these research findings, 

#### according to an AAP policy statement 

#### (http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2016/07/14/peds.2016-1298), most people assume they are 

#### immune to this effect. 

#### Stereotypes. Harmful stereotypes are less common than they once were in the media, but they still show up. 

#### Suggest teens compare images of diverse populations they see in the media with people they know in real life 

#### and consider how accurate or inaccurate those images are. Ask how he or she would feel as a victim of 

### discrimination or prejudice. See Talking to Children About Racial Bias (/English/healthy-living/emotional

### wellness/Building-Resilience/Pages/Talking-to-Children-About-Racial-Bias.aspx). 

## Digital Citizenship and Media Literacy 

#### Make sure teens are aware that people may not always be who they say they are online. Warn them that sex 

#### offenders often use social networking sites, e-mail, and online gaming to contact and exploit young people. 

#### Remind them that a platform's privacy settings do not make things actually "private;" images, thoughts, and 

#### behavior shared online becomes a part of their digital footprint indefinitely. Never forward a text or photo 

#### without asking permission. This includes texting of inappropriate pictures or "sexting." Images on apps like 

#### Snapchat, for example, may disappear after viewing but can easily be saved by using a phone's screen shot 

#### function. 

#### Have ongoing talks with your teen about responsible online citizenship. This includes treating others with 

#### respect online and offline and avoiding cyberbullying. Let them know to tell a parent, their pediatrician, or other 

#### trusted adult if they or others are being bullied, disrespected, attacked, or treated badly online.
