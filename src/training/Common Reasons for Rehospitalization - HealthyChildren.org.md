# Common Reasons for Rehospitalization 

## Technological advances in perinatal and neonatal medicine are creating a growing population of 

## infants with special medical needs, both in the hospital and at home. Babies are going home 

## sicker and quicker than ever before. Despite parental training in special care and close medical 

## follow-up, these infants are at significant risk for rehospitalization. A baby born weighing less 

## than 3 pounds, 5 ounces (1,500 grams) has almost a 40% chance of being rehospitalized during the 

## first year of life. 

## Depending on the underlying disease, statistics are similar for chronically ill or technology

## dependent infants. This rate drops to about 10% after the first year. 

## These statistics are not meant to frighten you. Rather, they are to remind you that your baby may still have special 

## health needs at discharge and that going home, in reality, is just the beginning of a whole new set of challenges for you 

## and your family. 

## “Tommy was rehospitalized three times during his first year at home. Each time was discouraging and exhausting for 

## the whole family. But now that he’s two years old, and he gets sick less often. I think we’ve turned the corner.” 

## Common childhood diseases can be potentially life-threatening for VLBW infants, those with BPD or other chronic 

## illnesses, and technology-dependent infants. Immunizing your NICU graduate is an important step in preventing 

## many potentially serious diseases. 

## Respiratory infections are the most frequent cause of hospital readmission among NICU graduates. They may result 

## in continued need for supplemental oxygen, ventilator support, respiratory treatments, and/or medications for 

## reactive airway disease (similar to asthma). The common cold, which is an upper respiratory infection, may cause 

## your baby significant respiratory distress. Infections of the lower respiratory tract, such as pneumonia, can have the 

## greatest impact on your baby, possibly requiring an extended hospital readmission. Respiratory infections occur more 

## frequently in babies who are exposed to smoking in the home than those who are not. 

## Feeding difficulties and unmet nutrition needs may also lead to repeated hospital admissions. Your baby may not be 

## meeting his nutritional requirements if he is nippling poorly, burning up too many calories working to breathe, or 

## experiencing gastroesophageal reflux disease. When conventional treatment methods for increasing nutritional 

## intake fail, your baby may be referred to an occupational or speech therapist who is specially trained in oral-motor 

## issues if oral feeding is the problem. If reflux is the problem and is severe, your baby may be readmitted for further 

## evaluation and/or for a surgical procedure called a fundoplication. Optimal nutrition and weight gain are necessary to 

## help your baby fight infections, decrease the work of breathing, lower oxygen requirements, and attain developmental 

## milestones. 

## If your NICU graduate is on an apnea monitor at home, you may at some point notice more frequent or intense 

## episodes of apnea and bradycardia. Report this trend to your pediatrician immediately. In some cases, a test to check 

## the theophylline or caffeine level in your baby’s blood may be done in your doctor’s office. If the episodes of apnea 

## and bradycardia are severe or are accompanied by other signs of illness, your baby may need to be readmitted to the 

## hospital for closer monitoring, further evaluation, and/or medication adjustments. 

## Neurodevelopmental problems, vision and hearing impairments, and cosmetic surgeries may also require hospital 

## readmission, especially when your child is older. A child with CP may require orthopedic surgeries to release tight 

## tendons. A child with a blocked tear duct may need a minor surgical procedure to open it up. If your baby has scars 

## from NICU procedures (chest tubes or major line placement), you may want to consider cosmetic surgery when he is 

## older and his medical risks have lessened or resolved. 

## Your Part in Preventing Rehospitalization 

## You can’t necessarily control the progress of your baby’s medical recovery, but you can take steps to reduce the risks 

## for rehospitalization. Here are some suggestions.

## Providing Adequate Care 

### Prevention of rehospitalization actually begins before discharge as you learn about your baby’s special care needs. 

### Ask questions and practice until you feel comfortable with and competent at providing your baby’s care. Speak up if 

### you have questions or feel that you are being hurried out the door. It’s normal to feel somewhat apprehensive when 

### your baby first comes home, but it helps to know that you are familiar with your baby’s care and understand how to 

### monitor for potential problems. 

## Working With Your Health Care Provider 

### Selecting a health care provider who understands the complex needs of a NICU graduate also helps prevent 

### rehospitalization. Weekly visits to the office may be necessary for the first month to monitor your baby’s weight gain 

### and general progress and to address your questions and concerns. Early identification of illness and good 

### communication with your health care provider can prevent a minor illness from turning into a major hospitalization.
