# Creating Positive Experiences for Your Infant 

## By:Robert Sege, MD, PhD, FAAP 

## The first year of life is filled with major growth and 

## development. (/English/ages

## stages/baby/Pages/default.aspx) It is easy to see how 

## the baby in your arms becomes the babbling baby 

## pulling up, giggling, laughing, and trying to walk and 

## talk! Infants also develop emotionally as they begin to 

## learn about the world of people. 

## Fortunately, parents naturally provide the love that 

## infants and toddlers need. Among the many changes at 

## birth, mothers and their partners experience a surge in 

## a hormone called oxytocin. This hormone is known commonly as the "love hormone." It provides a rush of emotion to 

## fuel the bond between children and their parents. 

## Everyday ways to be positive 

## Positive experiences during these years helps set patterns and build a strong foundational relationship that will last a 

## lifetime. Here are a few things to remember as you and your baby are creating those first experiences. 

## Comfort your baby. All babies cry. This is how babies communicate before they can say words. Often, it's easy to 

## figure out what makes babies cry. First, check to see if they are hungry, their diaper is wet, or something else is 

## bothering them. Sometimes, they really need comforting. Try swaddling (/English/ages-stages/baby/diapers

## clothing/Pages/swaddling-is-it-safe.aspx) your baby. This reminds them of the comfortable feeling of being inside the 

## womb. Many parents find that walking with their baby or humming, singing, or rocking gently, can help. 

## Every so often, your baby will still cry no matter what you try. If you're feeling frustrated, it's okay to put your baby 

## back into the crib and let them cry it out. Remember, deep in your heart, that crying is just what babies do at this age, 

## and that this phase will pass soon enough! 

## Start a "conversation." Of course, babies do not understand words yet. Right now, they are learning the sounds and 

## rhythm of language—from you. As they babble and coo, and their parents speak with them, they learn about the back 

## and forth of conversation. 

## Talking with your baby begins the long process of language development. It also teaches them about feelings. 

## Sometimes those feelings are love. Sometimes they are frustration, humor, or boredom. Hearing you talk, the sounds 

## and rhythms of speech, the expressions on your face, and the way you hold them all teach babies about emotional 

## expression. 

## Sometime around two months old, your baby will begin to reward you with smiles and giggles and then babbling. All 

## these wonderful natural changes are the first steps of learning language. They also let you know that your baby is off 

## to a great start. 

## Cuddle & hold your baby. Babies feel secure and loved when held by their parents, grandparents, and caregivers. This 

## physical affection helps babies control their own emotions. Close physical connection between babies and parents is 

## so important that pediatricians recommend skin-to-skin contact (/English/ages-stages/baby/preemie/Pages/About

## Skin-to-Skin-Care.aspx) right after birth to help the newborn adjust to life. Having a parent hold the baby close so 

## important that it is part of the care given to premature infants in the hospital. This expression of love rewards the baby. 

## It also brings joy to parents. 

## Trust yourself. Relationships between parents and infants are the most important and satisfying connections we ever 

## have. They keep parents and children stable and resilient through the ups and downs of life.
