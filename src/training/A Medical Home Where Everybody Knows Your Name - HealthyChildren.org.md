# A Medical Home Where Everybody Knows Your Name 

## What Is a Medical Home? 

## This idea of a “medical home” — a place where everybody knows your name and your medical 

## records are complete — is nothing new. In fact, that term has been used in medical and 

## government circles for well over a decade. 

## A medical home combines place, process, and people. It is not a building, house, or hospital, but 

## rather an approach to providing comprehensive primary care. A medical home represents an 

## approach to pediatric health care in which a trusted physician partners with the family to 

## establish regular ongoing care. Through this partnership, the primary health care professional (/English/tips

## tools/find-pediatrician/Pages/Pediatrician-Referral-Service.aspx) can help the family and patient access and 

## coordinate specialty care, other health care services, educational services, in and out of home care, family support, and 

## other public and private community services that are important to the overall health of the child and family. Providing 

## a medical home means addressing the medical and non-medical needs of the child and family. 

## A pediatric medical home is defined by the AAP as having the following characteristics: 

## The medical care of infants, children, adolescents, and young adults ideally should be accessible, continuous, 

## comprehensive, family-centered, coordinated, compassionate, and culturally effective. 

## It should be delivered or directed by well-trained physicians who provide primary care and help to manage and 

## facilitate essentially all aspects of pediatric care. 

## The physician should be known to the child and family, and be able to develop a partnership of mutual 

## responsibility and trust. 

## Children can be cared for at a physician’s office, a hospital outpatient clinic, a community health center, or a 

## schoolbased clinic, as long as it provides the services that constitute comprehensive care. Those services include: 

## Partnership: Provision of family-centered care through developing a trusting partnership with families, 

## respecting their diversity and recognizing that they are the constant in a child’s life. 

## Clarity: Sharing clear and unbiased information with the family about the child’s medical care and management 

## and about the specialty and community services and organizations they can access. 

## Primary care: Provision of primary care, including but not restricted to acute and chronic care and preventive 

## services, including breastfeeding promotion and management, immunizations, growth and developmental 

## assessments, appropriate screenings, health care supervision and patient and parent counseling about health, 

## nutrition, safety, parenting, and psychological issues. 

## Secondary care: Assurance that ambulatory and inpatient care for acute illnesses will be continuously available 

## (24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year). 

## Continuity: Provision of care over an extended period of time to ensure continuity. Transitions, including those 

## to other pediatric providers or into the adult health care system, should be planned and organized with the child 

## and family. 

## Referrals: Identification of the need for consultation and appropriate referral to pediatric medical subspecialists 

## and surgical specialists. (In instances in which the child enters the medical system through a specialty clinic, 

## identification of the need for primary pediatric consultation and referral is appropriate.) Primary, pediatric 

## medical subspecialty, and surgical specialty care providers should collaborate to establish shared management 

## plans in partnership with the child and family and to formulate a clear articulation of each other’s role. 

## Intervention: Interaction with early intervention programs, schools, early childhood education and childcare 

## programs, and other public and private community agencies to be certain that the special needs of the child and 

## family are addressed. 

## Coordination: Provision of care coordination services in which the family, the physician, and other service 

## providers work to implement a specific care plan as an organized team. 

## Record-keeping: Maintenance of an accessible, comprehensive, central record that contains all pertinent 

## information about the child, preserving confidentiality.

### Assessment: Provision of developmentally appropriate and culturally competent health assessments and 

### counseling to ensure successful transition to adult-oriented health care, work, and independence in a deliberate, 

### coordinated way. 

### To meet the definition of medical home, a designated physician must ensure that the aforementioned services are 

### provided, regardless of the venue in which the medical care is provided. 

## Is It OK to Leave Home? 

### Obviously, the ER does not meet those objectives, nor is it designed to do so. As its name implies, the ER is for 

### emergencies only — when your child experiences a life-threatening illness or injury and can’t wait for a trip to the 

### doctor’s office. 

### But what about walk-in health care centers, including the new breed of in-store clinics offered by major drugstore 

### chains? Is it ever acceptable to go to a walk-in for relatively minor health complaints like earaches and sore throats? 

### Certainly, these clinics can be helpful, especially if you are away from home or an illness occurs after hours. But just 

### like the ER, they don’t meet the definition of a medical home, and for the health of your child, you should think twice 

### about using them routinely. 

### The need for an ongoing source of health care — ideally a medical home — for all children has been identified as a 

### priority for child health policy reform at the national and local level. Over the next decade, with the collaboration of 

### families, insurers, employers, government, medical educators, and other components of the health care system, the 

### quality of life can be improved for all children through the care provided in a medical home.
