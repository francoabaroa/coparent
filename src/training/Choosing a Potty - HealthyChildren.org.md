# Choosing a Potty 

## Once your child demonstrates an interest in or readiness for toilet training, it’s time to install a 

## potty in your home. Take your child with you to purchase his “special chair,” explain to him what 

## it will be used for, and let him help decide which one to buy. 

## Once you’ve brought the potty home, write your child’s name on it. Encourage him to play with it, 

## set it where he wants it, and surround it with his favorite stuffed animals, books, and toys. Pride of 

## ownership frequently facilitates a toddler’s or preschooler’s interest in potty use, and its child

## friendly size enables him to satisfy the powerful desire to “do it himself.” 

## On the other hand, children who are more focused on behaving like an older sibling may prefer using a stepstool to 

## climb onto an adult toilet with a child’s seat attached. 

## It isn’t necessary to first put the potty in the bathroom. While some parents have found that placing the chair in the 

## bathroom helps their child associate it more quickly with the act of elimination, others have met with greater success 

## by keeping the potty in their child’s bedroom, where it is easily accessible after a nap, or in the kitchen for use after 

## meals. Later, when the child has begun to use the potty with some regularity, the potty can be moved to the bathroom 

## or even replaced with a child’s seat on an adult toilet.
