# Baby Birthmarks & Rashes 

## By: Nick Nguyen, MD, FAAP & Sheilagh M. Maguiness, MD, FAAD, FAAP 

## Gazing at your new baby, taking in every little detail, is one of the 

## many joys of parenthood. Among many unique features you might 

## notice is a birthmark, a different-looking spot on the skin that a 

## baby is born with or develops soon after birth. 

## There are two main types of birthmarks: pigmented, spots of skin 

## that contain extra pigment (color); and vascular, which contain 

## extra blood vessels that didn't fully form. Both types are usually 

## harmless, and some go away on their own. But some need to be 

## watched to make sure they don't cause problems. Be sure to talk 

## with your pediatrician about any birthmarks or rashes you 

## notice on your baby. 

## Vascular Birthmarks—Pink, Red & Blue 

## Pink, red, and blue birthmarks often are made up of extra blood vessels. The extra blood can make some vascular 

## birthmarks feel warm to touch. Vascular birthmarks may look and behave differently depending on the type of blood 

## vessels in them. The most common blood vessel birthmarks include: 

## Nevus Simplex: "salmon patch," "angel kiss" & "stork bite" birthmarks 

## Nevus simplex are flat pink or red birthmarks that up to 80% of babies are born with. They are 

## collections of small, red blood vessels called capillaries. Often, these marks are located on the 

## eyelids, forehead, back of neck, top of head, under the nose, and lower back. Sometimes, they are 

## called "salmon patch" marks, "stork bites" (when located on back of the neck) and "angel kisses" 

## (when they're between the eyebrows). 

## Nevus simplex birthmarks usually will go away on their own by the time your baby is a toddler. Do 

## not be alarmed if the birthmark gets darker when your baby becomes more emotional or active— 

## this is normal. 

## Most nevus simples are totally harmless and do not need treatment. But be sure to talk with your pediatrician if they 

## are large or located in unexpected areas. 

## Port Wine Stains 

## Port wine stains are fairly common, seen in about 3 in 1,000 children. They 

## are similar to nevus simplex: flat, pink or red birthmarks made up of extra 

## capillaries. They also are visible at birth. But these birthmarks are usually 

## larger than nevus simplex and may affect more areas of the face and body. 

## Unlike some other birthmarks, port wine stains do not go away. They grow as 

## your child grows, but slowly. Over time, they may become darker and thicker. 

## Port wine stains aren't usually linked to any health problems. If the 

## birthmark affects a certain part of the face, like the eyelid and forehead, 

## though, it may be related to a condition called Sturge-Weber syndrome. This condition is rare, but your doctor may 

## recommend more evaluation or testing if your baby is at risk. 

## Some children and teens are not bothered by their port-wine stain, while others may feel self-conscious about them. 

## Laser treatment may be able to lighten the birthmark some and help prevent darkening and thickening. But it will not 

## "erase" the birthmark in most cases. 


### Infantile Hemangiomas 

###### These benign growths, which usually appear in the first few weeks of life, are 

###### made of extra blood vessels in the skin. Infantile hemangiomas 

###### (/English/ages-stages/baby/bathing-skin-care/Pages/Infantile

###### Hemangiomas-Baby-Birthmarks.aspx)are fairly common--found in up to 5% 

###### of infants. They usually grow rapidly, and then gradually shrink and fade. If 

###### they form near the top of the skin, they are red (and sometimes called 

##### "strawberry marks"). Deeper in the skin, they may look blue or purple, like 

###### bruises. 

###### Infantile hemangiomas grow most quickly in the first 5-7 weeks of life, so it is important to talk to your pediatrician 

###### about them early. Some hemangiomas may be associated with certain health problems and require additional testing 

###### and/or treatment. Safe treatments are available today for problem hemangiomas. But these treatments usually work 

###### best when started shortly after these birthmarks form--generally by around 1 month age. Talk with your pediatrician if 

###### you think your baby may have an infantile hemangioma. 

### Congenital Hemangiomas 

###### Congenital hemangiomas are present at birth. Sometimes, they can be seen during prenatal 

###### ultrasound exams. They are different from infantile hemangiomas and much rarer. This type of 

###### hemangioma does not grow after the baby is born. Congenital hemangioma often look like a 

###### large round or oval bump or mass. They tend to be purple to blue, but may also have tiny red 

###### blood vessels on the surface and a white ring around the base. 

###### Some of these birthmarks begin to disappear quickly (a type called rapidly involuting congenital 

###### hemangioma). Another type, non-involuting congenital hemangioma, does not go away at all. In 

###### most cases, congenital hemangiomas are not dangerous and do not need treatment. If the 

###### birthmark does not go away, it can be removed with surgery or other treatments when a child is older. 

### Venous Malformation 

###### Venous malformations are tangles of veins in the skin that did not form 

###### properly during development. The veins give these birthmarks a blue or 

###### purple color. They are present at birth but may not become obvious until the 

###### teenage years. The veins can become larger with activity or certain positions, 

###### and they may become painful. Venous malformations are rare, affecting 

###### around 2 in 10,000 children. 

###### These birthmarks may cause no problems at all. But treatment may be 

###### needed if the birthmark is painful or affects your child's activities. 

###### Sometimes, small clots called phleboliths form in the veins. In most cases, these clots are not harmful but can be hard 

###### and cause pain. Compression garments, medications, surgery or procedures may be among treatment options. 

###### Most venous malformations are located only in the skin, but sometimes they can also be found in muscles, bones, or 

###### organs. Your doctor may recommend a scan to get more information about your child's birthmark. 

#### Blood Vessel Birthmarks 

###### What does it look like? Does it need to be treated? 

###### Nevus Simplex 

###### Flat, pink or red birthmarks present at 

###### birth. 

###### Sometimes called "salmon patch" 

###### marks. 

###### Based on location, also called "stork 

###### bite" (on back of neck) and "angel kiss" 

###### (between the eyes). 

###### Most do not need treatment and go away 

###### on their own by the toddler years. 

###### Talk with your pediatrician if the 

###### birthmark is large or in an unusual area.

###### Port-Wine Stain 

###### Flat, pink or red birthmarks that may 

###### look like maroon liquid splashed on 

###### skin. 

###### Like, but usually larger than, nevus 

###### simplex. 

###### May affect more areas on the face and 

###### body. 

###### Usually no related health problems. 

###### If they are on certain parts of head and 

###### face, tests may be needed for rare 

###### related health condition. 

###### May become darker and thicker over 

###### time; laser treatment may help lighten 

###### them some. 

###### Infantile 

###### Hemangioma Bumpy red or flat bluish marks usually 

###### appearing in first few weeks of life. 

###### Near the top of the skin, they're red 

###### ("strawberry marks"). 

###### Deeper in the skin, they look blue or 

###### purple, like bruises. 

###### Usually don't cause problems, but some 

###### need treatment to avoid permanent 

###### changes or health problems. 

###### After a period of fast growth, usually 

###### start to shrink and fade at about age 1. 

###### Congenital 

###### Hemangioma Usually large round or oval bumps that 

###### are fully formed at birth. 

###### Purple or blue in color, some with tiny 

###### red blood vessels on surface & white 

###### ring around base. 

###### Usually require no treatment. 

###### One type (rapidly involuting) starts to 

###### disappear quickly. 

###### Others (non-involuting) don't go away. 

###### Can be removed later with surgery and 

###### other treatments. 

###### Venous 

###### Malformation Blue or purplish tangles of veins in the 

###### skin that did not form properly during 

###### development. 

###### Present at birth but may not become 

###### obvious until teen years. 

###### Treatment may not be need unless the 

###### birthmark becomes painful or affects 

###### your child's activities. 

###### Sometimes, small clots form in the veins. 

###### In most cases, the clots are not harmful. 

## Pigmented Baby Birthmarks—Brown & Grey 

###### Brown and grey birthmarks may be made of extra melanocytes—the cells that produce pigment (color) in the skin. 

###### Pigmented birthmarks can look and behave differently from each other. Some are harmless, but others can come with 

###### health problems for your baby. 

### Congenital Melanocytic Nevi (Moles) 

###### Congenital melanocytic nevi are commonly called moles. They can be 

###### present at birth or appear during the first year of life. These birthmarks are 

###### common, found in 1-3% of newborns. Congenital nevi can look very different 

###### from each other. Most are brown, but they may also have shades of pink, red, 

###### or black. Sometimes they have bumps or hair, and they may become rough 

###### or raised. Most congenital melanocytic nevi are harmless and usually do not 

###### require treatment or removal. Many dermatologists and pediatric 

###### dermatologist simply monitor them at well-child visits. They can also tell 

###### you what changes 

###### (https://pedsderm.net/site/assets/files/1028/3_spd_moles-melanoma_web_final.pdf) you should watch for in your 

###### child's birthmark. 

###### A nevi usually grows larger as your child grows, but not quickly. They are classified based on their size: small, medium 

###### and large/giant nevi. Large and giant nevi may have a higher risk for a type of skin cancer, melanoma 

###### (https://pedsderm.net/site/assets/files/1028/3_spd_moles-melanoma_web_final.pdf), compared to small congenital 

###### nevi or other moles that appear later in life. It's important for all children, but especially those with this type of 

###### birthmark, to wear sun protection (/English/safety-prevention/at-play/Pages/Sun-Safety-and-Protection-Tips.aspx) 

###### outdoors. 

###### A child with more than one congenital melanocytic nevus always needs to be evaluated by his or her pediatrician or 

###### pediatric dermatologist. Having more than one congenital nevus at birth may be related to problems with the brain 

###### and spinal cord. Your doctor may recommend a scan of these areas in this case, but this is extremely rare. Learn more

###### Society for Pediatric Dermatology. 

### Café-au-lait 

###### Café-au-lait means "coffee with milk," which describes the light brown color of these common 

###### birthmarks. As many as 20-30% of people have one. The marks are flat and usually round or oval 

###### shaped. Most are smaller than a child's palm and have smooth borders. They are visible at birth or 

###### develop very early in life. 

###### Most café-au-lait spots are harmless. They are unlikely to turn into skin cancer, but may become 

###### darker with more sun exposure. A large café au lait spot with jagged borders may be linked with a 

##### rare genetic condition called McCune-Albright syndrome. Multiple café-au-lait spots can be a 

##### sign of other conditions, including one called neurofibromatosis. If your child has a large café-au

###### lait spot, more than 5 spots, or spots in the armpits/groin, talk with your pediatrician about them. 

### Dermal Melanocytosis 

###### These are the most common birthmarks in babies with highly pigmented skin. They are seen in 

###### 85% of Asians, 96% of blacks & 46% of Hispanic babies at birth. They are usually located on the 

###### lower back and bottom, but some babies may have spots on different areas of the body. These 

###### birthmarks may be a mix of colors including brown, gray, blue and black. Their unique color 

###### comes from having pigment in different layers of the skin. 

##### Most dermal melanocytosis birthmarks, which used to be called Mongolian spots, gradually fade. 

###### Many disappear by the toddler years. The majority of them are harmless and do not need 

###### treatment. In rare cases, these birthmarks may be associated with genetic conditions. If your 

###### baby has other health problems and several spots, please talk with your pediatrician. 

### Pigmentary Mosaicism 

###### Mosaicism is a word that means two sets of DNA, or genes, are present in the same person. In 

###### pigmentary mosaicism, different genes might affect the color of the skin. These changes can be 

###### subtle or very large. Pigmentary mosaicism birthmarks have unique patterns including lines and 

###### swirls. With sun exposure, areas can become lighter or darker. 

###### Even though the genetic change involved with pigmentary mosaicism is present at birth, the 

###### affected skin may not turn color until later in life. Sometimes sun exposure can cause this to 

###### happen. These changes can give the illusion that the birthmark is "spreading." In most children, 

###### pigmentary mosaicism is harmless. A small number of may have problems with the bones, eyes 

###### or brain especially if their birthmark covers a large area of their body, so your pediatrician may recommend some 

###### tests. 

#### Pigmented Baby Birthmarks 

###### What does it look like? Does it need to be treated? 

###### Congenital 

###### Melanocytic Nevi Various sized moles present at 

###### birth or appearing during first 

###### year of life. 

###### Most are brown but may also 

###### have shades of pink, red, or 

###### black. 

###### Some may have a lot of hair. 

###### Can become rough, bumpy 

###### and raised. 

###### Most are harmless, but it is important to watch for 

###### changes in the birthmark. 

###### Sun protection is important to avoid unhealthy 

###### changes. 

###### Larger nevi present at birth, and multiple moles that 

###### appear, should be checked for related health 

###### conditions.

###### Café-au-lait 

###### Café-au-lait ("coffee with 

###### milk") describes the light 

###### brown color of these spots. 

###### Flat and usually round or oval 

###### shaped. 

###### Most are smaller than a child's 

###### palm. 

###### Present at birth or early in life. 

###### Most are harmless and need no treatment. 

###### A large one with jagged borders--or multiple café

###### au-lait spots (more than 5 spots, or spots in the 

###### armpits or groin) --should be checked for a possible 

###### rare genetic condition. 

###### Dermal 

###### Melanocytosis May be a mix of colors 

###### including brown, gray, blue, 

###### and black. 

###### Unique color comes from 

###### having pigment in different 

###### layers of skin. 

###### Usually located on the lower 

###### back and bottom. 

###### Most are harmless and go away on their own by 

###### toddler years. 

###### In rare cases, may be associated with rare genetic 

###### conditions. 

###### Pigmentary 

###### Mosaicism Have unique patterns, 

###### including lines and swirls. 

###### Affected skin, which contains 

###### different genes at birth, may 

###### not turn color until later in 

###### life. 

###### With sun exposure, areas can 

###### become lighter or darker. 

###### Usually harmless. 

###### In rare cases, especially if the birthmark covers a 

###### large area of the body, may signal related problems 

###### with the bones, eyes or brain. 

## Remember: 

###### Most birthmarks are harmless and are part of what makes your child unique. But some types of birthmarks can come 

###### with potential health problems or may cause some children to feel self-conscious. That's why it is important to talk 

###### with your pediatrician about any unusual marks or changes on your child's skin. There are safe and effective 

###### treatment options available today that are especially effective when started early.
