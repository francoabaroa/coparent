# Colic Relief Tips for Parents 

## Does your infant have a regular fussy period each day 

## when it seems you can do nothing to comfort them? 

## This is common for babies. It tends to happen between 

## 6:00 p.m. and midnight—just when you, too, are feeling 

## tired from the day. These periods of crankiness may 

## feel like torture, especially if you have other demanding 

## children or work to do. Fortunately, though, they don't 

## last long. 

## When are babies the most 

## fussy? 

## The length of this regular fussing (/English/ages-stages/baby/crying-colic/Pages/Responding-to-Your-Babys

## Cries.aspx) usually peaks at about three hours a day by six weeks, and then declines to one or two hours a day by three 

## to four months. As long as your baby calms (/English/ages-stages/baby/crying-colic/Pages/Calming-A-Fussy

## Baby.aspx) within a few hours and is relatively peaceful the rest of the day, there's no reason for alarm. 

## Symptoms of colic in babies 

## If the crying does not stop, but intensifies and lasts throughout the day or night, it may be caused by colic. About 

## one-fifth of all babies develop colic, usually between the second and fourth weeks. Colicky babies cry inconsolably, 

## often screaming, extending or pulling up their legs, and passing gas (/English/ages-stages/baby/diapers

## clothing/Pages/Breaking-Up-Gas.aspx). The crying spells can occur around the clock, although they often become 

## worse in the early evening. 

## What causes a colic? 

## Unfortunately, there is no definite explanation for why this happens. Most often, colic means simply that the child is 

## unusually sensitive to stimulation. They may not be able to "self-console" or regulate their nervous system (also 

## known as an immature nervous system.) 

## Sometimes, in breastfeeding babies, colic is a sign of sensitivity to a food in the mother's diet (/English/ages

## stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Infant-Allergies-and-Food-Sensitivities.aspx). The discomfort is caused only rarely 

## by sensitivity to milk protein in formula. Colicky behavior also may signal a medical problem, such as a hernia 

## (/English/health-issues/conditions/abdominal/Pages/Inguinal-Hernia.aspx) or some type of illness. 

## How long does colic last? 

## As they mature, this inability to self-console—marked by constant crying—will improve. Generally, "colicky crying" 

## stops by three to four months, but it can last until six months of age. 

## How to relieve colic symptoms 

## Although you simply may have to wait it out, several things might be worth trying. First, of course, consult your 

## pediatrician to make sure that the crying is not related to any serious medical condition that may require treatment. 

## Then ask the doctor which of the following would be most helpful. 

## If you're nursing , you can try to eliminate milk products, caffeine, onions, cabbage and any other potentially 

## irritating foods from your own diet. This is good to discuss with your pediatrician first. Try eliminating only one 

## thing at a time, and expect it to take about two weeks before you may see any changes. 

## If you're feeding formula to your baby , talk with your pediatrician about a protein hydrolysate formula. Less 

## than 5% of colicky crying is caused by food sensitivity, but in rare cases a change may help within a few days. 


#### Do not overfeed your baby , which could make them uncomfortable. In general, try to wait at least two to two

#### and-a-half hours from the start of one feeding to the start of the next. 

#### Walk your baby in a baby carrier (/English/safety-prevention/on-the-go/Pages/Baby-Carriers.aspx) to soothe 

#### them. The motion and body contact will reassure them, even if their discomfort persists. 

#### Rock your baby , run the vacuum in the next room, or place them where they can hear the clothes dryer, a fan or 

#### a white-noise machine. Steady rhythmic motion and a calming sound may help them fall asleep. However, never 

#### place your child on top of the washer/dryer. 

#### Introduce a pacifier (/English/ages-stages/baby/crying-colic/Pages/Pacifiers-Satisfying-Your-Babys

#### Needs.aspx). While some breastfed babies will actively refuse it, it will provide instant relief for others. 

#### Lay your baby tummy-down (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/The-Importance-of-Tummy-Time.aspx) 

#### across your knees and gently rub their back. The pressure against their belly may help comfort them. If they 

#### fall asleep this way, place them in their crib on their back. 

#### Swaddle (/English/ages-stages/baby/diapers-clothing/Pages/swaddling-is-it-safe.aspx) them in a large, thin 

#### blanket so that they feel secure and warm. 

#### When you're feeling tense and anxious, have a family member or a friend look after the baby—and get out of the 

#### house. Even an hour or two away will help you maintain a positive attitude. If no other adult is available to help, it's OK 

#### to lay the baby on their back in the crib or another safe place and leave the room for a few minutes. 

## Remember 

#### No matter how impatient or angry you become, a baby should never be shaken (/English/safety-prevention/at

#### home/Pages/Abusive-Head-Trauma-Shaken-Baby-Syndrome.aspx). Shaking an infant hard can cause blindness, brain 

#### damage, or even death. Let your own doctor know if you are depressed or are having trouble dealing with your 

#### emotions. They can recommend ways to help.
