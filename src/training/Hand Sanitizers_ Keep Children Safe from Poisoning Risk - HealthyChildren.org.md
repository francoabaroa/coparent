# Hand Sanitizers: Keep Children Safe from Poisoning Risk 

## By: Kevin Osterhoudt, MD, MSCE, FAAP, FAACT, FACMT 

## Washing hands (/English/health

## issues/conditions/prevention/Pages/Hand-Washing-A

## Powerful-Antidote-to-Illness.aspx) with soap and clean 

## water for at least 20 seconds is the best way for children 

## to get rid of germs, including the virus that causes 

## COVID-19 (/English/health-issues/conditions/chest

## lungs/Pages/2019-Novel-Coronavirus.aspx). If soap and 

## water are not available, you can use hand sanitizer with 

## at least 60% alcohol. However, use it with care around 

## children, since swallowing hand sanitizer can cause 

## poisoning. 

## Remember to keep hand sanitizers out of children's reach. Don't forget about travel-size bottles of sanitizer in 

## purses, diaper bags, backpacks and cars. Supervise children ages 5 and younger when they use hand sanitizer. And 

## when using hand sanitizer dispensers, it is important to position them in a way that won't squirt into your child's eyes. 

## Types of alcohol in hand sanitizers 

## Many hand sanitizers are made with alcohol or rubbing alcohol (ethanol, ethyl alcohol, or isopropanol, isopropyl 

## alcohol). Alcohol poisoning symptoms include loss of balance, sleepiness, low blood sugar, seizures and coma, and it 

## can be fatal. 

## Children and adults also have been poisoned after using hand sanitizer that contained methanol (also called wood 

## alcohol, methyl alcohol, or methylated spirits). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued recalls 

## (https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/your-hand-sanitizer-fdas-list-products-you-should-not-use)for 

## products containing methanol, which is toxic if swallowed or after repeated use on skin. It can cause problems ranging 

## from nausea and headaches to blindness, nervous system damage or death. An FDA import alert 

## (https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-takes-action-place-all

## alcohol-based-hand-sanitizers-mexico-import) also warns about products found to contain methanol and/or 1

## propanol, another form of alcohol that should not be used in hand sanitizers. 

## Hand sanitizer poisonings during the COVID-19 pandemic 

## Since families began buying more hand sanitizer during the COVID-19 pandemic, the National Poison Data System has 

## been getting many more reports of unintentional exposures in children. Many are for children ages 5 years and 

## younger. 

## Health experts recommend using hand sanitizer that is 60% to 95% alcohol to kill the virus that causes COVID-19. 

## Drinking alcohol typically has 5% to 40% alcohol. 

## Check the label 

## Before buying or using hand sanitizer, make sure it has a label that lists the ingredients, warnings and precautions. In 

## addition, it's a good idea to check the do-not-use list at http://www.fda.gov/handsanitizerlist 

## (https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-updates-hand-sanitizers-consumers-should-not-use). 

## To reduce the risk of injury from children drinking hand sanitizers, producers should add ingredients to make them 

## taste bitter. This important step helps prevent children from eating the product. 

## At the start of the pandemic, the FDA began letting distilleries and other companies that do not normally produce 

## hand sanitizer make and sell it to help meet demand. At the same time, the FDA received alerts that some young 

## people have tried drinking hand sanitizers from distilleries that have not taken the step to make them taste bad. It has 

## since ended this temporary policy and now expects careful production standards.

### You can check for bitter ingredients such as denatonium benzoate (Bitrex); sucrose octaacetate; or butanol (also 

### called tert-butyl alcohol). Current denatured hand sanitizers are made to taste bitter, but you should dispose of any old 

### bottles of "denatured alcohol," which may have toxic methanol added. 

### Be especially careful with hand sanitizers made with isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol) around children. These can be 

### more toxic than those made with ethanol or ethyl alcohol. 

## Is homemade hand sanitizer a good idea? 

### Make-your-own hand sanitizer recipes, widely available on the internet, may not be the best option for families. The 

### FDA warns that if made incorrectly, hand sanitizer may not work. There have also been reports of skin burns from 

### homemade hand sanitizer. 

## How to dispose of recalled hand sanitizers 

### Do not flush or pour recalled hand sanitizers down the drain. These products should be disposed of in hazardous waste 

### containers, if possible. If unsure, check with your local waste management and recycling center. 

## When to call 911 

### Call 911 (/English/health-issues/injuries-emergencies/Pages/Calling-911-How-and-When-to-Call-for-Help.aspx) right 

### away if your child has collapsed, is having a seizure, is having a hard time breathing, or if they can't wake up after 

### using or swallowing hand sanitizer products. Otherwise, you can reach your regional poison control center by calling 

### 1-800-222-1222. 

## Talk with your pediatrician 

### If you have questions about hand sanitizers, talk with your pediatrician. Your regional Pediatric Environmental Health 

### Specialty Unit (PEHSU (https://www.pehsu.net/)) have staff who can also talk with parents about concerns over 

### environmental toxins.
