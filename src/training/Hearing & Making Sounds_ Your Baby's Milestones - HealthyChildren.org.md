# Hearing & Making Sounds: Your Baby's Milestones 

## Between about one and three months of age, your baby 

## will reach some fun hearing and speech milestones. 

## These include smiling at the sounds of your voices and 

## turning their head toward the direction of sound. 

## They'll also begin to babble and imitate some sounds. 

## The sound of your voice 

## Just as your baby (/English/ages

## stages/baby/Pages/default.aspx) naturally prefers the 

## human face over other visual patterns, they also prefer 

## the human voice to other sounds. They will recognize 

## and respond to those voices they hear most. They 

## associate them with warmth, food, and comfort. Babies like high-pitched voices in general—a fact that most adults 

## seem to understand intuitively and respond to accordingly, without even realizing it. 

## Listen to yourself the next time you talk to your baby. You'll probably notice that you raise your pitch, slow your 

## speech, exaggerate syllables, and widen your eyes and mouth more than normal. This dramatic approach is 

## guaranteed to capture almost any baby's attention—and usually make her smile. 

## By listening to you and others, your baby will discover the importance of speech long before they understand or 

## repeats specific words. By one month, they'll be able to identify you by voice, even if you're in another room. 

## First conversations 

## As you talk to your baby, they'll be reassured, comforted, and entertained. When they smile and gurgle at you, they'll 

## see the delight on your face and realize talk goes both ways. These first conversations teach her many of the subtle 

## rules of communication, such as turn-taking, vocal tone, imitation, pacing, and speed of verbal interaction. 

## At about two months, your infant may begin cooing and repeating some vowel sounds (ah-ah-ah, ooh-ooh-ooh). Over 

## the first four to six months, imitate their cooing, while adding simple words and phrases to your “conversations." It's 

## easy to fall into a habit of baby talk, but you should try mixing your conversations with adult language and eventually 

## phase out the baby talk. During early infancy, you should also read (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/The-Secret-to-a

## Smarter-Baby.aspx) to your baby, even if you think they doesn't comprehend. 

## By four months, your infant will babble routinely, often amusing themselves for long periods by producing strange 

## new sounds ( muh-muh, bah-bah). They'll also be more sensitive to your tone of voice and the emphasis you put on 

## words or phrases. 

## As you move through each day together, they'll learn from your voice when you're going to feed them, change their 

## diapers (/English/ages-stages/baby/diapers-clothing/pages/Changing-Diapers.aspx), go for a walk, or put them down 

## to sleep. The way you talk shows them much about your mood and personality (/English/ages

## stages/baby/pages/Babys-Temperament.aspx), and the way they respond shows you a lot about theirs. If you speak in 

## an upbeat or comforting way, they may smile or coo. Yell or talk angrily, and they'll probably startle or cry.
