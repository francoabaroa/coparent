# Safety for Your Child: 1 to 2 Years 

## Did you know that injuries are the leading cause of death of 

## children younger than 4 years old in the United States? 

## The good news is that most of these injuries can be prevented. 

## Often, injuries happen because parents are not aware of what their 

## children can do. At this age your child can walk, run, climb, jump, 

## and explore everything. Because of all the new things they can do, 

## this stage is a very dangerous time in your child's life. 

## Because your child cannot understand danger or remember "no" 

## while exploring, it's your responsibility to protect them from injury. 

## Firearm hazards 

## Children in homes where guns (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/Handguns-in-the-Home.aspx) are present 

## are in more danger of being shot by themselves, their friends, or family members than of being injured by an intruder. 

## It is best to keep all guns out of the home. Handguns are especially dangerous. If you choose to keep a gun, keep it 

## unloaded and in a locked place, with the ammunition locked separately. Ask if the homes where your child visits or is 

## cared for have guns and how they are stored. 

## Poisonings 

## Children continue to explore their world by putting everything in their mouths, even if it doesn't taste good. Your child 

## can open doors and drawers, take things apart, and open bottles easily now, so you must use safety caps on all 

## medicines and toxic household products. Keep the safety caps on at all times or find safer substitutes to use. Contact 

## Poison Help for more information. 

## Your child is now able to get into and on top of everything. Be sure to keep all household products and medicines 

## completely out of sight and reach. Never store lye drain cleaners in your home. Keep all products in their original 

## containers. Use medicines exactly as directed and dispose of unused medicine safely as soon as you are finished with 

## it. 

## Falls 

## To prevent serious falls, lock the doors to any dangerous areas. Use gates on stairways and install operable window 

## guards above the first floor. Remove sharp-edged furniture from the room your child plays and sleeps in. At this age 

## your child will walk well and start to climb, jump, and run as well. A chair left next to a kitchen counter, table, or 

## window allows your child to climb to dangerously high places. Remember, your child does not understand what is 

## dangerous. 

## If your child has a serious fall or does not act normally after a fall, call your doctor. 

## If your child does put something poisonous into his or her mouth, call Poison Help immediately at 1-800-222-1222. 

## Do not make your child vomit. 


## Burns 

#### The kitchen is a dangerous place for your child during meal preparation. Hot liquids, grease, and hot foods spilled on 

#### your child will cause serious burns. A safer place for your child while you are cooking, eating, or unable to give them 

#### your full attention is the playpen, crib, or stationary activity center, or buckled into a high chair. It's best to keep your 

#### child out of the kitchen while cooking. 

#### Children who are learning to walk will grab anything to steady themselves, including hot oven doors, wall heaters or 

#### outdoor grills. Keep your child out of rooms where there are hot objects that may be touched or put a barrier around 

#### them. If you have a gas fireplace (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/Fireplace-Safety_Tips.aspx), keep 

#### children away from it while it is in use and for at least an hour after turning it off. The glass doors get extremely hot 

#### and can cause severe burns. 

#### Your child will reach for your hot food or cup of coffee, so don't leave it within your child's reach. NEVER carry your 

#### child and hot liquids at the same time. You can't handle both. 

#### To protect your child from tap water scalds, the hottest temperature at the faucet should be no more than 120°F. In 

#### many cases you can adjust your water heater. 

#### Make sure you have a working smoke alarm on every level of your home, especially in furnace and sleeping areas. 

#### Test the alarms every month. It is best to use smoke alarms that use long-life batteries, but if you do not, change the 

#### batteries at least once a year. 

## Drowning 

#### At this age your child loves to play in water. NEVER leave your child alone in or near a bathtub, pail of water, wading or 

#### swimming pool, or any other water, even for a moment. Empty all buckets after each use. Keep the bathroom doors 

#### closed. Your child can drown (/English/safety-prevention/at-play/Pages/Water-Safety-And-Young-Children.aspx) in 

#### less than 2 inches of water. Knowing how to swim does NOT mean your child is safe near or in water. Stay within an 

#### arm's length of your child around water. 

#### If you have a swimming pool, fence it on all 4 sides with a fence at least 4 feet high, and be sure the gates are self

#### latching. Most children drown when they wander out of the house and fall into a pool that is not fenced off from the 

#### house. You cannot watch your child every minute while he or she is in the house. It only takes a moment for your 

#### child to get out of your house and fall into your pool. 

## And remember car safety 

#### Car crashes are a great danger to your child's life and health. The crushing forces to your child's brain and body in a 

#### crash or sudden stop, even at low speeds, can cause severe injuries or death. To prevent these injuries use a car safety 

#### seat (/English/safety-prevention/on-the-go/Pages/Car-Safety-Seats-Information-for-Families.aspx) EVERY TIME your 

#### child rides in the car. All infants and toddlers should ride in a rear-facing car safety seat until they reach the highest 

#### weight or height allowed by their car safety seat's manufacturer. Be sure that the safety seat is installed and used 

#### correctly. Read and follow the instructions that come with the car safety seat and the instructions for using car safety 

#### seats in the owners' manual of your car. 

#### The safest place for all infants and children to ride is in the back seat. 

#### Do not leave your child alone in or around the car. Keep vehicles and their trunks locked. Children who are left in a car 

#### can die of heat stroke because temperatures can reach deadly levels in minutes. They can be strangled by power 

#### windows or knock the vehicle into gear. Always walk behind your car to be sure your child is not there before you 

#### back out of your driveway. You may not see your child behind your car in the rearview mirror. 

### Remember, the biggest threat to your child's life and health is an injury.

#### If your child does get burned, immediately put cold water on the burned area. Keep the burned area in cold water 

#### for a few minutes to cool it off. Then cover the burn loosely with a dry bandage or clean cloth. Call your doctor for 

#### all burns.
