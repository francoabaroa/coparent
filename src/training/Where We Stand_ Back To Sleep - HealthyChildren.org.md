# Where We Stand: Back To Sleep 

## Based on an evaluation of current sudden infant death 

## syndrome (SIDS) (/English/ages

## stages/baby/sleep/Pages/Preventing-SIDS.aspx) data, 

## the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that 

## healthy infants always be placed for sleep on their 

## backs (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/Sleep

## Position-Why-Back-is-Best.aspx)—whether for nap 

## time or nighttime. 

## Despite common beliefs, there is no evidence that 

## choking is more frequent among infants lying on their 

## backs (the supine position) when compared to other 

## positions, nor is there evidence that sleeping on the 

## back is harmful to healthy babies. Babies with gastroesophageal reflux (/English/health

## issues/conditions/abdominal/Pages/GERD-Reflux.aspx) (excessive spitting up) should still be placed on their backs. In 

## some very rare circumstances (for instance, if your baby has just had back surgery), your infant may need to be on the 

## stomach for sleep. Discuss your individual circumstances with your pediatrician. 

## Since 1992, when the American Academy of Pediatrics began recommending this sleep position, the annual SIDS rate 

## has declined more than 50 percent. However, there has also been an increase in accidental suffocation deaths. A safe 

## sleep environment (baby on his back in a crib close to the parents' bed without any bedding or soft objects) is 

## important to protect your baby from SIDS or an accidental suffocation death.
