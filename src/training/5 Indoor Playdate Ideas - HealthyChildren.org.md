# 5 Indoor Playdate Ideas 

## Playdates provide your little ones opportunities to build social skills and use their imaginations. A playdate can also be 

## a great time for you to connect with other adults and get some social time for yourself. 

## Playdates at a park, for example, are always a great way to let kids connect and have fun. But outside is not always an 

## option, and coming up with creative ways to keep your kids entertained indoors can be a challenge. 

## What are some good activities for an indoor playdate? 

## Here are five indoor playdate ideas that let you set up engaging scenarios of unstructured play. You can let your kids 

## be kids. And, while staying within earshot, you can get a much-needed break to socialize with your parent friends. 

## Helpful tip: For each suggestion, gather the items beforehand and put them in one place such as a large box, bin or 

## laundry basket. Providing everything in advance streamlines the process and makes clean up easier. 

## A classroom of our own 

## Set the scene: Set up one area as a little classroom. Provide engaging learning tools such as books, blocks, 

## art supplies and fun puzzles. You can also give the kids pads of paper, pencils and stickers so they can 

## create their own worksheets. Add a few dolls and stuffed animals as other classroom friends. 


### Kids can take on the role of teacher or student. They can review letters and numbers, gather around for 

### story time, discover days of the week with a calendar and even practice their scissor skills during arts and 

### crafts time. 

### Parent prompts: What will you be learning about today? Who are some of the other "kids" in your class? 

### I'd love to see one of your art projects. 

## Our sweet bakery 

### Set the scene : Gather pretend play food, cookie sheets, baking pans, cookie cutters and baking toys. Add 

### some paper, crayons and stickers so kids can create a menu of items. They can highlight the day's sweet 

### specialties and decorate small cardboard boxes as take-out containers. Kids can take turns in different 

### roles— dressing up as the baker, and buying goodies as the customer. Check in on their progress by 

### visiting their store and trying some of their "yummy" treats. 

### Parent prompts: What's the name of your bakery? Does it have a theme? What's your most popular 

### item? Is there a sign out front? 

## The zookeeper zone 

#### Back to Top 


### Set the scene : Stuffed animals, dolls, animal puzzle pieces and animal figures can be the zoo residents. All 

### kinds of wooden blocks can be used to create animal enclosures of different sizes and shapes. Who could 

### be making all those sounds? The animals must be hungry! A zookeeper has important jobs to do. Time to 

### feed the animals, fix things around the zoo and take some of the animals out for a stroll. 

### Parent prompts: What's your favorite animal? How big is your zoo? Can you put any of the animals in 

### the same area? What do you feed the animals? 

## Put on a show 

#### Back to Top 


### Set the scene : Provide a variety of items that kids can use as props in their stage show. Sheets, towels and 

### blankets make great impromptu costumes. Homemade tiaras or hats can be the crowning touch in a 

### fashion show. Kids can add music to their performance as they shine in the spotlight while dancing or 

### walking the red carpet. Set up a few chairs draped with a sheet or blanket to designate the "back stage" 

### area as budding stars get ready with makeup and hair. When they're ready, they can offer you a ticket to 

### the show with a front row seat. (Be sure to give a standing ovation for a job well done!) 

### Parent prompts: What's the name of your show? Can you describe your fashion statement for the 

### audience? May I have your autograph? 

## Go on a train trip 

#### Back to Top 


### Set the scene : Kids can take a pretend train trip and visit different people and places throughout their 

### journey. You can create no-mess train tracks by placing blue painter's tape or masking tape along the 

### floor. They can build towns they'll pass using blocks. Then it's "all aboard" as the conductor stamps the 

### tickets and rolls the train cars along the tracks. You never know which friends (stuffed animals or dolls) 

### may be waiting at the next station. 

### Parent prompts: Where is the train taking you? Who will you visit? How long is your train? Can you 

### work together to build the tallest tower you'll see along the way?
