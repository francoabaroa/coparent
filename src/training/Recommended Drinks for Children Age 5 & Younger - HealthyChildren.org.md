# Recommended Drinks for Children Age 5 & Younger 

## By: Natalie D. Muth, MD, MPH, RDN, FAAP 

## What you offer your child to drink in the first 5 years of 

## life can shape taste preferences for a lifetime. But from 

## plant-based and toddler milks to 100% juice, stevia

## sweetened fruit drinks and flavored milk, the options 

## and the marketing can be overwhelming. 

## Thankfully, the best-choice 

## beverages are really simple: 

## water and plain milk. 

## Plain water (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Choose-Water-for-Healthy-Hydration.aspx) provides the 

## hydration all of us need to live. Milk provides calcium, vitamin D, protein, vitamin A, and zinc―all essential for healthy 

## growth and development. 

## Suggested Daily Water & Milk Intake 

## for Infants & Young Children 

## 6-12 months 12-24 months 2-5 years 

**Water** (^) 4-8 oz/day 

## 0.5-1 cup/day 

## 8-32 oz/day 

## 1-4 cups/day 

## 8-40oz/day 

## 1-5 cups/day 

## Cow's Milk* None 16-24 oz/day 

## 2-3 cups/day 

## 16-20oz/day 

## 2-2.5 cups/day 

## *Children ages 12-24 months are advised to drink whole milk and children 2 and older nonfat (skim) or low-fat (1%) milk. For information 

## about short-term use of cow's milk for children over 6 months of age during the current baby formula shortage (/English/tips-tools/ask-the

## pediatrician/Pages/are-there-shortages-of-infant-formula-due-to-COVID-19.aspx), read this article (/English/tips-tools/ask-the

## pediatrician/Pages/are-there-shortages-of-infant-formula-due-to-COVID-19.aspx). 

## How do young children develop unhealthy beverage preferences? 

## We know children who drink mostly water and plain milk from a young age tend to continue drinking them as they 

## age. But we also know, bad habits form early. Young children who are introduced to sweet drinks at a young age 

## develop a strong preference for them―making water and plain milk a harder sell. PS: The same goes for food 

## preferences (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/How-Children-Develop-Unhealthy-Food-Preferences.aspx). 

## When can I give my baby water? How much is ok? 

## Around 6 months, you can start offering your baby a little bit of water (4-8 oz/day, 0.5-1 cup/day) in an open, sippy, or 

## strawed cup. This helps develop cup drinking skills and familiarity with water. If you live in an area where the water is 

## fluoridated (/English/healthy-living/oral-health/Pages/Water-Fluoridation.aspx), drinking water will also help 

## prevent future tooth decay. Note that the actual water intake is unlikely to replace much breast milk or formula at this 

## point. Remember, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends breastfeeding as the sole source of 

## nutrition for your baby for about 6 months. When you add solid foods (/English/ages

##### stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Working-Together-Breastfeeding-and-Solid-Foods.aspx) to your baby's diet, 

#### continue breastfeeding until at least 12 months. Also see How to Safely Prepare Formula with Water (/English/ages

#### stages/baby/formula-feeding/Pages/how-to-safely-prepare-formula-with-water.aspx). 

##### At 12 months, you can transition your baby from breastmilk or formula to whole or reduced-fat milk. You can 

##### continue to breastfeed your baby after 12 months for a year or more, as long as you and your baby want to. For 

##### formula-fed babies 12 months and under, see Why Formula Instead of Cow's Milk? (/English/ages

##### stages/baby/formula-feeding/Pages/Why-Formula-Instead-of-Cows-Milk.aspx). 

## What about all of the other types of drinks? 

##### While drinking only water and plain milk is the ideal, we know young children may be exposed to any number of 

##### other drinks at some point. 

### Here's why most of these other drinks should be avoided, 

##### 100% juice: it's very sweet tasting and lacks fiber, an important nutrient found in whole fruit. Once children are 

##### exposed to juice, it may be difficult to limit portions or get them to prefer plain water. In some cases where whole 

##### fruit is not available, giving your child a small amount of 100% juice (no more than 4 ounces per day in 2-3 year

##### olds and no more than 4 to 6 ounces in 4-5 year-olds) can provide some nutritional benefit. However, infants less 

##### than 1 year of age should not drink juice. Eating fruit is always preferred to drinking juice. 

##### Flavored milk. Chocolate, strawberry, and other flavored milks contain added sugars (/English/healthy

##### living/nutrition/Pages/How-to-Reduce-Added-Sugar-in-Your-Childs-Diet.aspx). Added sugars should be avoided 

##### in children less than 2 years of age. Children aged 2-5 also should avoid flavored milk to minimize added sugars 

##### intake and avoid developing a preference for sweet tastes. An early preference for flavored milk may make it 

##### more difficult to get them to accept regular milk. 

##### Plant-based 'milk.' For some children, a dairy allergy or milk intolerance (/English/healthy

##### living/nutrition/Pages/Lactose-Intolerance-in-Children.aspx) may make it difficult to drink cow's milk. But keep 

##### in mind, most plant-based milks are not nutritionally-equivalent to cow's milk and may be lacking in important 

##### nutrients such as protein (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Beyond-Chicken-Nuggets.aspx), vitamin D, 

##### and calcium. Other than soy milk (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Milk-Allergy-Foods-and-Ingredients

##### to-Avoid.aspx), plant-based milks are not recommended for children to drink in place of dairy milk. Soy milk is 

##### nutritionally equivalent to cow's milk and is an acceptable alternative. 

##### Steviaor artificially-sweetened drinks. The health risks of stevia or artificial sweeteners to children are not 

##### well understood. For this reason, it is best to avoid sweetened drinks, even if they are calorie-free. When children 

##### have a strong preference for sweet drinks, it can lead them to dislike or refuse plain water. 

##### Toddler milk. Toddler milks, often marketed by formula companies as "transitional" to wean from breast milk or 

##### formula, are unnecessary and potentially harmful to young children. These products contain added sugars and 

##### may fill a baby's stomach up so he or she is not hungry for healthier foods. 

##### Sugary drinks. Sugary drinks (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/How-to-Reduce-Added-Sugar-in-Your

##### Childs-Diet.aspx) like sodas, sports drinks, fruit drinks, lemonade, sweetened water, and other drinks containing 

##### added sugars are harmful to a child's health. They increase the risk of excess weight gain, dental cavities 

##### (/English/healthy-living/oral-health/Pages/Healthy-Teeth-and-Your-Childs-Diet.aspx), heart disease 

##### (/English/health-issues/conditions/heart/Pages/Heart-Disease.aspx), diabetes (/English/health

##### issues/conditions/chronic/Pages/Diabetes.aspx), and fatty liver disease. 

##### Caffeinated drinks. Caffeine (/English/ages-stages/teen/nutrition/Pages/Hidden-Caffeine.aspx) in young 

##### children increases the risk of poor sleep, irritability, nervousness, headaches, and difficulty concentrating. All 

##### caffeine-containing beverages are best avoided. 

###### Editor's note: These early beverage recommendations are drawn from a report published by Healthy Eating Research, a national program of 

###### the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics along with the American Heart Association, the 

###### Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, and the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry.
