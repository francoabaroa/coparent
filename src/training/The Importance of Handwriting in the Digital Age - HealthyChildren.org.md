# The Importance of Handwriting in the Digital Age 

## By: Yolanda (Linda) Reid Chassiakos, MD, FAAP 

## Improving children's penmanship, legibility, pencil grasp, and 

## working on problem areas are all important things that need to be 

## addressed—especially in the digital age when most of our written 

## communication is done through texting on mobile devices or typing 

## on a keyboard. Voice recognition software has even evolved to the 

## point that commands can now be verbal—making even keystrokes 

## obsolete! 

## So, are handwriting skills critical to your child's success? What's 

## lost as tech-savvy young children learn to tap, swipe and touch 

## screens before they have even learned to pick up a pencil or tie 

## their shoelaces? 

## While the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) does not currently have a policy on handwriting, here's what we do 

## know based on the published research available: 

## Visual-motor skills, such as eye-hand coordination, are associated with academic achievement. Scientists have 

## found that developing fine motor skills in early childhood can predict not only writing success, but better 

## performance in reading and math in elementary school. One study 

## (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22026324) even showed how the Handwriting Without TearsGet Set for 

## School® (HWT-GSS) program improved fine motor and "pre-writing" skills of Head Start students. 

## Children who can write quickly and legibly are more likely to demonstrate skills in expressing their thoughts 

## through the written word. When kids struggle to write neatly and efficiently, they are often accused of being lazy, 

## and this may affect their behavior and self-esteem. 

## A study (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16390289) that followed children in grades two through five, 

## demonstrated that printing, cursive writing, and typing on a keyboard are all associated with distinct and 

## separate brain patterns—and each result in a distinct end product. For example, when these children were asked 

## to come up with ideas for a composition, the ones with better handwriting showed greater neural activation in 

## areas associated with working memory—and increased overall activation in the reading and writing networks. 

## A Pew Research survey (http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2013/Teachers-technology-and-writing/Summary

## of-Findings.aspx) of teachers around the country found that today's digital technologies make middle and high 

## school students more likely to use informal language in formal papers and plagiarize. In high school years, kids 

## who struggle with handwriting may also suffer even more as they struggle to keep up with the volume of written 

## work required. 

## A 2012 review (http://www.intechopen.com/books/dyslexia-a-comprehensive-and-international-approach/the

## contribution-of-handwriting-and-spelling-remediation-to-overcoming-dyslexia) suggests that cursive may be 

## particularly effective for individuals with developmental dysgraphia (/English/health

## issues/conditions/learning-disabilities/Pages/Types-of-Learning-Problems.aspx) (motor-control difficulties in 

## forming letters) and that it may aid in preventing the reversal and inversion of letters. 

## What Parents and Teachers Can Do: 

## The first attempts at writing can be challenging for young children—whose necessary fine motor skills are not yet 

## fully developed. But, some skills critical for school-readiness are simple to build at home and in preschool. The 

## handwriting practice young children get as they learn and grow can help improve their fine motor abilities and visual

## motor performance. 


#### Allow for scribble time. Provide lots of opportunities to trace and draw shapes and simple drawings in early 

#### childhood BEFORE letters are introduced. Even making the simplest marks requires that a child's brain, nerve 

#### cells, and muscles work together to produce the building blocks of legible writing: recognition of shapes and 

#### letters, moving in a sequence and direction on a page, and copying shapes such as vertical and horizontal lines, 

#### circles and crosses. 

#### Color in the lines. Throw in some special projects that require slow, controlled movements. For example, 

#### squeeze glitter glue over a line, fill in shapes with paint or use small, circular strokes to color an image. 

#### Tracing tactics. Let your child trace over your shapes in sand, or with chalk on a board before trying to draw the 

#### shapes on their own. Older kids can benefit from grid drawings to strengthen their visual motor skills. 

#### Work that core! Exercise the core muscles and shoulder muscles so that the hands and fingers will be able to 

#### move more freely and accurately. Climbing on playgrounds, for example, gives these muscles a good workout. 

#### Good posture is important when working on writing. 

#### Hand-eye coordination. Help your child develop this skill with lots of gross motor hand-eye exercises. For 

#### example, play bean bag games, ball tossing games, and bat and ball games as much as possible. You can also look 

#### for worksheets and activity books that have mazes and follow-the-path pictures. 

#### Monitor media use time. Educators continue to encourage a balance between media use time and the 3-D 

#### world. Encourage your child to spend less time on electronic devices and more time on gross motor and fine 

#### motor activities to build these skills. Computer games do not help develop the in-hand manipulation and finger 

### skills that are needed for handwriting. See Why to Limit Your Child's Media Use (/English/family

### life/Media/Pages/The-Benefits-of-Limiting-TV.aspx) for more information. 

## The Cursive Debate: 

### Cursive writing lessons used to be standard curricula in elementary schools across the US. Now many schools have 

#### cut cursive teaching to 15 minutes or replaced it with other priorities in the curricula. The Common Core standards 

#### call for teaching legible writing, but only in kindergarten and first grade. After that, the emphasis quickly shifts to 

#### proficiency on the keyboard. 

#### Today, not only are many students unable to read or write in cursive, many teachers are not adequately trained in its 

#### instruction. 

## What We Know that Works: 

#### Let's face it—technology is bound to continue developing and more research is needed to identify the best ways to 

#### teach handwriting to young children. But, there is certainly plenty of evidence that talking to your young children, 

#### reading to them, playing with them, and co-viewing and co-using digital media with them (in moderation) provides a 

#### jump start in developing the thinking, moving, talking, writing, and reading skills needed for a healthy and successful 

#### journey in school.
