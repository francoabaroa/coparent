# Treatments & Tests Your Preemie May Not Need in the 

# Hospital 

## Premature babies often need tests or treatments in the hospital. Some tests and treatments have side effects and 

## risks. So it's important to get just the ones your baby needs. 

## Here are some common tests and treatments your baby may not need. 

## Heartburn medicine for premature babies. 

## Premature babies may stop breathing for 15 to 20 seconds at a time during sleep. These breathing pauses tend to go 

## away as the baby develops. 

## In some cases, doctors give these babies heartburn medicine. They do this because many babies have reflux ("spit up"). 

## Doctors used to think that reflux made the breathing problem worse. But there's little evidence that heartburn 

## medicine helps. In fact, the medicine may be harmful to newborns. 

## Antibiotics for babies without infections. 

## When newborns are at risk for infection, doctors may give them antibiotics right away, before they know if the baby 

## has an infection. Doctors do this because blood test results can take 2 days, and it is better to be safe. 

## The problem is that some babies get antibiotics for too long, even though blood tests are negative and the baby has 

## remained well. In this case, antibiotics won't help your baby. Also, long-term use of antibiotics in premature babies can 

## cause serious problems, even death. 

## So, ask your doctor if your baby really needs to continue on the antibiotics. 

## Pneumograms before babies come home. 

## Most premature babies stop having breathing pauses by the time they reach full-term development. If they don't, 

## some doctors may order a pneumogram. This is a test that records a baby's breathing, heart rate, and oxygen level 

## during sleep. In some cases, this test may be helpful. 

## But the test does not help prevent dangerous breathing problems in premature newborns. And the test can lead to 

## more tests and unnecessary worry for parents. 

## Daily X-rays for premature babies. 

## Some premature babies need breathing tubes, and some need catheters. Catheters are tubes put into a vein to give 

## medicine, nutrition, and fluids. 

## From time to time, the hospital takes an X-ray to make sure that the tube hasn't moved. But babies should not get 

## these X-rays every day. 

## There is no evidence that a daily X-ray helps prevent any problems. 

## Daily X-rays give unnecessary radiation. This may increase the risk of cancer, especially in babies. 

## Brain MRIs before babies come home. 

## Premature babies are at risk for problems with brain development. Some doctors check for these problems before 

## sending the baby home. Some may do this using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a test that takes detailed pictures 

## of the brain. But: 

## An MRI can't really tell you how your child's brain will develop over time, especially if the test is abnormal.

#### Brain development problems can be identified during routine tests at the pediatrician's office.
