# Food Allergy Reactions 

## How do I know if my child has a food allergy? 

## A food allergy happens when the body reacts against harmless proteins found in foods. The 

## reaction usually happens shortly after a food is eaten. Food allergy reactions can vary from mild 

## to severe. Because there are many things that can be confused with food allergies, it is important 

## for parents to know the difference. 

## Symptoms of A Food Allergy 

## Skin problems 

## Hives (red spots that look like mosquito bites) 

## Itchy skin rashes (eczema, also called atopic dermatitis) 

## Swelling 

## Breathing problems 

## Sneezing 

## Wheezing 

## Throat tightness 

## Stomach symptoms 

## Nausea 

## Vomiting 

## Diarrhea 

## Circulation symptoms 

## Pale skin 

## Light-headedness 

## Loss of consciousness 

## If several areas of the body are affected, the reaction may be severe or even life-threatening. This type of allergic 

## reaction is called anaphylaxis and requires immediate medical attention. 

## Not A Food Allergy 

## Food can cause many illnesses that are sometimes confused with food allergies. The following are not food allergies: 

## Food poisoning —Can cause diarrhea or vomiting, but is usually caused by bacteria in spoiled food or 

## undercooked food. 

## Drug effects —Certain ingredients, such as caffeine in soda or candy, can make your child shaky or restless. 

## Skin irritation —Can often be caused by acids found in such foods as orange juice or tomato products. 

## Diarrhea —Can occur in small children from too much sugar, such as from fruit juices. 

## Some food-related illnesses are called intolerance, or a food sensitivity, rather than an allergy because the immune 

## system is not causing the problem. Lactose intolerance is an example of a food intolerance that is often confused with 

## a food allergy. Lactose intolerance is when a person has trouble digesting milk sugar, called lactose, leading to 

## stomachaches, bloating, and loose stools. 

## Sometimes reactions to the chemicals added to foods, such as dyes or preservatives, are mistaken for a food allergy. 

## However, while some people may be sensitive to certain food additives, it is rare to be allergic to them. 

## Foods That Can Cause Food Allergies 

## Any food could cause a food allergy, but most food allergies are caused by the following: 

## Cow milk 

## Eggs

## Peanuts 

## Soy 

## Wheat 

## Nuts from trees (such as walnuts, pistachios, pecans, cashews) 

## Fish (such as tuna, salmon, cod) 

## Shellfish (such as shrimp, lobster) 

## Peanuts, nuts, and seafood are the most common causes of severe reactions. Allergies also occur to other foods 

## such as meats, fruits, vegetables, grains, and seeds such as sesame. 

## The good news is that food allergies are often outgrown during early childhood. It is estimated that 80% to 90% of egg, 

## milk, wheat, and soy allergies go away by age 5 years. Some allergies are more persistent. For example, 1 in 5 young 

## children will outgrow a peanut allergy and fewer will outgrow allergies to nuts or seafood. Your pediatrician or 

## allergist can perform tests to track your child's food allergies and watch to see if they are going away.
