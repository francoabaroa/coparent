# Using Your Past 

## I did not have a great childhood. How do I make sure my children 

## have a better experience than I did? 

## When most parents set their standards and expectations for parenting, they take into account their recollections of 

## their own youth. As a first step toward understanding your own approach to parenting, and to use that information in a 

## positive way, examine it through the prism of your own childhood. 

## To begin, answer the following questions: 

## 1. What do you remember about the family you grew up in, particularly your relationships with your mother and 

## father? What do you appreciate most about their way of raising you? 

## 2. What did you most enjoy doing with each of your parents? The answer to this question might give you a clue to 

## the activities your own child might enjoy doing with you. 

## 3. What were the greatest difficulties you had with your parents? This information might help you avoid problem 

## areas with your own youngster, while understanding why you respond to certain parental situations the way you 

## do. For instance, if you felt your parents were too strict, you might become too permissive with your own child; or 

## if you believe your mother and father were too withdrawn and quiet, you might insist upon talking with your 

## child a lot. 

## 4. What do you feel were their greatest shortcomings as parents? If your own father became abusive when he got 

## angry, for example, you might feel anxious whenever tempers flare in your own household, and you might try to 

## avoid angry confrontations. 

## Your Family Experience 

## You can also learn a lot from childhood relationships with your brothers and sisters. Ask yourself questions like: 

## What were the best aspects of your relationship with your siblings? What did you enjoy doing most with them? What 

## problems and conflicts did you have with them? How do you feel your parents handled these conflicts? 

## If you were an only child, you might have difficulty adjusting to the way your own youngsters relate to one another; 

## you may find their fighting quite disturbing, although if you had grown up with siblings, you would understand better 

## that sibling bickering is quite normal. Or if you were the oldest (or the youngest) child in your family, you might 

## unconsciously identify more with your own oldest (or youngest) child. 

## Using Your Childhood Memories 

## Think about the significant events that took place in your childhood. What do you remember about moves to a new 

## city? Starting school? Illnesses or injuries? Losses (the death of a pet, a friend moving away, a stolen bicycle)? These 

## childhood memories can affect how you relate to your own youngsters today. If you had a tough time moving to a new 

## neighborhood when you were young, you might find it hard to put your own child through the same experience. If the 

## first day at a new school was always difficult for you, you might feel especially anxious when your child changes 

## schools. 

## Also, examine your own memories of teachers and classmates, your academic performance, what you liked and 

## disliked about school and important school events (tests, oral reports, class trips, science fairs). Think back upon your 

## childhood friendships, too: best friends, adversaries, activities with other children and how you adjusted to changes in 

## friendships. 

## As you reflect upon these childhood experiences, you might recognize how they have influenced your responses to 

## your own child's interactions with others and not always in a positive way. For instance, your youngster may prefer 

## coming home after school, playing a musical instrument, doing homework and not spending much time in social

### activities. However, if you yearned to be more popular when you were young, you might push your son to participate 

### more in sports, 4-H, or Scouting activities, although he might have no interest in them. These are issues you need to 

### become more sensitive to. 

## Talk About Your Past 

### As part of this self-examination, talk with your youngster about your own childhood recollections. He will love to hear 

### stories about what life was like for you when you were his age. It will give him a sense of history and belonging. It will 

### also help him through difficult times once he finds out that you, too, might not have been invited to a party you really 

### wanted to go to, or that, like him, you had fears about giving an oral report in front of the class.
