# Breastmilk and Your Diet 

## What affects the content of my breastmilk? 

## Pregnant women usually pay close attention to their diet, since every food, beverage, and drug 

## they ingest may make its way to their baby. Fortunately, this is not exactly the case with 

## breastmilk. 

## Breastmilk is produced from the mammary glands in your breasts, not directly from the 

## substances you ingest. These glands draw on the resources available in the form of nutrients 

## from your diet and from your body’s stores of nutrients. If your diet contains insufficient calories 

## or nutrients to fully sustain both you and your nursing child, your mammary glands will have “first shot” at your 

## body’s available nutrients to produce highly nutritious breastmilk, leaving you to rely on whatever is left over. So a 

## less-than-ideal diet will probably not affect your breastfeeding child, but it may leave your body at nutritional risk. (If 

## you have any concerns that you may not be getting the proper amount of nutrients, talk to your doctor or nutritionist 

## about improving your diet or the possibility of taking supplements.) 

## The mammary glands and cells that produce milk also help regulate how much of what you eat and drink actually 

## reaches your baby. Moderate consumption of coffee, tea, caffeinated sodas, and an occasional glass of wine or other 

## alcoholic beverage are fine when you are breastfeeding. However, some babies are more sensitive than others, so keep 

## a close eye on your baby to see how she reacts. It is also reassuring to know that the drugs injected for epidural blocks 

## and other types of regional anesthesia during childbirth do not pass into breast milk sufficiently to cause longterm 

## harm, though they may make your baby a little sleepy at first. In cases when general anesthesia is used, your 

## anesthesiologist or obstetrician should be informed in advance of your plans to breastfeed. 

## Most medications are safe to take during breastfeeding, but there are a few—including some nonprescription 

## substances— that may be harmful to the baby. These are not always the same medications that are dangerous for 

## pregnant women to take, so be sure to get approval for all medications from your doctor and your baby’s pediatrician. 

## Excessive alcohol or any kind of recreational drug or medication that has not been approved by your pediatrician 

## should not be indulged in, since enough of it could be passed on to your baby and cause serious harm.
