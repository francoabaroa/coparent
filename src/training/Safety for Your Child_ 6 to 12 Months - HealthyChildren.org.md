# Safety for Your Child: 6 to 12 Months 

## Did you know that hundreds of children younger than 1 year die 

## every year in the United States because of injuries — most of 

## which can be prevented? 

## Often, injuries happen because parents are not aware of what their 

## children can do. Your child is a fast learner and will suddenly be 

## able to roll over, crawl, sit, and stand. Your child may climb before 

## walking, or walk with support months before you expect. Your child 

## will grasp at almost anything and reach things he or she could not 

## reach before. 

## Falls 

## Because of your child’s new abilities, he or she will fall often. Protect your child from injury. Use gates on stairways 

## and doors. Install operable window guards on all windows above the first floor. Remove sharp-edged or hard furniture 

## from the room where your child plays. 

## Do not use a baby walker. Your child may tip it over, fall out of it, or fall down the stairs in it. Baby walkers allow 

## children to get to places where they can pull hot foods or heavy objects down on themselves. 

## If your child has a serious fall or does not act normally after a fall, call your doctor. 

## Burns 

## At 6 to 12 months children grab at everything. NEVER leave cups of hot coffee on tables or counter edges. And NEVER 

## carry hot liquids or food near your child or while holding your child. He or she could get burned. Also, if your child is 

## left to crawl or walk around stoves, wall or floor heaters, or other hot appliances, he or she is likely to get burned. A 

## safer place for your child while you are cooking, eating, or unable to provide your full attention is the playpen, crib, or 

## stationary activity center, or buckled into a high chair. 

## If your child does get burned, put cold water on the burned area immediately. Keep the burned area in cold water for a 

## few minutes to cool it off. Then cover the burn loosely with a dry bandage or clean cloth. Call your doctor for all burns. 

## To protect your child from tap water scalds, the hottest temperature at the faucet should be no more than 120°F. In 

## many cases you can adjust your water heater. 

## Make sure you have a working smoke alarm on every level of your home, especially in furnace and sleeping areas. 

## Test the alarms every month. It is best to use smoke alarms that use long-life batteries, but if you do not, change the 

## batteries at least once a year. 

## Drowning 

## At this age your child loves to play in water. Empty all the water from a bathtub, pail, or any container of water 

## immediately after use. Keep the door to the bathroom closed. NEVER leave your child alone in or near a bathtub, pail 

## of water, wading or swimming pool, or any other water, even for a moment. Drowning can happen in less than 2 inches 

## of water. Knowing how to swim does NOT mean your child is safe in or near water. Stay within an arm’s length of your 

## child around water. 

## If you have a swimming pool, now is the time to install a fence that separates the house from the pool. The pool should 

## be fenced in on all 4 sides. Most children drown when they wander out of the house and fall into a pool that is not 

## fenced off from the house. Be prepared — install a fence around your pool now, before your child begins to walk!

## Poisoning and Choking 

### Your child will explore the world by putting anything and everything into his or her mouth. NEVER leave small objects 

### or balloons in your child’s reach, even for a moment. Don’t feed your child hard pieces of food such as hot dogs, raw 

### carrots, grapes, peanuts, or popcorn. Cut all of his or her food into thin slices to prevent choking. 

### Be prepared if your child starts to choke. Learn how to save the life of a choking child. Ask your doctor to recommend 

### the steps you need to take. 

### Children will put everything into their mouths, even if it doesn’t taste good. Many ordinary things in your house can 

### be poisonous to your child. Be sure to keep household products such as cleaners, chemicals, and medicines up, up, and 

### away, completely out of sight and reach. Never store lye drain cleaners in your home. Use safety latches or locks on 

### drawers and cupboards. Remember, your child doesn’t understand or remember “no” while exploring. 

### If your child does eat something that could be poisonous, call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222 immediately. Do 

### not make your child vomit. 

## Strangulation and Suffocation 

### Place your baby’s crib away from windows. Cords from window blinds and draperies can strangle your child. Use 

### cordless window coverings, or if this is not possible, tie cords high and out of reach. Do not knot cords together. 

### Plastic wrappers and bags form a tight seal if placed over the mouth and nose and may suffocate your child. Keep 

### them away from your child. 

## And Remember Car Safety 

### Car crashes are a great danger to your child’s life and health. Most injuries and deaths caused by car crashes can be 

### prevented by the use of car safety seats EVERY TIME your child is in the car. All infants and toddlers should ride in a 

### rear-facing car safety seat as long as possible, until they reach the highest weight or height allowed by their car safety 

### seat’s manufacturer. Most convertible seats have limits that will permit a child to ride rear-facing for 2 years or more. 

### A rear-facing car safety seat should NEVER be placed in front of a passenger air bag. Your child, besides being much 

### safer in a car safety seat, will behave better so you can pay attention to your driving. The safest place for all infants and 

### children to ride is in the back seat. 

### Do not leave your child alone in a car. Keep vehicles and their trunks locked. Children who are left in a car can die of 

### heat stroke because temperatures can reach deadly levels in minutes. 

### Remember, the biggest threat to your child’s life and health is an injury.
