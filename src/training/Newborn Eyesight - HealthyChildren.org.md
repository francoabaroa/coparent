# Newborn Eyesight 

## Newborn infants generally have poor eyesight and little ability to focus beyond 6 or 10 inches away. The 

## amount of color vision is not known for certain, but infants probably do not see subtle differences in color 

## until 2 to 3 months of age. 

## Where Baby Can See Best 

## Initially, your baby may not be able to look at you and follow your face, but as she grows and remains 

## awake for longer periods, her eyesight will improve. Position your baby face-to-face about 6 to 10 inches 

## away. This is where your baby can see the best, and faces are a baby’s favorite visual stimulation. 

## Patterns and Colors 

## Babies also like objects with high contrast, such as black-and-white bull’s-eye patterns, checkerboards, and concentric circles of 

## contrasting colors. It is good for your baby to have different things to look at, and she enjoys it when you occasionally change the 

## objects in her environment. Before birth, your baby was accustomed to a dark, muted environment. 

## Preemie Eyesight 

## The fetus’ eyelids fuse ( close ) during week 10 of gestation and remain closed until about 26 weeks’ gestation. 

## If your baby is born with closed eyelids , no special precautions or treatments are necessary. The lids will open 

## on their own within a short time, or by around 26 weeks. 

## If your baby is born with fused eyelids , waiting for the lids to open can be frustrating. Although this may take 

## only a short time to happen, it can seem like forever when you are anxiously waiting to make eye contact with 

## your baby.
