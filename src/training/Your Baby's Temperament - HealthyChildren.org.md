# Your Baby's Temperament 

## Consider these two babies, both from the same family, 

## both boys: 

## The first infant is calm and quiet, happy to play by 

## himself. He watches everything that happens 

## around him, but rarely demands attention himself. 

## Left on his own, he sleeps for long periods and eats 

## infrequently. 

## The second baby is fussy and startles easily. He 

## thrashes his arms and legs, moving almost 

## constantly whether awake or asleep. While most 

## newborns sleep (/English/healthy

## living/sleep/Pages/healthy-sleep-habits-how-many-hours-does-your-child-need.aspx) 14 hours a day, he sleeps 

## only 10, and wakes up whenever there’s the slightest activity nearby. He seems in a hurry to do everything at 

## once and even eats in a rush, gulping his feedings and swallowing so much air that he needs frequent burping. 

## Both these babies are absolutely normal and healthy. One is no "better" than the other, but because their personalities 

## (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Emotional-and-Social-Development-4-7-Months.aspx) are so far apart, the two will 

## be treated very differently, right from birth. 

## Discovering unique personality traits 

## Your baby will show many unique personality traits from the earliest weeks after birth. Discovering these traits is one 

## of the most exciting parts of having a new baby. Are they very active and intense, or relatively slow-going? Are they 

## timid when faced with a new situation, such as the first bath (/English/ages-stages/baby/bathing-skin

## care/Pages/Bathing-Your-Newborn.aspx), or do they enjoy it? 

## You’ll find clues to their personality in everything they do, from falling asleep to crying (/English/ages

## stages/baby/crying-colic/pages/Responding-to-Your-Babys-Cries.aspx). The more you pay attention and respond 

## appropriately to their unique personality, the calmer and more predictable your life will be in the months to come. 

## Preemies & low birth weight babies 

## While most of these early character traits are built into the newborn’s hereditary makeup, their appearance may be 

## delayed if your baby is born quite prematurely. 

## Premature babies (/English/ages-stages/baby/preemie/Pages/default.aspx) don’t express their needs—such as 

## hunger, fatigue, or discomfort—as clearly as other newborns. They may be extra sensitive to light (/English/ages

## stages/baby/Pages/Your-Baby%27s-Vision-1-Month.aspx), sound and touch, and these stimuli may cause them to 

## become fussy and look away. When this happens, it’s up to the parent to stop and wait until the baby is alert and ready 

## for more attention. Eventually most of these early reactions will fade away, and the baby’s own natural character traits 

## will become more evident. 

## Babies who are less than 5.5 pounds or 2.5 kg at birth (low birth weight), even if they’re full term, also may be less 

## responsive than other newborns. At first they may be very sleepy and not seem very alert. After a few weeks they seem 

## to wake up, eating eagerly but still remaining irritable and hypersensitive to stimulation between feedings. This 

## irritability may last until they grow and mature further. 

## Responding to your baby's individuality 

## From the very beginning, your baby’s temperamental traits will influence the way you treat them and feel about them. 

## If you had specific ideas about child rearing, reevaluate them now to see if they’re really in tune with your baby's 

## character. The same goes for expert advice—from books, articles, and especially from well-meaning relatives and

### friends—about the "right way (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/Pages/A-Perfect-Parent.aspx)" to raise a child. 

### The truth is, there is no right way that works for every child. You have to create your own guidelines based on your 

### child’s unique personality, your own beliefs, and the circumstances of your family life (/english/family

### life/Pages/default.aspx). 

### The important thing is to remain responsive to your baby’s individuality. Don’t try to box them into some previously 

### set mold or pattern. Your baby’s uniqueness is their strength, and respecting that strength from the start will help lay 

### the best possible foundation for their self-esteem (/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/Helping-Your-Child

### Develop-A-Healthy-Sense-of-Self-Esteem.aspx) and for loving relationships with others.
