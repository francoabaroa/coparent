# Is It a Medical Emergency, or Not? 

## When your child is sick or hurt, it can be difficult to tell 

## whether an urgent care or emergency department is 

## the best choice. In making that decision, it is important 

## to stay calm and recognize the difference between a 

## medical emergency (/English/health-issues/injuries

## emergencies/Pages/When-Your-Child-Needs

## Emergency-Medical-Services.aspx) and a medical 

## situation where a different type of care may be more 

## appropriate. 

## Nonemergency Medical 

## Situations: 

## As a first step in nonemergency situations, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends calling your 

## pediatrician's office—your child's "medical home"—to discuss your child's needs. Pediatricians are very accustomed to 

## taking phone calls at all times and can often deal with problems over the phone. See Urgent Care: Is It Worth the No 

## Wait? (/English/family-life/health-management/Pages/Nonemergency-Acute-Care-AAP-Policy-Explained.aspx) for 

## more information. 

## Situations that warrant care for illness or injury, but not emergency care: 

## Minor burns 

## Earache or ear infection 

## Pink eye 

## Potential urinary tract infection (UTI) 

## Sore throats and potential strep throat 

## Rashes and mild skin infections 

## Gastrointestinal illnesses, such as vomiting and diarrhea with mild dehydration 

## Simple wounds 

## Foreign objects in ears and noses Colds and coughs 

## Allergies 

## As a first step in nonemergency situations, the American Academy of Pediatrcs recommends calling your pediatrician's office

## your child's "medical home" -to discuss your child's needs. 

## Remember, for nonemergency situations, first call your child's pediatrician. If you believe an injury or illness is 

## threatening your child's life or may cause permanent harm, go to the emergency room or call an ambulance. If your 

## child is seriously ill or injured, it is safer for your child to be transported to the emergency department by ambulance. 

## Emergency Medical Situations: 

## A trip to the emergency room is the best place for treating severe injuries or life-threatening illnesses. As a rule, if 

## your child can walk, talk, interact, and play, chances are whatever she or he has is not an emergency. See 10 Things for
