# Putting Back-Sleeping Concerns to Rest 

## By: Laura A. Jana, MD, FAAP & Jennifer Shu, MD, FAAP 

## We're willing to bet that this isn't the first time you've 

## been introduced to the benefits of raising a back

## sleeping baby. Most new parents today are well 

## informed when it comes to SIDS and why back sleeping 

## is so strongly recommended. We'd be remiss, however, 

## if we didn't acknowledge the fact that you may find 

## yourself with some practical concerns when faced with 

## putting principle into practice. For the most part, the 

## following concerns cause parents to worry 

## unnecessarily: 

## Not sleeping "well." One of the primary concerns (and observations) parents often have is that their babies don't 

## sleep as well on their backs. While it is true that back sleeping babies are likely to wake more frequently, what's 

## most important to understand is that their easier arousability is actually the reason why back sleeping is safer 

## than belly sleeping. While it is certainly understandable for new parents to dream of sleeping longer, you can 

## rest assured that this will come in good time. For now, just remind yourself that you don't want it to come at the 

## expense of your baby's safety. 

## Spit up & vomiting. The most common concern we hear is the understandable but unfounded fear that babies 

## will spit up and choke while on their backs. Fortunately, several reassuring studies, as well as the test of time, 

## have demonstrated that healthy babies put to sleep on their backs are able to turn their heads and/or protect 

## their airways if and when they spit up. And, while it may seem surprising, babies' anatomy actually makes 

## choking more likely when lying on their bellies. Finally, back sleeping babies are no more likely to have 

## breathing or digestive-related problems than their belly-sleeping counterparts of years past. 

## Flat heads (sometimes referred to as positional skull deformities or positional plagiocephaly 

## (/English/health-issues/conditions/Cleft-Craniofacial/Pages/Positional-Skull-Deformities-and

## Torticollis.aspx)). While there has been a documented increase in the number of babies "walking" with flat 

## heads since back sleeping came into vogue, the fact of the matter is that it really does not pose much of a 

## problem for most back-sleeping babies. In large part, that's because you have a good deal of control over the 

## situation. It's important to understand that the shape of a newborn's head is not set in stone and can be affected 

## by spending a lot of time in any given position. So, it is important to simply remember to try to alternate the 

## direction your baby faces each time they lie on their back—both while asleep and when awake. By offering your 

## newborn plenty of tummy time and time spent in positions other than flat on their back while they are awake, 

## you can also help decrease the likelihood of a flat or misshapen head. 

## Delayed milestones. Some of you will undoubtedly hear or read that back sleeping has been associated with 

## delayed motor development. In addressing the question of delayed milestones—or more specifically, a delay in 

## the time when back-sleeping babies first begin to roll over—rest assured that this all seems to even out in the 

## end. Even if your baby doesn't take to rolling quite as early as their belly-sleeping counterparts of generations 

## past and present, to our knowledge no college application has ever asked applicants how early they mastered the 

## ability to roll over (or, for future reference, sit, crawl, walk or toilet train). When it comes to strengthening the 

## muscles your baby needs to roll and, at the same time, decreasing your baby's chances of ending up with a flat 

## head, just be aware that both can be easily accomplished by allowing your baby plenty of time on their belly when 

## they're awake. 

## Why side-sleeping is not a good idea for babies 

## In the early days of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) prevention, both back sleeping and side sleeping were 

## considered to be acceptably safe sleep options for babies. However, subsequent concerns about the safety of side 

## sleeping—fueled by the finding that it doubles the risk of SIDS as compared to back sleeping—led to the current

##### recommendation for exclusive back sleeping. That said, some parents have turned to wedge-like cushions, often 

##### referred to as sleep positioners. Whether they have unwarranted concerns about spitting up, are worried about flat 

##### heads, or simply think side sleeping is safe, it's simply not a good idea. 

### Skip sleep positioners & wedges 

##### Unfortunately, devices designed to maintain sleep position have not been sufficiently tested for their safety or 

##### effectiveness. In addition, they are often made of soft material or memory foam, both of which have no place inside a 

##### baby's crib or near a baby's face. For any devices that made medical claims, the US Food and Drug Administration 

##### (FDA) has required their removal from the market. Regarding any sleep positioners that remain, both the American 

##### Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the FDA recommend that parents never use them.
