# Establishing a Breastfeeding Routine 

## It is such a joy to observe an infant’s responses to the 

## world. As you watch your newborn gaze in wonder at 

## the people and objects around them, nestle against you 

## with a whimper of pleasure, and occasionally startle in 

## response to a loud noise, you may feel that you’re 

## experiencing many of the wide range of emotions 

## yourself. During the first days and weeks at home with a 

## new baby, you may swing between feelings of joy and 

## uncertainty, confidence and confusion, excitement and 

## exasperation. These are all very natural and expected 

## feelings. If your emotional responses during the 

## postpartum period are more extreme than you 

## expected or feel you can handle, talk with your 

## physician. 

## In general, the simpler and more predictable you can keep your daily routine as you continue getting to know your 

## baby and familiarizing yourself with breastfeeding, the better for you and your family. 

## Find some favorite spots 

## Though one of the great advantages of breastfeeding is its adaptability—you can feed your baby practically anywhere 

## without equipment and without delay—you might find that choosing one or two favorite places for breastfeeding at 

## first will make your adjustment easier. During the day, you might opt for a sofa or chair in the living room or kitchen, 

## since this allows you to take part in family life as you nurse. Some new mothers find that breastfeeding in bed, with 

## plenty of pillows for support and their baby’s bassinet waiting close by, allows the baby to drift off comfortably to sleep 

## at the end of the nursing session and makes it easier for the mother to nap. 

## Nursing mothers in many cultures sleep with their babies until they wean. However, bed sharing can be hazardous to 

## your baby. Bed sharing is a particular concern if the mother is obese; if she is using any substances that may alter her 

## state of arousal, such as mind-altering drugs or excessive alcohol; if she is a smoker; or if other children are also in the 

## bed. If you decide to breastfeed your baby in bed, move them back to their bassinet, on their back, once they're done 

## and before you drift off to sleep. It is also risky (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/Safe-Sleep-Charlies

## Story.aspx) to fall asleep with your infant on a couch or in a reclining chair. The American Academy of Pediatrics 

## recommends parents have their new babies sleep in the same room as the parents, but on a separate sleep surface, 

## such as a bassinet. 

## Set up essentials nearby 

## Once you’ve picked a couple of locations for breastfeeding, make sure that such essentials as baby wipes and diapers 

## are within reach before you start nursing. Keep a bottle of water or something else to drink nearby for you, as nursing 

## mothers should drink plenty of water or other noncaffeinated beverages to avoid thirst. 

## If you have older children, a basket of toys, workbooks, or audio recordings can keep you from having to get up in the 

## middle of a breastfeeding session. You might also keep a pad and pencil within reach to track your baby’s feedings. 

## Of course, you won’t necessarily need every one of these items, nor do you need to create a formal "nursing area" to 

## breastfeed successfully. However, thinking ahead about what you might want nearby can make life more manageable 

## in the early days.
