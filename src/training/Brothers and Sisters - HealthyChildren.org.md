## What are the factors that influence your child's personality and other attributes? Two major 

## influences are at work: nature (genetic factors, heredity) and nurture (experience). These 

## interact with each other in ways that are particular to each child. To better understand the 

## similarities and differences among siblings, let's look at both of these factors more closely. 

## Nature 

## Because of heredity—the biological or genetic influences of the same two parents on each child— 

## parents might expect their children to be alike. But overall, children have only about a fifty-fifty 

## chance of developing any particular inherited trait (physical appearance, personality, intelligence, aptitudes, health), 

## and even when these traits are present, they can vary. 

## For instance, researchers have found that siblings tend to be more similar in their physical characteristics than in 

## their likelihood of developing the same diseases. Also, while siblings may resemble one another in their intellectual 

## aptitude and other psychological characteristics early in life, these similarities generally diminish by adulthood, while 

## differences become more pronounced. Even in childhood, siblings with similar levels of intelligence may differ in 

## their school achievement, since academic success can be strongly affected by the different life experiences of each 

## child. 

## Nurture 

## Nurture (or experience) refers to the nonhereditary influences on your child's development. They include social 

## factors such as relationships with siblings, peers, parents, and other adults, as well as environmental influences like ill

## nesses, accidents, nutrition, and cultural experiences. Other forces come into play as well, including your child's 

## perceptions of herself and others, past experiences, self-expectations, and the expectations others have of her. 

## Siblings share some experiences but have many others that are not shared. While shared experiences generally 

## contribute toward similarities, even a shared experience may affect each child differently. And since most experiences 

## are unshared, they contribute to differences between children too. 

## In the early school years, for instance, qualities such as intelligence and academic achievement are largely 

## determined by heredity and shared experience. However, as children grow, they have more unshared experiences, 

## which gradually help differentiate one sibling from another. Siblings even perceive and interpret shared events 

## differently, and these different perceptions can be important in shaping a child's development and self-image.
