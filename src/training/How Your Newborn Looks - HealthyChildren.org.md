# How Your Newborn Looks 

## As you relax with your new baby, unwrap the blankets 

## and examine your little one from head to toe. You'll 

## notice many details that may have escaped you in the 

## moments after birth: 

## Eyes 

## While many Caucasian newborns have blue eyes, this 

## may change over the first year. If a baby's eyes are going 

## to turn brown, they'll probably become "muddy"

## looking during the first six months. However, if they're 

## still blue at that time, they'll probably remain this color 

## (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Newborn-Eye

## Color.aspx). In contrast, infants with dark-skinned heritage generally have brown eyes at birth, and tend to retain that 

## color throughout life. 

## You may notice a blood-red spot in the whites of one or both of your newborn's eyes. This spot, as well as the general 

## puffiness of a newborn's face, is most commonly caused by pressures exerted during labor. Although you might find 

## them a bit worrisome, both tend to fade in a few days. If your baby was delivered by C-section, she may not have this 

## puffiness and the whites of her eyes likely will not have any red spots. 

## Skin 

## At birth your baby's skin will seem very delicate. Whether your child is born early, late, or on time, peeling skin is 

## normal and usually requires no treatment. All babies, including those with a dark-skinned heritage, have lighter

## appearing skin at birth. This gradually darkens as they become older. 

## As you examine your baby's shoulders and back, you may notice fine hair, called lanugo. This hair is produced toward 

## the end of pregnancy; however, it's usually shed before birth or soon thereafter. If your baby was born before her due 

## date, she is more likely to still have this hair, and it may take a couple of weeks to disappear. 

## You also may notice various spots and marks on your baby's skin. Some, like those appearing around the diaper edges, 

## may be due to pressure. Mottled or blotchy-looking patches are commonly caused by exposure to cool air and will 

## disappear quickly if you cover her again. If you find scratches, particularly on your baby's face, it's a good reminder it's 

## time to trim her fingernails. For some new parents, this can be a nerve-racking task, so don't hesitate to ask advice 

## from a nurse at the hospital nursery, your pediatrician's office, or anyone else with experience trimming babies' nails. 


### Some of the most common skin markings (/English/ages-stages/baby/bathing

### skin-care/Pages/Your-Newborns-Skin-Birthmarks-and-Rashes.aspx) in 

### newborns: 

##### Salmon patches or "Stork Bites." Distributed over areas where a stork supposedly would carry a baby in its beak, 

##### "stork bites" are patches, light to deep pink in color, most commonly located on the bridge of the nose, lower 

##### forehead, upper eyelids, back of the head, and/or the neck. They are the most common birthmark, especially in light

##### skinned babies. Also called "angel kisses," they typically fade over the first few months to years but may become 

##### apparent later in life with flushing. 

##### Slate gray macules. These birthmarks vary considerably in size, but all are flat areas of skin containing extra 

##### pigment, causing a brown, gray, or even blue (like a bruise) appearance. Most often located on the back or buttocks, 

##### these spots are very common, especially in dark-skinned babies. They usually disappear before school age and are of 

##### no medical significance. 

##### Pustular melanosis. These are small blisters that typically appear at birth, then peel and dry up within a couple of 

##### days, leaving dark spots like freckles that usually disappear over several weeks. Some newborns may have only the 

##### spots, indicating they had the rash before birth. While pustular melanosis is common (particularly in babies with 

##### darker skin) and is a harmless newborn rash, it is always important to have all blister-like rashes evaluated by your 

##### baby's doctor to rule out infection. 

##### Milia. These tiny white bumps or yellow spots are found on the cheeks, on the chin, or across the tip of the nose, and 

##### are caused by skin gland secretion. This common newborn rash generally disappears on its own within the first two 

##### to three weeks after birth. 

##### Miliaria. Often referred to as "heat rash" or "prickly heat," miliaria most often occurs in hot, humid climates or 

##### when babies are too bundled up. The rash can contain tiny sweat blisters and/or small red bumps. It shows up most 

##### often in skin folds and covered areas, and usually goes away within a few days. 

##### Erythema toxicum. Often called "E. tox" for short, this rash is very common and usually appears within the first few 

##### days after birth. It consists of multiple red splotches with yellowish white bumps in the center, which come and go 

##### days after birth and completely resolve in a week or so. 

##### Capillary hemangiomas. These raised red spots are caused by a strawberry-like collection of blood vessels in the 

##### skin. For the first week or so, they may appear white or pale, then turn red and raised later. While they often enlarge 

##### during the first year, most shrink and many disappear by school age. 

##### Port wine stain. These large, flat, and irregularly shaped dark red or purple areas are caused by extra blood vessels 

##### under the skin. Port wine stains are usually located on the face or neck but, unlike hemangiomas, don't disappear 

##### without treatment. These birthmarks can be treated, sometimes with laser surgery, by either a plastic surgeon or a 

##### pediatric dermatologist. 

## Head & hair 

##### When born, babies may have an elongated shape (/English/health-issues/conditions/Cleft

##### Craniofacial/Pages/Positional-Skull-Deformities-and-Torticollis.aspx)of their head, and may also have scalp swelling 

##### in the area pushed out first during birth. If you press gently on this area, your finger may even leave a small 

##### indentation. This swelling (called "caput") is not serious and should disappear in a few days. 

##### Sometimes there may be swelling under a newborn's scalp, present on one or both sides, which is firm or springs right 

#### back after it is gently pressed. This type of swelling is likely a cephalohematoma, and is caused by the intense pressure 

##### on the head during labor. While not serious, it represents some bleeding along the outer side of the skull bonesâ€”(not 

##### inside the brain) and usually takes six to ten weeks to disappear. 

#### All babies have two soft spots, or fontanelles, on the head. These are the areas where the immature bones of the skull 

##### are still growing together. The larger opening is toward the front; a smaller one is at the back. Parents needn't be afraid 

##### to touch these areas gently, as there is a thick, durable membrane that protects the brain. 

##### Babies are born with hair, but the amount, texture, and color vary from one newborn to another. Most, if not all, "baby 

##### hair" falls out during the first six months and is replaced by mature hair. The color and texture of the mature hair may 

##### be different from the hair the baby was born with.

## Chest & tummy 

##### In the first few weeks following birth, babies can be affected by their mother's hormones they were exposed to during 

##### pregnancy. As a result, babies' breasts may be enlarged temporarily, and they might even secrete a few drops of milk. 

##### This is normal. It may occur in boys and girls, and normally lasts less than a week, although it can last longer. It is best 

##### not to press or squeeze a baby's breasts, since this won't reduce swelling and could cause irritation. In infant girls, 

##### there could be a discharge from the vagina, often white mucus and sometimes containing a little blood. Although 

##### disconcerting to some new parents, this so-called pseudomenses is harmless. 

##### Your baby's abdomen may seem prominent, and you may even notice a small area that seems to bulge during crying 

##### spells. This bulge is called a hernia. Small hernias are most commonly seen around the umbilical cord (belly button) 

##### but may also appear in a line down the center of the abdomen. 

## Diaper area 

##### The genitals of newborn babies can be reddish and seem large for bodies so small. The scrotum of a baby boy may be 

##### small and smooth, or it might be large and wrinkled. The testicles can appear to move in and out of the scrotum, and 

##### sometimes will move as far up as the base of the penis or even to the crease between the thigh and belly. As long as the 

##### testicles are located in the scrotum most of the time, the fact that they move around is normal. 

##### Some boys have a buildup of fluid in a sac called a hydrocele inside the scrotum. This buildup will shrink gradually 

##### without treatment over several months as the fluid is reabsorbed by the body. If the scrotum swells suddenly or gets 

##### larger when he cries, notify your pediatrician; this could be a sign of an inguinal hernia, which requires treatment. 

##### At birth, a baby boy's foreskin is attached to the head, or glans, of the penis, and cannot be pushed back as it can in 

##### older boys and men. There is a small opening at the tip through which urine flows. If the baby is circumcised, the 

##### connections between the foreskin and the glans are separated and the foreskin is removed, leaving the head of the 

##### penis visible. Without a circumcision, the foreskin will separate from the glans naturally during the first few years.
