# Developmental Milestones: 1 Month 

## What are some of the developmental milestones my 

## child should reach by one month of age? 

## In the very beginning, it may seem that your baby does nothing but eat (/English/ages

## stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/default.aspx), sleep (/English/ages

## stages/baby/sleep/Pages/default.aspx), cry (/English/ages-stages/baby/crying

## colic/Pages/default.aspx), and fill his diapers (/english/ages-stages/baby/diapers

## clothing/Pages/default.aspx). By the end of the first month, he’ll be much more alert and 

## responsive. Gradually he’ll begin moving his body more smoothly and with much greater coordination 

## (/English/ages-stages/toddler/Pages/Movement-and-Coordination.aspx)—especially in getting his hand to his mouth. 

## You’ll realize that he listens when you speak, watches you as you hold him, and occasionally moves his own body to 

## respond to you or attract your attention.
