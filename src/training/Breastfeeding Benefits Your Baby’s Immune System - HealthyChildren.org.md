# Breastfeeding Benefits Your Baby’s Immune System 

## By: Claire McCarthy, MD, FAAP 

## Breast milk is the food naturally designed to best meet 

## the needs of human babies. It has all the necessary 

## nutrients, in just the right amounts, and is easy to 

## digest. Beyond the nutritional benefits, here's a great 

## bonus: Breast milk also helps build and support your 

## baby's immune system. Read on to learn how. 

## Breast milk: food & infection 

## fighter 

## Breast milk contains antibodies that can fight infection. Those antibodies are present in high amounts in colostrum 

## (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Colostrum-Your-Babys-First-Meal.aspx), the first milk that comes 

## out of the breasts after birth. However, there are antibodies in breastmilk the entire time a mother continues to nurse. 

## Through these antibodies, the mother can pass on some protection from infectious illness she had in the past, and 

## those she gets while breastfeeding. Breast milk can literally give babies a head start in preventing and fighting 

## infections. 

## Breast milk also is made up of other proteins, fats, sugars and even white blood cells that work to fight infection in 

## many different ways. They are especially helpful in fighting gastrointestinal infections, since breast milk heads right 

## to the stomach and intestine when your baby eats. The different factors in breast milk work directly within the 

## intestine before being absorbed and reaching the entire body. This also sets the stage for a protective and balanced 

## immune system that helps recognize and fight infections and other diseases even after breastfeeding ends. 

## Other factors in breast milk directly stimulate and support the immune system. These include lactoferrin and 

## interleukin-6, -8 and -10. These proteins help to balance the immune system inflammatory response, which is needed 

## for immune function but can be damaging in excess. 

## There's even evidence that nursing mothers who are vaccinated against COVID-19 can pass along antibodies to the 

## virus through breast milk. Although it's not proven, these antibodies may help protect babies too young (/English/tips

## tools/ask-the-pediatrician/Pages/when-can-children-get-the-COVID-19-vaccine.aspx) for the vaccine. (See 

## Breastfeeding During the COVID-19 Pandemic (/English/health-issues/conditions/COVID-19/Pages/Breastfeeding

## During-COVID-19.aspx) .") 

## Is breastmilk probiotic? 

## Breast milk has "probiotic" factors, too. Some support the immune system and others serve as a nutrient source for 

## healthy bacteria in the body, called the human microbiome. The healthy microbiome can play a lifelong role in not 

## only preventing infection, but also in decreasing the risk of allergies, asthma (/English/health

## issues/conditions/allergies-asthma/Pages/default.aspx), obesity (/English/health

## issues/conditions/obesity/Pages/default.aspx) and other chronic diseases. 

## With all these immunity-boosting factors in breast milk, it is not surprising that breastfed babies are less likely to 

## suffer from ear infections, vomiting, diarrhea, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and certain types of meningitis 

## (/English/health-issues/conditions/head-neck-nervous-system/Pages/Meningitis.aspx). Research also shows that 

## children who nurse for more than six months are less likely to develop childhood leukemia and lymphoma 

## (/English/health-issues/conditions/cancer/Pages/Childhood-Cancer.aspx) than those who receive formula. This may 

## be in part because these types of cancer are affected by disruptions to the immune system.

## Remember 

#### To help keep babies healthy, communities can take steps to support mothers who choose to breastfeed their babies. 

#### This can include offering paid leave and giving employees places and time to pump breast milk. If you're 

#### breastfeeding your baby or have any questions, never hesitate to talk with your pediatrician. If you can't breastfeed, or 

#### for personal reasons choose not to, talk to your pediatrician about the many other ways to support your baby's health.
