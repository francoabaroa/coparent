# Your Family Rituals 

## Every family should have activities that they enjoy together and that become a regular, 

## predictable, and integral part of their lives. Some can be serious pursuits, like attending 

## community functions or religious services as a family; others can be more lighthearted, like 

## going fishing. Whatever they are, they can help bond a family together. These are some rituals 

## that many families have made parts of their lives: 

## Important Conversations 

## Communication between parents and children should be a top priority in your family. Set aside 

## time to talk, discussing the day's and the week's activities, sharing feelings and really listening to one another. 

## Respect the privacy of each of your youngsters as they begin to assert their independence during these middle years; 

## they may have certain problems and difficulties they may not want to divulge to their brothers and sisters. You should 

## be able to have a one-on-one conversation with each child without all the other children listening to it. If you honor 

## his wishes for confidentiality, this can build trust between you. 

## Some families establish a weekly time for a family meeting. When everyone is present, family issues, relationships, 

## plans, and experiences are discussed, and everyone from the youngest to the oldest gets a chance to be heard and to 

## participate. 

## Recreation and Cultural Activities 

## Family recreation is an important way to strengthen the family. Sports (participation and spectator), games, movies, 

## and walks in the park are good ways to increase cohesiveness and reduce stress. 

## Cultural activities can be valuable too. Visits to museums, libraries, plays, musicals, and concerts can expand the 

## family's horizons and deepen appreciation for the arts. 

## Shopping 

## Shopping trips can provide regular opportunities for parents and children to spend time together. Whether you are 

## grocery shopping or buying birthday gifts, these excursions can be fun and exciting for youngsters in middle 

## childhood. Let your children make lists, find items in the store, carry the bags to the car, and unpack them once you 

## return home. Allowing your child some choices and assigning some meaningful responsibilities can help build his 

## self-confidence. 

## Reading and Singing Aloud 

## Reading and singing aloud as a family promotes feelings of closeness and an appreciation for music and books. 

## Parents should find out what stories their children like to read, and what music they like to listen to. It is lots of fun to 

## take turns reading aloud, and to let the children hear the stories and songs you enjoyed when you were growing up. 

## Holiday Traditions 

## These are another source of fun family activities. By learning about the history, significance, and rituals of a particular 

## holiday, children will feel a greater sense of involvement in the holiday preparations and celebrations. 

## Spiritual Pursuits 

## For many families, religion plays an important role in providing a moral tradition, a set of values, and a network of 

## friends and neighbors who can provide support. Attending services is something family members can do together. 

## You do not necessarily need to go to a church, synagogue, or other place of worship regularly, however, to share moral 

## values with your children and help them develop a sense of their history and the continuity of the family. Many 

## families develop a strong spiritual life without the formal structure of organized religion.
