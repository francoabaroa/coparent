# Returning To Work 

## Ideally, preparation for your return to work as a breastfeeding mother should begin long before 

## you have your baby. While you are still pregnant, ask your supervisor or your company’s human 

## resources department for information on the company’s policies and history regarding all issues 

## relating to a breastfeeding employee’s return to work. 

## Ideally, this may include any or all of the following: flexible work schedules, extended maternity 

## leave, onsite child care (so the mother can make frequent short visits to breastfeed), bringing the 

## baby to the office to breastfeed, and provisions for a private place and regular breaks for 

## expressing milk for later use. 

## Your Rights 

## As part of the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, section 4207 says that employers with fifty 

## employees or more must provide nursing mothers with “reasonable break time” and a private space that isn’t a 

## bathroom to pump milk until the employee’s baby is twelve months old. Companies with fewer than fifty employees 

## are also supposed to comply with the law unless they can show that doing so would cause undue hardship or expense. 

## In addition, many states have passed laws protecting the rights of breastfeeding women in the workplace. In New York, 

## for example, companies are legally mandated to provide mothers with a place and time to breastfeed or express milk 

## for their babies. Elsewhere, an increasing number of employers voluntarily provide private rooms for breastfeeding 

## mothers and even allow the baby to be brought to the work site to nurse. Larger corporations may provide one or 

## more breast pumps on-site for all their breastfeeding employees—selling or giving each such employee a personal kit 

## that connects to the pump. In some cases, a lactation specialist is provided to answer questions and help employees 

## learn how to use the pump and maintain their milk supply while back on the job. In short, you may be surprised at 

## what options are available to you. Talk with other mothers at your company about what they have been able to 

## arrange. If not much has been provided for breastfeeding workers in the past, perhaps you and any other concerned 

## employees can volunteer to help establish these lactation support services. 

## Location 

## The ideal location for expressing milk would have a sink for washing hands and breastpump parts, a comfortable chair 

## with a table or desk to use for pumping, an electrical outlet, a refrigerator for storing the milk during the daytime, and 

## a lock on the door. (You will also need a portable cooler—the kind with a shoulder strap works best—with ice packs to 

## keep the milk chilled as you carry it home.) 

## Of course, many women express milk or breastfeed at work in less-than-ideal situations. If you have a private office, 

## you can install a half-size or quarter-size compact (dormitory-type) refrigerator, available for sale or rent at relatively 

## low cost, and wash your hands and pump parts in the ladies’ room. (After work, take the pump parts home to be 

## cleaned.) Many women obtain permission to install a table, chair, and refrigerator in a storage closet or other unused 

## space, and they hang a Privacy Please sign on the doorknob if the door has no lock. If you do not have access to a 

## refrigerator, you can store your milk in a small portable cooler with ice packs. Be sure to place the milk in the 

## refrigerator or freezer as soon as you return home. 

## Your Schedule 

## You must also consider how you can schedule time for pumping or breastfeeding sessions during the workday. You’ll 

## probably need to express milk every three to four hours, around the times that your baby would normally breastfeed. 

## Each session will last about fifteen to twenty minutes, though you should plan for slightly more time at first while you 

## are adjusting to this new situation (the less time pressure you feel while pumping, the easier your milk expression is 

## likely to be). Your traditional employee breaks and part of your lunchtime may provide you with the time you need. If 

## not, you will have to ask for a little extra time, volunteering to make up that time in the morning or at the end of the 

## day. If you foresee any potential scheduling problems or conflicts with other employees, come up with solutions ahead

### of time and enlist your co-workers’ support. The idea is to demonstrate to the people who work with you that as a 

### nursing mother, you will maintain your standard work productivity. As long as others are reassured about this, they 

### will be more likely to accommodate your needs during this time. 

### When you meet with your supervisor, lay out your plans simply and clearly. Describe any agreements you have made 

### with coworkers about break times. If you know of other women who have pumped or expressed milk or breastfed at 

### your company, refer to their experience to demonstrate that your solutions and concerns are sound. You might also 

### provide information on the advantages of breastfeeding (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/pages/Benefits-of

### Breastfeeding-for-Mom.aspx) for mother, baby, and business obtained from the United States Breastfeeding 

### Committee, the American Academy of Pediatrics, or La Leche League websites. Most mothers find that their 

### employers are willing to provide both a private space and use of break time. Once you and your supervisor have 

### worked out the logistics of your breastfeeding plan, write them down in memo form and ask your supervisor to initial 

### it an give you a copy. This will prevent any confusion or conflicts when you return to work. 

## Good for Business 

### Housed within the National Women’s Health Information Center (www.womenshealth.gov) is a program called the 

### Business Case for Breastfeeding aimed at educating employers on the benefits of providing support to nursing 

### mothers in the workplace. The Business Case for Breastfeeding website has information for both workers and 

### employers on creating a lactation-friendly workplace as well as resources for support in the community. It also 

### provides facts and figures on the economic benefits to the company, or “return on investment.” These include: 

### One-day absences to care for an ill child occur more than twice as often for women who formula-feed their 

### infants compared to those who breastfeed. 

### Companies with lactation support programs had an employee retention rate of 94.2 percent. Companies without 

### lactation support programs had a retention rate of 59 percent. 

### For every $1 spent by the company on a comprehensive lactation program, the company saved $3. The materials 

### produced to support the Business Case for Breastfeeding are available online. Through federal grants, most 

### states have offered comprehensive training in promoting the Business Case for Breastfeeding to employers.
