# Brush, Book, Bed: How to Structure Your Child’s Nighttime 

# Routine 

## Brush, Book, Bed, a program of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), has a simple and clear 

## message for parents: 

## 1. Each night, help your children to brush their teeth. 

## 2. Read a favorite book (or two)! 

## 3. Get to bed at a regular time each night. 

## Having a predictable nighttime routine will help them understand and learn to expect what 

## comes next. Additionally, routines may ease the stress that some families experience at nighttime. 

## The resources below will help you get started with your child's Brush, Book, Bed routine! 

## All young children need help with brushing from an adult to make sure a good job is done. When possible, teach 

## children to spit out extra toothpaste, but don't rinse with water first. The little bit of toothpaste left behind is good for 

## their teeth! Once teeth touch, they can also be flossed. Visit your dentist (/English/family-life/health

## management/pediatric-specialists/Pages/What-is-a-Pediatric-Dentist.aspx) regularly starting with your child's first 

## birthday or sooner if there are concerns. Your pediatrician can answer questions about oral health, too. Remember, 

## the last thing to touch the teeth before bed is the toothbrush! 

## As soon as baby is born , you can start good oral health practices. If possible, use a soft washcloth to wipe your 

## baby's gums after feedings. Remember not to put babies to bed with a bottle filled with milk. And, when it is time 

## to introduce solids, choose healthy foods to reduce the risk of tooth decay (/English/ages-stages/baby/teething

## tooth-care/Pages/Preventing-Tooth-Decay.aspx). 

## For children under age 3: As soon as you see a tooth in your baby's mouth you can start to BRUSH! Use a smear 

## (grain of rice) of toothpaste with fluoride 2 times per day. 

## For children ages 3–6: Use a pea-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste. It is OK to let them practice with the 

## brush, but you get your turn too.

### After toothbrushing and before bed, find a comfortable spot to sit and read with your child. Spending some time, even 

### just 15 minutes each day, to read aloud together will help improve your child's language development and social

### emotional skills. Make up your own stories, use silly voices, sing songs, and just enjoy this special bonding time with 

### your child. Visit your local library or bookstore, and give your child the opportunity to explore different kinds of 

### books. 

### Remember, it is never too early to share books with your child. As your child ages, so will the kind of books he or 

### she enjoys. Take a look at these tips for sharing books with your child at each stage of development!

### Sleep is very important to your child's health and well-being. In fact, good sleep habits start from birth. However, 

### getting young children to sleep (and to stay asleep) is often one of the most daunting tasks of parenthood. Regardless 

### of your child's age, the key is to have a predictable series of steps that help him wind down from the day. 

### Set regular bedtimes (and, if appropriate, nap times) and stick to them. Do not wait for your child to start rubbing his 

### eyes or yawning — that's probably too late. Putting your child to bed even 15 to 20 minutes earlier can make a big 

### difference and ensure everyone has a good night's rest.
