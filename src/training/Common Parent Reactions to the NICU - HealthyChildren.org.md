# Common Parent Reactions to the NICU 

## The NICU is a wealth of sensory input. You may be overwhelmed by the amount of equipment. 

## Many of these machines have unique operating noises and alarms that may frighten you or make 

## you feel something is not right with your baby. The NICU staff are specially trained to interpret 

## and respond to any concerning alarms and explain what they mean. As you spend more time in 

## the NICU, you too will begin to distinguish among various alarm sounds. 

## Depending on the time of day, the unit may be a flurry of activity. More people tend to be in the 

## NICU during the day because this is when most physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician 

## assistants make rounds (visit each patient) and most diagnostic testing is performed. Many 

## different health care providers involved in your baby’s care will introduce themselves to you. Don’t worry about 

## remembering their names or what they do. 

## The staff understand that you are taking in a lot of new information and will continue to introduce themselves as you 

## get to know each other and develop your NICU partnership. 

## Parents report a range of reactions and emotions following their first moments in the NICU. How you feel may depend 

## on whether you were expecting your infant to need NICU care after birth, your baby’s condition, your own condition, 

## and if you have had any past NICU experience. 

## Fear 

## Fear is a normal reaction to the unknown. Most parents have little previous experience with sick newborns; many are 

## uncomfortable in the NICU environment and concerned about their baby. They may also fear the possibility of serious 

## illness, disability, or even death. They may even begin to question their own abilities to take care of this ill or 

## premature baby. 

## Some parents also fear their friends’ and relatives’ responses to the birth. Mothers sometimes fear their partner will 

## blame them for a complicated birth and fear the loss of the relationship. Often mothers feel that their mother or their 

## partner’s mother is judging them as responsible for the baby’s problems. It helps to know that most pregnancy and 

## birth complications are not anyone’s “fault” and many NICU admissions are unforeseen. Fears and misgivings usually 

## decrease over time, but most NICU parents feel apprehensive in the early part of their NICU stay. 

## Anger 

## Anger is also a common reaction to the initial NICU experience. Many parents feel angry at the hospital staff—both 

## the labor and delivery staff and the NICU staff. You may feel angry that your birth experience did not go as expected, or 

## you may be angry at your inability to control events in the NICU (“They just don’t know what they’re doing.”), at your 

## family and friends (“They just don’t understand.”), and even your partner (“How can he go to work and just forget 

## about the baby?”). You may even be angry at yourself (“Why couldn’t I carry this baby to term?” or “What did I do/not 

## do to make this happen to my baby?”). As uncomfortable as it may be, you may also feel angry at your baby (“Why 

## couldn’t you have waited for just a few more weeks?”). 

## Most parents of NICU babies feel some anger, and they express it in different ways. Some are openly angry, 

## demanding, and looking to blame others. Some want to retreat or run and keep their anger hidden inside. It may be 

## difficult to acknowledge any anger, especially if that anger is directed toward your baby or partner. 

## To cope with anger, begin by acknowledging it to yourself, your partner, and those around you. Realize that anger is a 

## normal, expected emotion common to most NICU parents. By discussing your feelings with NICU staff, you may begin 

## to understand why you feel this way. Are you upset with someone in particular, or is the situation itself the problem? 

## By discussing your feelings, you can begin to make a plan to address the problems you want to confront or things you 

## want to try to change. 


#### Anger requires a tremendous amount of energy. As NICU parents, you will spend a great amount of energy just getting 

#### through each day—getting to and from the hospital, absorbing the vast amounts of information you receive, spending 

#### time with your baby, caring for yourself and your household, and coping with the common emotional ups and downs 

#### of having an ill or premature baby. Dealing with your anger can give you more energy to care for yourself and your 

#### baby. 

## Guilt 

### “It took us a long time to resolve our guilt. We asked the ‘what if’ and ‘why us’ questions for months. But we did 

### nothing wrong. We had good prenatal care. What happened to us was nobody’s fault.” 

#### Most parents express feelings of guilt after the birth of a sick or premature baby. You may ask yourself, “What did I do 

#### to cause this?” or “What could I have done to prevent this?” And nearly every parent unnecessarily laments, “If only I 

#### hadn’t....” Mothers, especially, examine their lives since the day they became pregnant—wondering if they could have 

#### changed the outcome by making different decisions or if their circumstances had been different. 

#### For most babies in the NICU, the reasons they were born sick or premature are not known. If necessary, let go of guilty 

#### feelings, which will give you more energy to care for yourself and your new baby. It is also important to try and share 

#### these feelings with the NICU team. Often the NICU team can provide answers and comfort. 

## Loss 

#### Throughout your pregnancy, you probably had an image of your baby. For most parents, this picture was that of a 

#### healthy full-term infant. Seeing your premature or ill baby for the first time may lead to feelings of loss for what you 

#### had expected. Most mothers of term infants report that they are glad their pregnancy is over; however, mothers of 

#### premature babies often mourn the end of their pregnancy. Mothers of premature babies frequently find that they 

#### miss feeling the baby inside of them and did not feel ready to give birth. Neonatal intensive care unit mothers may 

#### also feel jealous of women who are still pregnant, or of mothers who have given birth to healthy term babies. 

#### If your birth didn’t happen as you planned, you and your partner may also mourn the loss of that planned birth 

#### experience. Many couples today plan who will attend the birth, how the environment will look, how they will manage 

#### the labor process, and how much medical intervention they desire. Some write detailed birth plans to convey their 

#### desires to their care providers. Unfortunately, your preterm or complicated birth may have required an abrupt, 

#### unplanned change to your experience. 

#### You may also feel the loss of your parenting role. Throughout pregnancy, you envisioned yourself as a parent. You 

#### pictured yourself and your partner playing with and caring for your baby. Now you must spend time with your baby in 

#### a foreign environment, touch your baby through an incubator porthole, and wait for someone else to tell you when it’s 

#### appropriate for you to hold or feed your baby. Letting go of what has been lost is an important part of your transition to 

#### parenthood. Now you must develop a new dream of your growing family and different goals for marking progress. 

#### These new goals may be quite different (such as weaning off of oxygen or breastfeeding for the first time), and parents 

#### cannot set these new goals until they let go of the old dream of a healthy full-term infant. 

#### It may take time to get over these feelings of loss. Many revisit these feelings frequently—sometimes for years—often 

#### around the time of their baby’s birth. Again, this is a normal reaction for many NICU families. As with anger, it often 

#### helps to discuss and acknowledge these feelings of loss. You may find it helpful to talk with other parents who have 

#### had a baby in the NICU. Your NICU team can help you identify possible support in your area. 

## Powerlessness 

#### You find yourself in a strange environment, surrounded by high-tech equipment and a multitude of people caring for 

#### your baby. You want to comfort your baby, but you may not know what to do. These feelings of powerlessness are 

#### common in the NICU. 

#### Begin by understanding that most NICU parents feel powerless, and acknowledge those feelings: “I feel like I can’t do 

#### anything for my baby.” If you are not yet comfortable with your baby’s nurses, you might begin by making 

#### observations and asking questions: “My baby looks uncomfortable. What can I do to help her?” or “My baby’s lips are 

#### dry. What can I use to moisten them?” As you become more comfortable with the NICU environment and have 

#### experience touching and interacting with your baby, feelings of confidence will begin to replace your initial feelings of 

#### powerlessness. 

#### Discuss your feelings with your baby’s nursing staff. They can often suggest unique ways for you to communicate 

#### with the NICU team and participate in your baby’s care. For example, providing breast milk for your baby is an 

#### important contribution to your baby’s care. Even if you had planned to formula feed later, you may want to consider 

#### breastfeeding now. Breast milk is especially important for sick or premature infants because it provides ideal 

#### nutrition and other benefits that help your baby heal and grow.

## Feeling “On Display” 

#### Unlike most hospital rooms for children and adults, several NICU babies and their parents may share space in the 

#### same large room. Many parents say that this exposure makes them feel like “fish in a tank” during their early 

#### experiences in the NICU. You may feel that others are watching your every move, and this loss of privacy can be 

#### stressful. The staff in the NICU are observing you to help you learn to care for your baby. They have special training 

#### with premature and ill infants and can observe the baby for signs of stress that you may not yet understand. In 

#### addition, other NICU parents may be watching you to identify you with your baby and to compare your circumstances 

#### to theirs. This socialization is part of the getting-to-know-you process in the NICU. The more familiar you become with 

#### the environment, the more comfortable you will be with the NICU staff, the routines, and your ability to care for your 

#### baby. Your care and presence are known by your baby and are vital to your baby’s growth and healing.
