# How to Care for Your Baby's Penis 

## The Circumcised Penis 

## If you chose to have your son circumcised (/English/ages

## stages/prenatal/decisions-to-make/Pages/Circumcision.aspx), the 

## procedure likley performed in the hospital before discharge, but is 

## sometimes done afterward. Ritual circumcisions for religious 

## reasons are usually performed in the second week after birth. 

## After the procedure, a light dressing with petroleum jelly will have 

## been placed over the head of the penis. The next time the baby 

## urinates, this dressing usually will come off. Some pediatricians 

## recommend keeping a clean dressing over the area until the penis 

## is fully healed, while others advise leaving it off. The important thing is to keep the area as clean. If stool get on the 

## penis, wipe it gently. 

## What to expect 

## The tip of the penis may look red for the first few days, and you may notice a yellow secretion. Both mean that the area 

## is healing normally. The redness and secretion disappear gradually within a week. 

## When to call the pediatrician 

## If the redness persists or there is swelling or crusted yellow sores, there may be an infection. This does not happen 

## often, but if you suspect an infection, consult your pediatrician. 

## After the circumcision has healed: 

## Usually, after the circumcision has healed, the penis requires no additional care. Occasionally a small piece of the 

## foreskin remains. You should pull back this skin gently each time the child is bathed. Examine the groove around the 

## head of the penis and make sure it's clean. 

## Note: If circumcision is desired but is not performed within the baby's first two weeks (perhaps for medical reasons), it 

## is usually put off for several weeks or months. The followup care is the same whenever it is done. Should 

## circumcision become necessary after the newborn period, general anesthesia is often used and requires a more 

## formal surgical procedure with control of bleeding and suturing of skin edges. 

## The Uncircumcised Penis 

## In the first few months, you should simply clean and bathe your baby's uncircumcised penis (/English/ages

## stages/baby/bathing-skin-care/Pages/Care-for-an-Uncircumcised-Penis.aspx), like the rest of the diaper area. Initially, 

## the foreskin is connected by tissue to the glans, or head, of the penis, so you shouldn't try to retract it. No cleansing of 

## the penis with cotton swabs or antiseptics is necessary. 

## The doctor will tell you when the foreskin has separated and can be retracted safely. This will not be for several 

## months or years, and should never be forced; if you force the foreskin to retract before it is ready, you could cause 

## painful bleeding and tears in the skin. After this separation occurs, retract the foreskin occasionally to gently cleanse 

## the end of the penis. 

## What to do as your son gets older: 

## As your son gets older, you'll need to teach him what he must do in order to urinate and wash his penis. Teach him to 

## clean his foreskin by: 

## Gently pulling it back away from the head of the penis. 

## Rinsing the head of the penis and inside fold of the foreskin.
