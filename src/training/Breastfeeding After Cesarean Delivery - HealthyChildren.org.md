# Breastfeeding After Cesarean Delivery 

## A common circumstance is a cesarean delivery, often referred to as a C-section, instead of a 

## vaginal birth. If the C-section is done without prior planning, you may have endured a long and 

## difficult delivery. If that’s the case, your doctor may be more worried about your rest and 

## recovery and less likely to encourage you to breastfeed right after delivery. You may also feel 

## disappointed by this unexpected turn of events, which may inhibit the letdown and flow of your 

## breast milk. Women who have planned C-sections, on the other hand, often know what to expect 

## and are fully prepared to breastfeed their newborn. 

## The good news is that the method of delivery has little effect on your ability to nurse your baby. 

## Your breast milk will come in almost as readily as it would have if you had delivered vaginally. It is especially 

## important to begin breastfeeding as soon as you are able and to continue breastfeeding your baby on a frequent basis 

## to ensure a good milk supply. Even if you need a few hours to recover from your surgery, you will be able to breastfeed 

## as soon as you feel up to it. 

## Use of Pain Medicines 

## Most drugs administered to mothers who give birth by cesarean delivery do not seriously affect the infant. You will 

## probably receive a regional anesthetic, such as an epidural, rather than the general anesthesia that once made women 

## unconscious during the delivery. Since less regional anesthesia gets into your bloodstream than with general 

## anesthesia, it causes less sedation in the newborn. Some newborns tend to be a bit sleepy following an epidural and 

## may suckle with less enthusiasm at first, but no longterm negative effects on full-term babies’ development or ability 

## to breastfeed have been demonstrated. Even if you are given general anesthesia, you should be able to breastfeed as 

## soon as you’re awake enough. When you are counseled about a cesarean delivery, it is a good idea to remind the 

## obstetrician and anesthesiologist that you intend to breastfeed. 

## Following a cesarean delivery, your doctor will give you pain medications, initially through your IV and later in pill 

## form, to help make you comfortable. In most cases, little of this medication passes through your breast milk to your 

## baby. Some pain medications may temporarily make your newborn a little sleepy, but the benefits of breastfeeding far 

## outweigh this potential drowsiness. Pain interferes with the release of oxytocin, a hormone which helps your milk to 

## flow readily for your baby, so adequate control of your pain is important. If you have any concerns about the pain 

## medication you are being offered, speak with your doctor or lactation specialist. 

## Getting Comfortable 

## Your abdominal incision may make finding a comfortable breastfeeding position a little more difficult at first. You 

## might adjust some of the basic positions by sitting up in bed, using one or two extra pillows to support your baby on 

## your lap and protect your incision, by lying down on your side with your baby facing you, or by using a football hold 

## with enough pillows to raise your baby’s head to the level of the breast. 

## Make sure to get into a comfortable position before beginning to breastfeed, and don’t be shy about asking for help. As 

## your incision heals and you are able to move about more readily, nursing will become much easier—but expect to 

## need some extra rest and assistance until you are fully back on your feet again. Be grateful for the help of family and 

## friends with household chores, so you can concentrate on recovery from surgery and breastfeeding your baby.
