# Treating Breast Pain 

## It’s not unusual for your baby to have a little trouble latching on 

## (https://healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Ensuring-Proper

## Latch-On.aspx) the first few times you breastfeed. Some babies suck on the nipple without taking 

## enough of the areola into the mouth, which can result in a lot of pain for you. Your nipples may 

## even become cracked and sore, and you may be tempted to stop breastfeeding. 

## In the days and weeks following childbirth, it is important to have your pediatrician or lactation 

## specialist check to make sure that correct latching on has been achieved, since improper latching on can seriously 

## decrease your baby’s milk intake as well as your milk production. It can also cause painful cracks in your nipples that 

## will make breastfeeding uncomfortable until they heal. 

## What you can do 

## Many women find that their nipples are somewhat sensitive for the first few days, until they become used to 

## breastfeeding. To prevent soreness, wash your breasts with warm water when bathing and avoid using soap, which can 

## dry and irritate your nipples. 

## If your nipples do become sore or even cracked, check again to be sure that your baby’s lips and gums are on the 

## areola as she nurses and not just on the nipple. If possible, vary her position at each feeding. Sometimes a simple 

## switch in positions can make all the difference. 

## Avoid exposing your nipples to excessive moisture between feedings, too. If you are wearing plastic breast shells to 

## treat inverted nipples, remove them after thirty minutes, since these devices hold in moisture. Refrain from using 

## plastic-lined nursing pads for the same reason. 

## Gently pat your nipples dry after a feeding and then apply colostrum, breast milk, or medical-grade purified lanolin to 

## soothe and heal them. (Creams and lotions generally will not help and may actually make the problem worse.) 

## If these steps fail to solve the problem, ask your doctor or lactation specialist for help. In most cases, nipple soreness is 

## a temporary issue and should not stand in the way of successful breastfeeding.
