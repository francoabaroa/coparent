# The Intermediate Care Experience 

## Some babies go home directly from the NICU, but most NICU babies are eventually transferred to 

## a step-down unit for less intensive care before discharge. The step-down unit may be within the 

## NICU itself or very nearby. Some NICUs transfer babies to a community hospital, possibly closer 

## to your home, for continued convalescence. 

## Knowing what to expect in the way of routines, staff members, and your role during this period of 

## hospitalization will help alleviate your stress and enable you to participate in your baby’s care 

## more fully. 

## Intermediate Care Defined 

## The name of the step-down unit and the babies who qualify for admission vary from hospital to hospital. The unit may 

## be called intermediate care, NICU step-down, special care, growing preemie unit, Level II unit, or something else. 

## Whatever the unit is called, your baby’s transfer means that she has matured beyond the need for intensive life 

## support. With a few rare exceptions, your baby is past the life-and-death crises and is on the road home. Parameters 

## for intermediate care vary widely among nurseries but, in general, your baby is off the ventilator and now needs less 

## intense nursing care and observation. 

## As your NICU nurse prepares you for your baby’s transition to this new phase of care, she may describe the 

## intermediate care nursery as a quieter place, more able to work with your baby’s sleep-wake cycles and abilities to 

## interact with her less hectic surroundings. 

## Because growing babies need a lot of undisturbed rest, feeding time is usually the best time for interaction; therefore, 

## your nurse may suggest that you begin to spend this time with your baby, learning about her emerging personality, 

## cues, and behaviors. Your baby no longer requires frequent intensive nursing care, so expect her nurse to have 3 to 4 

## other babies under her care. Some intermediate care settings keep the same nursing staff (your baby may even keep 

## the same primary nurse) for the entire hospitalization. Or the nurse in the intermediate care unit may supervise 

## specially trained nursing assistants who help with feeding, vital signs, and other care tasks. Occupational or physical 

## therapy personnel may be more visible in intermediate care as they work with you and your baby on feeding skills, 

## positioning, comforting, and other behavioral and physical tasks. In intermediate care, there is generally a greater 

## focus on parent involvement. 

## Learning to care for your baby becomes the focal point of your visits. When you call to check on your baby in 

## intermediate care, there will most likely be a different focus on what is reported. Unless some complication occurs, 

## your baby’s condition will change much less often than in the NICU. Lab work, x-rays, and other tests are less frequent 

## in intermediate care, and monitor alarms are heard less often. The staff focus on your baby’s progress and your plans 

## for actively participating in care and discharge planning. 

## Emotional Changes 

## In the NICU, you probably developed trusting relationships with members of the NICU staff—usually those staff who 

## always discussed your baby’s case openly and honestly and were willing to listen to your feelings and concerns. If 

## your move to the intermediate care nursery means a change of personnel, you’ll probably miss the comfortable 

## working relationships you shared. You and your baby will need some time to get acquainted with a new team and to 

## learn how to communicate well with that team. Eventually, you will develop good communication and trusting 

## relationships with staff members in the intermediate care nursery, just as you did with those in the NICU. 

## As things slow down, you may find that emotions from the past weeks are catching up with you. Your baby’s major 

## crises are over, but as you start to relax, you may also begin to feel the emotions that you’ve been too numb to 

## acknowledge until now. You may have been too frightened or overwhelmed to express some of those feelings, but now 

## they seem to come tumbling out at your partner, the nursery staff, and anyone else who is willing to listen. This 

## outpouring will slow down eventually.

### There are ways to gain control over these emotions. Think about what you are feeling. See your behavior as an 

### expression of overwhelming emotion. Talk to a friend, your partner, or a counselor. Write in a journal or talk into a 

### tape recorder. The length of time this process takes depends on the length of time your child was in the NICU, how 

### early in your pregnancy your infant was born, how many life-and-death crises your baby experienced in the NICU, 

### your support system, and your personal coping style. Ask your baby’s nurse if the hospital has a support group, social 

### worker, clinical nurse specialist, chaplain, or other person who supports the emotional needs of parents. Ask if they 

### have “graduate” NICU parents who volunteer to talk with families about their similar NICU experiences. Do not be 

### afraid to share your feelings with the doctor, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or bedside nurse caring for your 

### baby. Everyone is available to help. These emotions and feelings are normal. Keep in mind that what you have been 

### going through would be very stressful for any parent. Find coping skills that work for you. 

### By now you’ve observed and learned so much about NICU practices, your biggest challenge in adjusting to this new 

## unit will be accepting that different is not necessarily wrong. Adjusting to new faces and new routines will take time. 

### Your communication techniques may need review and fine-tuning as you negotiate a new plan of care for your baby. If 

### you’re not given an orientation list for the intermediate care unit, review your original NICU orientation list and ask 

### about the plan for the remainder of your baby’s hospital stay. This effort will communicate to staff that you’re 

### interested in how this new unit works. Most importantly, it will help you get comfortable so you can focus on learning 

### to care for your baby before she is discharged. In addition to learning about the new unit routines, communicate your 

### baby’s likes and dislikes, including her typical behavior patterns, with the staff. They will be most appreciative of the 

### information during this period of adjustment for both you and your baby.
