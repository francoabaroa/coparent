# Bedwetting: 3 Common Reasons & What Families Can Do 

## Did you know that there are about 5 million children in 

## the United States who wet the bed? If your child wets 

## the bed, they are not alone. 

## Although most children are toilet trained 

## (/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet

## training/Pages/default.aspx) between 2 and 4 years of 

## age, some children may not be able to stay dry at night 

## until they are older. Children develop at their own rate. 

## For example, studies have shown that 15% of 5and 7

## year-olds wet the bed. But by age 15, fewer than 1%wet 

## the bed. 

## Bedwetting is not a serious medical condition, but it can be a challenging problem for children and parents. Read on to 

## find out more about bedwetting and what families can do about it. 

## Reasons for bedwetting 

## Here are 3 common reasons for bedwetting: 

## 1. Communication between the brain and bladder. If the bladder signals the brain that it's filling up with urine— 

## and the brain doesn't send a message back to the bladder to relax and hold the urine until morning—bedwetting 

## will happen. Likewise, if the bladder signals the brain that it's filling up with urine and the brain doesn't hear the 

## signals, especially during deep sleep, bedwetting will happen. 

## 2. Stress or trauma. Sometimes when children experience stress (/English/health-issues/conditions/COVID

## 19/Pages/Signs-your-Teen-May-Need-More-Support.aspx) or traumatic events, or when they get sick or 

## constipated (/English/health-issues/conditions/abdominal/Pages/constipation.aspx), children who have 

## previously been dry at night can have bouts of bedwetting. This is a different problem than the child who has 

## never been dry at night. Children with these short-term episodes of bedwetting usually have dry nights when the 

## underlying problem resolves. 

## 3. Medical concerns. Rarely, some children begin to wet the bed as a result of a serious medical problem. 

## What you can do 

## Most children wet their beds during toilet training. Even after they stay dry at night for a number of days or even 

## weeks, they may start wetting at night again. If this happens to your child, simply go back to training pants at night and 

## try again another time. The problem usually disappears as children get older. If children reach school age and still 

## have problems wetting the bed, it most likely means they have never developed nighttime bladder control. 

## If you are concerned about your child's bedwetting or your child expresses concern, talk with your child's doctor. You 

## may be asked the following questions about your child's bedwetting: 

## Is there a family history of bedwetting? 

## How often and when does your child urinate during the day? 

## Have there been any changes in your child's home life such as a new sibling, a move, or other family issue? Does 

## your child drink a lot of water before bed? 

## Is there anything unusual about how your child urinates or the way the urine looks? 


## Signs of a medical problem 

### If your child has been completely toilet trained for 6 months or longer and suddenly begins wetting the bed, talk with 

### your child's doctor. It may be a sign of a medical problem. However, most medical problems that cause bedwetting to 

### recur suddenly have other signs, including: 

### Changes in how much and how often your child urinates during the day 

### Pain, burning, or straining while urinating 

### A very small or narrow stream of urine or dribbling 

### Cloudy or pink urine (/English/health-issues/conditions/genitourinary-tract/Pages/Blood-in-Urine

### Hematuria.aspx) or bloodstains on underpants 

### Daytime and nighttime wetting 

### Sudden change in personality or mood 

### Poor bowel control 

### Urinating after stress (coughing, running, or lifting) 

### Certain gait disturbances (problems with walking that may mean an underlying neurologic problem) 

### Continuous dampness 

### If your child has any of these signs, please contact your pediatrician. If necessary, they will refer you to a pediatric 

### urologist (/English/family-life/health-management/pediatric-specialists/Pages/What-is-a-Pediatric-Urologist.aspx), a 

### doctor who is specially trained to treat children's urinary problems. 

## Managing bedwetting 

### Keep the following tips in mind: 

### Do not blame your child. Remember that it is not your child's fault. Offer support, not punishment, for wet 

### nights. 

### Be honest with your child about what is going on. Let your child know it's not their fault and that most 

### children outgrow bedwetting. 

### Be sensitive to your child's feelings. If you don't make a big issue out of bedwetting, chances are your child 

### won't either. Also remind your child that other children wet the bed. 

### Protect the bed. A plastic cover under the sheets protects the mattress. 

### Let your child help. Encourage your child to help change the wet sheets and covers. This teaches responsibility. 

### It can also keep your child from feeling embarrassed if the rest of the family knows. However, if your child sees 

### this as punishment, it is not recommended. 

### Set a no-teasing rule in your family. Do not let family members, especially siblings, tease your child. Let them 

### know that it's not your child's fault. 

### Be aware of your child's urine and bowel habits. 

## Bedwetting alarms 

### If your child is still not able to stay dry during the night after using these stepsfor a few months, a bedwetting alarm 

### may be considered.When a bedwetting alarm senses urine, it sets off an alarmto awaken the child to use the childto 

### use the toilet. When used correctly, it will detect wetness right away and sound the alarm. 

### Bedwetting alarms are successful 50% to 75% of the time. They tend to be most helpful for children who are deep 

### sleepers and have some bladder control on their own. Ask your child's doctor which type of alarm may be best for 

### your child.

## Medicines 

### Medicines are available to treat bedwetting for children 6 years and older. Though medicines rarely cure bedwetting, 

### they may be helpful— especially when children begin attending sleepovers or overnight camps. Your child's doctor 

### can tell you more about these medicines and if they are right for your child. Remember to ask about possible side 

### effects. 

## Beware of "cures" 

### There are many treatment programs and devices that claim they can "cure" bedwetting. Be careful; many of these 

### products make false claims and promises and may be very expensive. Your child's doctor is the best source for advice 

### about bedwetting. Talk with your child's doctor before starting any treatment program. 

## Stay positive 

### Do not be discouraged if one treatment does not work. Some children will respond well to a combination of 

### treatments. If your child is one of a small number of children who do not respond to any treatment, talk with your 

### child's doctor about ways to manage bedwetting. 

### Also, in most cases, bedwetting decreases as the child's body matures. By the teen years, almost all children have 

### bladder control for dry nights. 

### All children benefit from emotional support from their family. Support from your child's doctor or other health 

### professionals can also help.
