# How to Share Books with Your 12 to 14 Month Old 

## Even babies can enjoy books and learn from sharing books with you. Sharing books with you little 

## ones can help teach them to talk and get ready to listen and learn in school. 

## Making Books A Part of Your Baby’s Bedtime Routine: 

## Set aside a 5 to 10 minutes with the TV off for sharing books as part of your regular bedtime 

## routine. Regular bedtime routines started with babies help prevent future bedtime struggles. 

## Teaching your baby how to fall asleep alone by putting him in bed awake helps prevent future 

## night wakings. 

## 12-14 Month Olds Can: 

## Choose a book to share. 

## Point to pictures they like in a book. 

## Imitate some animal sounds when they look at a picture of that animal. 

## Imitate your reactions to the book you are enjoying together. 

## Pay attention to a book for a few minutes at a time. 

## What Parents Can Do: 

## Find a quiet, comfortable place for book sharing. 

## Name the pictures your child is pointing to or looking at. 

## Help your child turn pages. 

## Ask your child questions she can answer by pointing, like: “ Where’s the doggie?” or “ Where’s the happy baby?” 

## or “ Who says meow?” 

## Imitate the sounds your child makes while looking at a picture. Then add a very short phrase, such as “‘ Moo’, the 

## cow says ‘moo’.”
