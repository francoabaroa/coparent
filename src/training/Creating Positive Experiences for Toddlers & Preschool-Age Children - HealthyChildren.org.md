# Creating Positive Experiences for Toddlers & Preschool

# Age Children 

## By: Robert Sege, MD, PhD, FAAP 

## Remember when your baby was born and looked at you 

## with those loving eyes? The joy of that first smile? That 

## love is still there in the toddler who is now running 

## around the house, getting into everything. 

## Being a toddler involves a lot of falling, giggling, and 

## crying. As toddlers grow and explore the world, parents 

## can create positive experiences for them that will last a 

## lifetime. 

## This sense of love and security helps build a strong 

## foundational relationship (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/Pages/Family-Relationships-Video.aspx). It also 

## helps fuel huge emotional growth that goes with your child's physical growth. 

## Everyday Ways to be Positive 

## Here are a few tips to help create peaceful, positive experiences for parents and their toddlers: 

## Read to your toddler. When you and your child snuggle as you open a book, many things happen. First, you and your 

## child will both enjoy the time and attention together. Your toddler will learn how to sit still, listen and communicate. 

## Reading (/English/ages-stages/preschool/Pages/How-to-Share-Books-with-Your-Preschooler.aspx) helps toddlers 

## learn new words. Picture books help toddlers make the connection between the sound of the word and its meaning. 

## Reading the same book over and over helps toddlers learn to anticipate what comes next—and experience the joy of 

## getting it right! The comfort of reading teaches language, gets them ready to learn to read, provides a calm balance to 

## toddler life. 

## Establish routines. Structure and routine give toddlers a feeling of security that fuels their natural curiosity and 

## exploration. Toddlers have new abilities and new experiences every day. Toddlers with routines for bath time 

## (/English/ages-stages/baby/bathing-skin-care/Pages/Bathing-Your-Newborn.aspx), bedtime, and meals seem to have 

## fewer power struggles with their parents and feel more comfortable exploring the world. When toddlers know what 

## comes next, they have an easier time changing to that part of their day. For example, a predictable bedtime ritual, 

## which might include a bath, brushing teeth, and reading before bed with their parent, helps toddlers wind down and 

## fall asleep. 

## Play with your toddler. One joy of being a parent is playing (/English/ages-stages/toddler/fitness/Pages/Caution

## Children-at-Play.aspx) like a kid again! So enjoy the time you spend together playing. Children learn from all the 

## different ways they play. When you go to the playground, they can experience their newfound physical abilities. 

## When they draw, color, or build with blocks, they develop hand and eye coordination. They also experience the joy of 

## creativity. As you do these things together, you will be creating positive experiences that both of you will remember. 

## Playing together makes it easier to deal with all the issues that arise as toddlers begin to assert their independence. 

## Engage toddlers in family tasks. When toddlers feel like they are a part of things, they tend to have fewer temper 

## tantrums (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/communication-discipline/Pages/Temper-Tantrums.aspx). On walks 

## in the neighborhood or at the supermarket, think about playing I spy: “I spy something red!" Talk with them, ask 

## questions, and help them learn from the experience. Toddlers who feel engaged easily learn about the world around 

## them. They also get the attention they crave without acting out. 

## Make connections. As children grow older, they get interested in playing with other children. Inviting another child 

## to play can give your toddler a way to learn social and emotional skills (/English/ages
