# How a Healthy Diet Helps You Breastfeed 

## For centuries, new mothers have been promised that certain foods or regimens will increase 

## their milk production, stimulate their babies’ development, or speed their own return to their 

## prepregnancy state. We now know that a normal, healthy diet is all it really takes for a 

## breastfeeding mother to maintain her milk supply and sustain both her baby’s and her own 

## health. Still, certain components of this normal diet are especially important when your body is 

## producing milk. 

## Calcium 

## Calcium is among the most important minerals in your diet. Your body stores of calcium (primarily from your bones) 

## supply much of the calcium in your breast milk to meet your baby’s calcium needs. Studies show that women lose 3 to 

## 5 percent of their bone mass when they are breastfeeding. After you finish breastfeeding, your body must replenish 

## the calcium that was used to produce your milk. Making sure you consume the recommended amount of calcium in a 

## normal diet—1,000 milligrams daily for all women ages eighteen to fifty and 1,300 milligrams for teenage mothers— 

## helps ensure that your bones will remain strong after you have weaned your baby. The good news is that you recover 

## the bone lost during breastfeeding within the six-month period after you wean your baby. 

## By consuming three servings of dairy products—8 ounces of milk is one serving—per day, you should receive the 

## calcium you need. If you dislike milk, you can get the calcium you need from cheese and yogurt. If you are allergic to 

## dairy products, try calcium-fortified juice, tofu, dark leafy greens such as spinach and kale, broccoli, or dried beans. 

## You can also get calcium in fortified foods such as breakfast cereal. (Contrary to popular myth, it is not necessary to 

## drink milk to make milk.) 

## If you do not routinely consume 1,000 milligrams of calcium in your diet, talk to your doctor or nutritionist about a 

## dietary supplement of calcium. (Avoid supplements made from crushed oyster shells, though, because of concern 

## about lead from these sources.) Consuming 1,000 milligrams of calcium daily—not only while breastfeeding but 

## throughout life until you reach menopause—will decrease your risk of osteoporosis in later life. 

## Vitamin D 

## Vitamin D—often known as the “sunshine vitamin”—is just as important as calcium when it comes to maintaining 

## bone strength. Vitamin D is essential for absorbing dietary calcium from your intestinal tract. The amount of vitamin 

## D you need depends on whom you ask. Most experts currently recommend getting at least 400 IU of vitamin D a day, 

## but some suggest getting as much as 1,000 IU. 

## Exposure to sunlight is one of the best ways to get your vitamin D, but it’s not the safest, given concerns about skin 

## cancer. It’s also unreliable and depends a great deal on where you live. Instead, you should look to get vitamin D from 

## foods such as salmon, mackerel, fortified milk or orange juice, and yogurt. Some ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are 

## fortified with vitamin D. You can get vitamin D from supplements, too. 

## Keep in mind, though, that your baby still needs vitamin D supplementation (/English/healthy

## living/nutrition/Pages/Vitamin-D-And-Your-Baby.aspx), even if you’re taking a supplement. Breast milk does not 

## provide babies with enough vitamin D. Exclusively breastfed infants or those getting less than 32 ounces of vitamin D

## fortified formula per day need 400 IU of vitamin D per day, because sunlight exposure can no longer be safely 

## recommended as their primary source of vitamin D. Babies exclusively breastfed may develop a condition called 

## rickets when adequate vitamin D is not provided. Make sure to talk to your baby’s doctor about the need for 

## supplementation. 

## Protein 

## Protein is another component of a healthy diet that demands your attention while you are breastfeeding. Protein 

## builds, repairs, and maintains body tissues. You need 6 to 6½ ounces a day when you’re nursing. You can get it best by 

## eating two or three servings of lean meat, poultry, or fish, usually about 3 ounces (the size of a deck of cards) in a 

## serving. You can also get 1-ounce equivalents of protein from 1 egg, 1 tablespoon of peanut butter, nuts (12 almonds or

#### 24 pistachios, for instance), or dried beans (¼ cup cooked). It’s also a good idea to include fish in your weekly diet as 

#### one source of protein, especially fatty fish such as salmon, tuna, and mackerel. These types of fish are rich sources of 

#### DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), an omega-3 fatty acid that is found in breast milk and contributes to growth and 

#### development of an infant’s brain and eyes. In addition, DHA content of milk declines with breastfeeding and can be 

#### replenished by eating fatty fish. As always, it’s best to vary your choices as much as possible, while keeping saturated 

#### fat intake to moderate levels. To do that, choose lean meats or low-fat varieties whenever possible. 

#### Since peanuts are one of the foods most likely to cause an allergic response in both children and adults, be sure to 

#### monitor your baby’s response when you eat foods containing peanuts, especially if there is a family history of food 

#### allergies (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Food-Allergies-in-Children.aspx). 

## Iron 

#### Iron helps breastfeeding mothers (and everyone else) maintain their energy level, so be sure to get enough of this 

#### important mineral in your diet. Lean meats and dark leafy green vegetables are good sources of iron. Other sources of 

#### iron include fish, ironfortified cereals, and the dark meat in poultry. 

#### When it comes to meeting your iron needs, it’s important to eat the best sources of iron and to pair them with the 

#### right foods. Iron from animal sources, for instance, is generally better absorbed than iron from plant sources. Tea may 

#### interfere with iron absorption, so you may want to avoid drinking tea when you eat iron-rich foods or take iron 

#### supplements. On the other hand, foods that are rich in vitamin C can enhance iron absorption. So consider pairing 

#### ground beef with spinach, or take your multivitamin/mineral supplement with a glass of orange juice. 

## Folic Acid 

#### Nursing mothers (along with all women of childbearing age) should get at least 400 micrograms of folate, or folic acid 

#### (/English/ages-stages/prenatal/Pages/Where-We-Stand-Folic-Acid.aspx), daily toprevent birth defects in future 

#### children and ensure their babies’ continued normal development. Spinach and other green vegetables are excellent 

#### sources of folic acid, as are citrus fruits or juices, many kinds of beans, and meat or poultry liver. You can also get folic 

#### acid from breads, cereal, and grains, which are enriched with folate in the United States. All women in their 

#### reproductive years are encouraged to take a multivitamin supplement that provides 400 micrograms of folate daily. 

## A Word on Supplements 

#### To make sure you are getting all of the important vitamins and minerals, you may want to continue taking your daily 

### prenatal vitamin or a daily multivitamin. Keep in mind, though, that these supplements are an addition to a healthy 

#### diet, not a replacement. The fact is, there is no replacement for a daily intake of fresh vitaminand mineral-rich foods.
