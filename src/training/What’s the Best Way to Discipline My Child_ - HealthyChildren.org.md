# What’s the Best Way to Discipline My Child? 

## As a parent, one of your jobs to teach your child to behave. It's a job 

## that takes time and patience. But, it helps to learn the effective and 

## healthy discipline strategies. 

## Here are some tips from the American Academy of Pediatrics 

## (AAP) on the best ways to help your child learn acceptable 

## behavior as they grow. 

## 10 healthy discipline strategies that 

## work 

## The AAP recommends positive discipline strategies that effectively 

## teach children to manage their behavior and keep them from harm while promoting healthy development. These 

## include: 

## 1. Show and tell. Teach children right from wrong with calm words and actions. Model behaviors you would like to 

## see in your children. 

## 2. Set limits. Have clear and consistent rules your children can follow. Be sure to explain these rules in age

## appropriate terms they can understand. 

## 3. Give consequences. Calmly and firmly explain the consequences if they don't behave. For example, tell her that 

## if she does not pick up her toys, you will put them away for the rest of the day. Be prepared to follow through right 

## away. Don't give in by giving them back after a few minutes. But remember, never take away something your 

## child truly needs, such as a meal. 

## 4. Hear them out. Listening is important. Let your child finish the story before helping solve the problem. Watch 

## for times when misbehavior has a pattern, like if your child is feeling jealous. Talk with your child about this 

## rather than just giving consequences. 

## 5. Give them your attention. The most powerful tool for effective discipline is attention—to reinforce good 

## behaviors and discourage others. Remember, all children want their parent's attention. 

## 6. Catch them being good. Children need to know when they do something bad--and when they do something 

## good. Notice good behavior and point it out, praising success and good tries. Be specific (for example, "Wow, you 

## did a good job putting that toy away!"). 

## 7. Know when not to respond. As long as your child isn't doing something dangerous and gets plenty of attention 

## for good behavior, ignoring bad behavior can be an effective way of stopping it. Ignoring bad behavior can also 

## teach children natural consequences of their actions. For example, if your child keeps dropping her cookies on 

## purpose, she will soon have no more cookies left to eat. If she throws and breaks her toy, she will not be able to 

## play with it. It will not be long before she learns not to drop her cookies and to play carefully with her toys. 

## 8. Be prepared for trouble. Plan ahead for situations when your child might have trouble behaving. Prepare them 

## for upcoming activities and how you want them to behave. 

## 9. Redirect bad behavior. Sometimes children misbehave because they are bored or don't know any better. Find 

## something else for your child to do. 

## 10. Call a time-out. A time-out (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/communication-discipline/Pages/Time-Outs

## 101.aspx) can be especially useful when a specific rule is broken. This discipline tool works best by warning 

## children they will get a time out if they don't stop, reminding them what they did wrong in as few words―and 

## with as little emotion―as possible, and removing them from the situation for a pre-set length of time (1 minute 

## per year of age is a good rule of thumb). With children who are at least 3 years old, you can try letting their 


#### children lead their own time-out instead of setting a timer. You can just say, "Go to time out and come back when 

#### you feel ready and in control." This strategy, which can help the child learn and practice self-management skills, 

##### also works well for older children and teens. 

## Learn from mistakes—including your own 

##### Remember that, as a parent, you can give yourself a time out if you feel out of control. Just make sure your child is in a 

##### safe place, and then give yourself a few minutes to take a few deep breaths, relax or call a friend. When you are feeling 

##### better, go back to your child, hug each other, and start over. 

##### If you do not handle a situation well the first time, try not to worry about it. Think about what you could have done 

##### differently and try to do it the next time. If you feel you have made a real mistake in the heat of the moment, wait to 

##### cool down, apologize to your child, and explain how you will handle the situation in the future. Be sure to keep your 

##### promise. This gives your child a good model of how to recover from mistakes. 

### Spanking and harsh words are harmful and don't work. Here's why: 

##### The AAP policy statement, " Effective Discipline to Raise Healthy Children (https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2018

##### 3112) ," highlights why it's important to focus on teaching good behavior rather than punishing bad behavior. 

##### Research shows that spanking, slapping and other forms of physical punishment don't work well to correct a 

##### child's behavior. The same holds true for yelling at or shaming a child. Beyond being ineffective, harsh physical 

##### and verbal punishments can also damage a child's long-term physical and mental health. 

##### Spanking's unhealthy cycle. The AAP advises that parents and caregivers should not spank or hit children. 

##### Instead of teaching responsibility and self-control, spanking often increases aggression and anger in 

##### children. A study (http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2013/10/16/peds.2013-1227) of 

##### children born in 20 large U.S. cities found that families who used physical punishment got caught in a 

##### negative cycle: the more children were spanked, the more they later misbehaved, which prompted more 

##### spankings in response. Spanking's effects may also be felt beyond the parent-child relationship. Because it 

##### teaches that causing someone pain is OK if you're frustrated—even with those you love. Children who are 

##### spanked may be more likely to hit others when they don't get what they want. 

##### Lasting marks. Physical punishment increases the risk of injury, especially in children under 18 months of 

##### age, and may leave other measurable marks on the brain and body. Children who are spanked show higher 

##### levels of hormones tied to toxic stress (https://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health

##### initiatives/resilience/Pages/ACEs-and-Toxic-Stress.aspx). Physical punishment may also affect brain 

##### development. One study found that young adults who were spanked repeatedly had less gray matter, the part 

##### of the brain involved with self-control, and performed lower on IQ tests as young adults than the control 

##### group. 

##### Verbal abuse: How words hurt. Yelling at children and using words to cause emotional pain or shame also 

##### has been found to be ineffective and harmful. Harsh verbal discipline, even by parents who are otherwise 

##### warm and loving, can lead to more misbehavior and mental health problems in children. Research 

##### (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3875601/) shows that harsh verbal discipline, which 

##### becomes more common as children get older, may lead to more behavior problems and symptoms of 

##### depression in teens.

## Healthy & effective discipline tips by age/stage 

Infants (^) Babies learn by watching what you do, so set examples of behavior you expect. 

#### Use positive language to guide your baby. For example, say, "Time to sit," rather than, "Don't 

#### stand." 

#### Save the word, "no," for the most important issues, like safety. Limit the need to say "no" by 

##### putting dangerous or tempting objects out of reach. 

##### Distracting and replacing a dangerous or forbidden object with one that is okay to play 

##### with is a good strategy at this age. 

##### All children, including babies, need consistent discipline, so talk with your partner, family 

##### members, and child care provider to set basic rules everyone follows. 

Toddlers (^) Your child is starting to recognize what's allowed and what isn't but may test some rules to 

##### see how you react. Pay attention to and praise behaviors you like and ignore those you 

##### want to discourage. Redirect to a different activity when needed. 

##### Tantrums can become more common as your child struggles to master new skills and 

##### situations. Anticipate tantrum triggers, like being tired or hungry, and help head them off 

##### with well-timed naps and meals. 

##### Teach your toddler not to hit, bite, or use other aggressive behaviors (/English/ages

##### stages/toddler/Pages/Aggressive-Behavior.aspx). Model nonviolent behavior by not 

##### spanking your toddler and by handling conflict with your partner in a constructive way. 

##### Stay consistent in enforcing limits. Try short time-outs (/English/family-life/family

##### dynamics/communication-discipline/Pages/Time-Outs-101.aspx) if needed. 

##### Acknowledge conflicts between siblings (/English/family-life/family

##### dynamics/Pages/Reducing-Sibling-Conflicts.aspx) but avoid taking sides. For example, if 

##### an argument arises about a toy, the toy can be put away. 

### Preschool 

### Age 

##### Preschool-age children are still trying to understand how and why things work and what 

##### effect their actions have. As they learn appropriate behavior, expect them to continue 

##### testing the limits of parents and siblings. 

##### Begin assigning age-appropriate chores (/English/family-life/family

##### dynamics/communication-discipline/Pages/Chores-and-Responsibility.aspx), like putting 

##### their toys away. Give simple, step-by-step directions. Reward them with praise. 

##### Allow your child to make choices among acceptable alternatives, redirecting and setting 

##### sensible limits. 

##### Teach your child to treat others as she wants to be treated. 

##### Explain that it's OK to feel mad sometimes, but not to hurt someone or break things. Teach 

##### them how to deal with angry feelings in positive ways, like talking about it. 

##### To resolve conflicts, use time-outs (/English/family-life/family

##### dynamics/communication-discipline/Pages/Time-Outs-101.aspx) or remove the source of 

##### conflict. 

### Gradeschool

### Age Children 

##### Your child is beginning to get a sense of right and wrong. Talk about the choices they have 

##### in difficult situations, what are the good and bad options, and what might come next 

##### depending on how they decide to act. 

##### Talk about family expectations and reasonable consequences for not following family 

##### rules. 

###### Back to Top 


##### Provide a balance of privileges and responsibility, giving children more privileges when 

##### they follow rules of good behavior. 

##### Continue to teach and model patience, concern and respect for others. 

##### Don't let yourself or others use physical punishment. If you live in an area where corporal 

##### punishment is allowed in schools, you have the right to say that your child may not be 

##### spanked. 

### Adolescents 

### & Teens 

##### As your teen develops more independent decision-making skills, you'll need to balance 

##### your unconditional love and support with clear expectations, rules, and boundaries. 

##### Continue to show plenty of affection and attention. Make time every day to talk. Young 

##### people are more likely to make healthy choices if they stay connected with family 

##### members. 

##### Get to know your teen's friends and talk about responsible and respectful relationships. 

##### Acknowledge your teen's efforts, achievements, and success in what they do―and don't 

##### do. Praise the choice to avoid using tobacco, e-cigarettes, alcohol, or other drugs. Set a 

##### good example through your own responsible use of alcohol and other substances.
