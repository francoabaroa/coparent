# 5 Play Tips for Preschool-Age Children 

## 1. Exercise imagination like a muscle 

## As with any skill, practice pays off. And having the right equipment helps. Make sure your kids have easy 

## access to open-ended toys and everyday objects that they can play with in a variety of ways. Screens 

## (/English/fmp/Pages/MediaPlan.aspx) and devices can be distracting while playing with your children, so 

## keep them out of reach. 

## 2. Make space for creativity 


### Have an area where kids can be creative, feel comfortable experiment and even get messy. Provide a 

### variety of different supplies. Crayons, markers, paints, paper, fabrics, glue, stickers, yarn, pipe cleaners 

### and old catalogs or magazines for collages are all good. For extra fun, place some random art supplies and 

### crafting materials in a box. Have kids close their eyes and pick out 3 to 5 items to assemble them into a 

### work of art. 

## 3. Praise the creative effort

### Children learn their self-worth and self-esteem (/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/Helping-Your

### Child-Develop-A-Healthy-Sense-of-Self-Esteem.aspx) through interactions with parents and caregivers, 

### among others. Be generous and positive in talking about your child's creative ideas. Focus on praising 

### their efforts rather than how well the work lives up to a certain standard. 

## 4. Think exploration & observation

### Activities like hide-and-seek or a scavenger hunt build observation and attention skills. Draw or take 

### photos of places where you'll hide some treats, toys or other items to find: behind a chair, under a blanket, 

### next to a tree. For older preschoolers, you may use sight words for clues. Try themed hunts, like a a 

### Halloween scavenger "haunt." Make it spooky by turning out the lights and using flashlights. 

## 5. Involve the senses 

### Fine-tuning gross motor skills involves the senses. Try activities that get kids using several senses at 

### once. Examples: balancing on one foot while tossing and catching a soft ball to the beat of a song they 

### sing! These kinds of activities can also help your child get the exercise they need to thrive. Preschool-age 

### children need at least 3 hours of physical activity (/English/healthy-living/fitness/Pages/Making-Fitness

### a-Way-of-Life.aspx) every day, or about 15 minutes every hour they are awake.
