# Hand Expressing Your Breast Milk 

## Some parents are nervous about the prospect of 

## learning to express their breast milk. Like any skill, 

## though, expressing milk gets easier each time you 

## practice it. 

## Milk can be expressed by hand, with a manual pump, or 

## with a battery-operated or electric breast pump. Hand

## expressing can be challenging for some parents to 

## learn, but it is the most convenient first choice. There is 

## no need for extra equipment (and, of course, it costs 

## nothing). 

## How to get started 

## You might want to try this first during a regular breastfeeding, after you have already experienced a let-down reflex: 

## You can express milk from the second breast immediately after a feeding with the first, or even during that first 

## feeding if your partner or someone else can help you. Some parents find that expressing milk when they wake up in 

## the morning is easiest, since their milk is more abundant then. 

## To express by hand, first be sure that your hands and fingernails (preferably short) are clean by washing them with 

## soap and water. (You might even take a warm shower just before expressing, or place a clean, warm, moist towel over 

## your breasts to help you relax and encourage the milk to let down.) Then massage your breast slowly, starting at the 

## outer areas and working your way down toward the nipple. The massage should be gentle, never uncomfortable to 

## your breasts or your skin. 

## Next, place a clean cup or jar beneath the nipple so that the milk will drip directly into it without touching your hands 

## or your breast. Position your hand on the areola with the thumb above and two fingers below, about an inch behind the 

## nipple. Press back toward your chest, then gently press the areola between your thumb and fingers and release with a 

## rhythmic motion until the milk flows or squirts out. Rotate your thumb and fingers around the areola to get milk from 

## several positions. Avoid squeezing the nipple or sliding down the breast, since this can cause bruising. 

## Storing expressed breast milk 

## Transfer the milk into clean, covered containers for storage (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Storing

## and-Preparing-Expressed-Breast-Milk.aspx) in the refrigerator or freezer. If you don't collect any milk this time, try 

## again later—but be aware that your let-down reflex may take a while to occur, and it may then take up to half an hour 

## at first to sufficiently relieve both breasts. With practice, you will probably be able to shorten this time considerably 

## and the amount of milk you collect will increase from perhaps 1 ounce per session to a full bottle or more.
