# Tips for Grandparents of a 1-Year-Old 

## You have an ongoing role to play in your grandchild's nurturing and development. Though you 

## must carefully "re-childproof" your house as a grandparent 

## (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/A-Message-for

## Grandparents-Keeping-Your-Grandchild-Safe-in-Your-Home.aspx), there are many wonderful 

## things your grandchildren can do with grandparents. 

## Here are some activities in which you can participate and 

## some things to keep in mind as you do: 

## Motor Skills 

## Help your grandchild practice skills that tie in with your own likes and preferences. For example: 

## Involve him in physical activities (e.g. sweeping, preparing food, or arranging items) around the house in which 

## you can lend a helping hand to ensure his success and safety. 

## Devise and initiate outdoor games and exercises that you and he can enjoy together. 

## Cognitive Milestones 

## To help your grandchild develop cognitively: 

## Read special books (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Developmental

## Milestones-of-Early-Literacy.aspx) to him. 

## Play music and sing songs with him. 

## Assist him as he begins to learn his numbers. 

## Play hiding games like hide-and-seek and peekaboo. 

## Mix fantasy play with real play. 

## Social Development 

## Encourage your grandchild to interact with his peers, but keep in mind that egocentric behavior is normal for 

## this age. 

## Don't overreact to selfishness or disregarding the feelings of others. Just reinforce that he should be sensitive to 

## the feelings of other children. 

## Do not give her a motorized riding toy (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/What

## to-Look-for-in-a-Toy.aspx). 

## Do not give her a toy with any small parts or sharp edges. Stick with toys that are intended for toddlers, not for 

## older children. 

## Water Safety 

## Never leave your toddler, even for a few seconds, in or near any body of water without supervision. This includes 

## a bathtub (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/Bathroom-Safety.aspx), 

## toilet, wading pool, swimming pool (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/at

## play/Pages/Swimming-Pool-Safety.aspx), fishpond, whirlpool, hot tub, lake, or ocean. 

## Auto Safety 

## The safest place for all children to ride is in their car seat (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety

## prevention/on-the-go/Pages/Car-Safety-Seats-Information-for-Families.aspx) in the backseat. 

## Never let your toddler climb out of his car seat while the car is moving.

#### Keep in mind that this period of self-centeredness will taper off by the age of three. 

#### Nurture his self-esteem (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/Helping-Your

#### Child-Develop-A-Healthy-Sense-of-Self-Esteem.aspx) at every opportunity, but not at the expense of others. 

### Emotional Development 

#### Repeatedly tell your grandchild how special he is to you. Tell him how important your time together is to you. 

#### Don't overreact to the mood swings he goes through—clinging one moment, independent the next, and defiant 

#### after that. 

#### Don't reinforce his aggressiveness (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/family-life/family

#### dynamics/communication-discipline/Pages/Aggressive-Behavior.aspx) if it becomes abusive. Set limits, but do 

#### not physically restrain or punish him. Follow your own inclinations about the activities or areas that can promote 

#### his development.
