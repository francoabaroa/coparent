# How to Nurse on an Airplane 

## Nursing an infant on an airplane (/English/safety-prevention/on-the-go/Pages/Family-Friendly

## Flying.aspx) presents its own unique set of challenges. Especially if your baby’s car seat is in the 

## window seat, you are in the middle seat, and a complete stranger is on the aisle encroaching on 

## your shared armrest (which, as you know, is not just hypothetical), breastfeeding (/english/ages

## stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/default.aspx) comfortably may seem like an oxymoron. Here 

## are a few suggestions that can really help. 

## One-sided 

## If the flight is short or you find yourself uncomfortably close to your seatmate, nursing on just one side while saving 

## the other for when you get off the plane may be an acceptable option. 

## At an Angle 

## Close quarters can greatly limit a breastfeeding mother’s chance of privacy. Simply angling your body so that you’re 

## facing the window before trying to breastfeed can help minimize your degree of exposure. 

## Covering Up 

## For the sake of modesty or convenience, bear in mind how much you want to bare, and wear a shirt you are 

## particularly comfortable breastfeeding in, such as a loose-fitting top layer, a button-down blouse, or custom-designed 

## breastfeeding attire. 

## Layering 

## Use your jacket, a blanket, a magazine, or even your baby carrier (/English/safety-prevention/on-the-go/Pages/Infant

## Carriers.aspx)or sling as a practical way of preventing your fellow passengers from having a bird’s-eye view. 

## Stalling 

## Nursing in the lavatory may seem like a reasonable last resort, but it generally poses a huge inconvenience for fellow 

## passengers and isn’t exactly hygienic. In other words, we don’t recommend it.
