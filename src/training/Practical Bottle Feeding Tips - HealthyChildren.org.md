# Practical Bottle Feeding Tips 

## Bottle feeding (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/pages/Bottle-Feeding.aspx) can 

## be a warm, loving experience—cuddle your baby closely, gaze into her eyes, and coo and talk 

## to her. Never prop the bottle and let your baby feed alone; not only will you miss the 

## opportunity to bond with her while she feeds, but there’s also a danger that she’ll choke or 

## the bottle will slip out of position. Propping the bottle also increases the risk of ear 

## infections. We do not recommend devices to hold a bottle in a baby’s mouth—they could be 

## dangerous. 

## Although some babies will drink a bottle straight from the refrigerator, most prefer milk 

## warmed to room temperature. You can warm a bottle (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding

## nutrition/Pages/Preparing-Sterilizing-and-Storing-Formula.aspx) by placing it in a bowl of hot water for a few 

## minutes. Sprinkle a few drops on your wrist; it should feel lukewarm. If it’s too warm, wait for it to cool a bit and 

## test again. 

## Note: Never warm a bottle of formula or human milk in the microwave. The bottle itself may feel cool while 

## the liquid inside can be too hot. Microwaving also heats unevenly. Even though a few drops sprinkled on 

## your wrist may feel OK, some of the formula or human milk may be scalding. The composition of human 

## milk may change if it is warmed too much, as well. 

## Make sure the nipple hole is the right size. If your baby seems to be gagging or gulping too fast, the nipple hole 

## may be too large. If your baby is sucking hard and seems frustrated, the hole may be too small. 

## Try different nipple shapes to see which your baby prefers. There is no correct shape. 

## Angle the bottle so your baby isn’t sucking in air. Burp your baby (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding

## nutrition/Pages/Burping-Hiccups-and-Spitting-Up.aspx) a couple of times during the course of a feeding. 

## Encourage your partner to give your baby a bottle now and then, perhaps one of the late-night feedings. This not 

## only allows you some extra rest, but it also fosters bonding with your baby. 

## Don’t let your baby fall asleep sucking on a bottle of milk, especially if she is beginning to cut teeth 

## (/English/ages-stages/baby/teething-tooth-care/Pages/default.aspx). Milk pooled in your baby’s mouth can 

## cause serious tooth decay (/English/ages-stages/baby/teething-tooth-care/pages/Preventing-Tooth-Decay.aspx), 

## known as nursing-bottle caries. After feeding and before putting your baby to sleep, gently wipe any milk residue 

## from her gums. If she needs to suck herself to sleep, give her a pacifier (/English/ages-stages/baby/crying

## colic/Pages/Practical-Pacifier-Principles.aspx) instead of a bottle. 

## Repeated sterilization (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Preparing-Sterilizing-and-Storing

## Formula.aspx) may distort nipple openings. Test to make sure milk flow through the nipple is adequate.
