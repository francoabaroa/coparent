# Physical Appearance and Growth: Your 1 Year Old 

## By the end of her first year, your baby’s growth rate will begin to slow. From now until her next 

## growth spurt (which occurs during early adolescence), her height and weight should increase 

## steadily, but not as rapidly as during those first months of life. As an infant, she may have gained 4 

## pounds (1.8 kg) in four months or less, but during the entire second year, 3 to 5 pounds (1.4–2.3 kg) 

## probably will be her total weight gain. Continue to plot her measurements every few months on 

## growth charts to make sure she’s generally following the normal growth curve. As you’ll see, 

## there’s now a much broader range of what’s “normal” than there was at earlier ages. 

## At fifteen months, the average girl weighs about 23 pounds (10.5 kg) and is almost 30.5 inches (77 

## cm) tall; the average boy weighs about 24.5 pounds (11 kg) and is 31 inches (78 cm) tall. Over the next three months, 

## they’ll each gain approximately 1 1⁄2 pounds (0.7 kg) and grow about an inch (2.5 cm). By two, she’ll be about 34 inches 

## (about 86 cm) tall and weigh 27 pounds (12.2 kg); he’ll reach 34 1⁄2 inches (87.5 cm) and almost 28 pounds (12.6 kg). 

## Your baby’s head growth also will slow dramatically during the second year. Although she’ll probably gain only about 

## 1 inch (2.5 cm) in head circumference this entire year, by age two she’ll have attained about 90 percent of her adult 

## head size. 

## Your toddler’s looks, however, probably will change more than her size. At twelve months, she still looked like a baby, 

## even though she may have been walking and saying a few words. Her head and abdomen were still the largest parts of 

## her body, her belly stuck out when she was upright, and her buttocks, by comparison, seemed small—at least when her 

## diaper was off. Her arms and legs were still relatively short and soft, rather than muscular, and her face had softly 

## rounded contours. 

## All this will change as she becomes more active, developing her muscles and trimming away some of her baby fat. Her 

## arms and legs will lengthen gradually, and her feet will start to point forward as she walks, instead of out to the sides. 

## Her face will become more angular and her jawline better defined. By her second birthday, it will be hard to remember 

## how she looked as an infant.
