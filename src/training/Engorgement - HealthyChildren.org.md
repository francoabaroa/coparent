# Engorgement 

## Your breasts may ache at times when they become 

## uncomfortably full or engorged. Most mothers have 

## experienced such fullness in their breasts at one time 

## or another as their bodies readjust to a baby’s changing 

## demands for breast milk. A little fullness during the 

## first few days after birth is normal, but excessive 

## engorgement, which can occur from missed feedings or 

## a change in how often your baby nurses, can be quite 

## painful. 

## Feeding frequently on demand helps prevent 

## engorgement, but if your baby is nursing as often as she 

## wants and is gaining weight, you may have to take extra 

## measures to relieve the pressure on your breasts. You can, for example, soak a cloth in warm water and put it on your 

## breasts or take a warm shower before feeding your baby. It may also help to express a small amount of milk before 

## breastfeeding, either manually or with a breast pump. For severe engorgement, use a cool compress, gel pack, or ice 

## pack between feedings to relieve discomfort and reduce swelling. 

## Discomfort due to engorgement may also be relieved by feeding your baby in more than one position (/English/ages

## stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Positioning-Your-Baby-For-Breastfeeding.aspx). Try alternating sitting up, lying 

## down, and using the football hold. Gently massage your breasts from under the arm and down toward the nipple to 

## help reduce soreness and promote milk flow. If you have a forceful milk ejection that causes your baby to choke, try 

## feeding her by lying down on your back with her lying on top of you. Take a break in the middle of a session to express 

## a bit more if your baby starts to choke. While you do not want to take any medications without approval from your 

## doctor, acetaminophen or ibuprofen may relieve pain and are safe to take occasionally during breastfeeding. 

## Meanwhile, the best solution for engorgement is to keep breastfeeding. Soon your milk supply will better match your 

## breastfeeding child’s demand, and you will feel much more comfortable. 

## As strange as it might sound, one treatment for engorgement that many breastfeeding women have found effective 

## involves cabbage. Clean, refrigerated cabbage leaves can be either torn into smaller pieces or left whole and applied 

## directly to the breast. Whole leaves will conform to the shape of the breast if the large central stem portion is 

## removed first. Held in place by the bra, the cabbage is left against the breast as desired or until it becomes warm and 

## wilts. The wilted leaves can be replaced by fresh, cool ones. Either green or red cabbage can be used, but red cabbage is 

## more likely to stain a bra or clothing. Many mothers experience an improvement in the pain and swelling of 

## engorgement within hours after using the cabbage. There is limited clinical research on the use of cabbage for 

## engorgement, and the exact way in which cabbage decreases breast swelling is unknown, but the treatment appears to 

## be harmless. For engorgement, cabbage should be used only until the swelling and pain begin to subside. Continued 

## use may decrease the milk supply too much. Some mothers regularly apply cabbage to hasten the resolution of 

## swelling or discomfort that occurs with weaning, especially when weaning occurs over a relatively brief time.
