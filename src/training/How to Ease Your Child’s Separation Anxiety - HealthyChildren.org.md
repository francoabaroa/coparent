# How to Ease Your Child’s Separation Anxiety 

## By: Wendy Sue Swanson, MD, MBE, FAAP 

## Separation anxiety varies WIDELY between children. 

## Some babies become hysterical when mom is out of 

## sight for a very short time, while other children seem to 

## demonstrate ongoing anxiety at separations during 

## infancy, toddlerhood, and preschool. 

## To all you working parents 

## The trick for surviving separation anxiety demands 

## preparation (/English/family-life/work

## play/Pages/Preparing-Your-Child-for-Child-Care.aspx), 

## brisk transitions, and the evolution of time. I would suggest we parents suffer as much as our children do when we 

## leave (/English/family-life/work-play/Pages/Making-Drop-Off-at-Childcare-Easier.aspx). Even though we are often 

## reminded that our children stop crying within minutes of our leave-taking, how many of you have felt like you’re 

## "doing it all wrong" when your child clings to your legs, sobs for you to stay, and mourns the parting? 

## As a working parent (/English/family-life/work-play/Pages/Working-Mothers.aspx), separation anxiety creates 

## questions for me. Although it is an entirely normal behavior and a beautiful sign of a meaningful attachment, 

## separation anxiety can be exquisitely unsettling for us all. 

## Here are facts about separation anxiety and tips to improve the transitions I’ve learned the hard way (I’ve made about 

## every mistake): 

## Facts about separation anxiety 

## Infants: Separation anxiety develops after a child gains an understanding of object permanence. Once your 

## infant realizes you’re really gone (when you are), it may leave them unsettled. Although some babies display 

## object permanence and separation anxiety as early as 4 to 5 months of age, most develop more robust separation 

## anxiety at around 9 months. The leavetaking can be worse if your infant is hungry, tired, or not feeling well. 

## Keep transitions short and routine if it’s a tough day. 

## Toddlers: Many toddlers skip separation anxiety in infancy and start demonstrating challenges at 15 or 18 

## months of age. Separations are more difficult when children are hungry, tired, or sick—which is most of 

## toddlerhood! As children develop independence during toddlerhood, they may become even more aware of 

## separations. Their behaviors at separations will be loud, tearful, and difficult to stop. 

## Preschoolers: By the time children are 3 years of age, most clearly understand the effect their anxiety or pleas at 

## separation have on us. It doesn’t mean they aren’t stressed, but they certainly are vying for a change. Be 

## consistent; don’t return to the room based on a child’s plea, and certainly don’t cancel plans based on separation 

## anxiety. Your ongoing consistency, explanations, and diligence to return when you say you will are key. 

## How to survive separation anxiety 

## Create quick good-bye rituals. Even if you have to do major-leaguebaseball–style hand movements, give triple 

## kisses at the cubby, or provide a special blanket or toy as you leave, keep the good-bye short and sweet. If you 

## linger, the transition time does too. So will the anxiety. 

## Be consistent. Try to do the same drop-off with the same ritual at the same time each day you separate to avoid 

## unexpected factors whenever you can. A routine can diminish the heartache and will allow your child to 

## simultaneously build trust in her independence and in you.

#### Attention: When separating, give your child full attention, be loving, and provide affection. Then say good-bye 

#### quickly despite their antics or cries for you to stay. 

#### Keep your promise. You’ll build trust and independence as your child becomes confident in her ability to be 

#### without you when you stick to your promise of return. The biggest mistake I ever made in this regard was 

#### returning to class to "visit" my son about an hour after a terrible transition. I was missing him, and although the 

#### return was well intended, I not only extended the separation anxiety, we started all over again in the process. 

#### When I left the second time (and subsequent days) it was near nuclear. 

#### Be specific, child style. When you discuss your return, provide specifics that your child understands. If you 

### know you’ll be back by 3:00 pm, tell it to your child on their terms; for example, say, "I’ll be back after nap time 

### and before afternoon snack." Define time they can understand. Talk about your return from a business trip in 

### terms of " sleeps." Instead of saying, " I’ll be home in 3 days," say, " I’ll be home after 3 sleeps." 

#### Practice being apart. Ship the children off to grandma’s (/English/family-life/work-play/Pages/A-Message-for

#### Grandparents-Who-Provide-Childcare.aspx) home, schedule playdates, allow friends and family to provide child 

#### care for you (even for an hour) on the weekend. Before starting child care or preschool, practice going to school 

#### and your good-bye ritual before you even have to part ways. Give your child a chance to prepare, experience, and 

#### thrive in your absence! 

#### It’s rare that separation anxiety persists on a daily basis after the preschool years. If you’re concerned that your child 

#### isn’t adapting to being without you, chat with the pediatrician. Your pediatrician has certainly helped support families 

#### in the same situation and can help calm your unease and determine a plan to support both of you!
