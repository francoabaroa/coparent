## healthy playtime by taking your child to a park to play

## group. Aggressive behavior between children is

## number of steps you can take to keep aggressive 

## behavior to a minimum. 

## Playing with others is important 

## child's work! 

## Support play by making your home a good place to play. 

## Teach the skills needed to play well with others. 

## Learning to play well with others is not a one-time lesson. It takes time and practice. 

## Important life skills are learned when children play. These skills will help them make and keep friends. 

## When young children play with children close to their own age, they 

## learn: 

## How to cooperate 

## When to lead and when to follow 

## How to solve problems 

## Create play opportunities 

## Invite other children to your home or to play in the neighborhood park. 

## The first visit needs to be short (about 1 hour) and is best with only one other child. 

## Plan to end before everyone gets too tired. 

## Know how to contact the other child's parent. 

## Go to another child's home. 

## For the first visit, you may want to stay until you know your child is comfortable being there without you. 

## Get to know the other child's parents. You might be able to help each other out! 

## Join an organized play group. 

## When playing without parents, children do best with a small number of children. 


### Find out with whom your child likes to play. 

#### For children in child care, preschool, and play groups, invite a friend to your house or to the park. 

## Make your home a great place to play 

#### Plan ahead. Avoid things like superhero dress-up clothes and toy guns that encourage aggressive play. 

#### Find out what your visitor enjoys. Ask your child what activities the friend enjoys. Playtime will be more fun, 

#### and this teaches your child to be thoughtful. 

#### Have enough items for everyone. If there aren't enough, suggest another activity. 

#### Your child's "favorite thing" does not need to be shared. Let your child put away a few things that are off limits. 

#### Make your home a safe place. Poisons need to be locked away. Homes without guns are the safest. But if there 

#### are guns, they need to be stored locked and unloaded; bullets need to be stored in another locked place. 

#### Do not overplan. Just set the stage with materials and ideas. Let the children use their creativity and 

#### imaginations! 

#### Help the children with some activities, like cutting out shapes for arts and crafts, and keep an eye on them at all times. 

#### For the most part, it is better if you only get involved when they need your help. Give them a chance to resolve 

#### differences on their own. 

## Teach your child to be a good playmate 

#### Before, during, and after your child plays with other children, talk about how to get along with others. 

### Set a few simple and very specific rules. 

#### "People are not for hitting." 

#### "We do not grab toys from other children." 

### Help your child express likes, dislikes, and desires with words. Review what to say. 

#### "I like to paint on the easel." 

#### "I do not like to..." 

#### "I want to be a firefighter." 

### Show your child how to solve problems. Explain why something is not possible 

### and offer other choices. 

#### "Tell Julie you don't like to be pushed on the swing. Maybe you would both like to ride on the seesaw instead." 

### Notice and praise the children for things that went well. 

#### "I really liked the way you remembered to take turns with the watering can." 

#### "It was great to hear you using your polite words!" 

## Aggressive behavior is normal 

#### Since it is hard for young children to understand someone else's point of view, there will be some arguments. Young 

#### children react to the moment and may do things without thinking. 

#### Aggressive behavior is often not meant to be hostile or to hurt others. In fact, young children frequently get upset 

#### when another child gets hurt while playing. 

#### When something happens that is upsetting, talk with everyone. Help each child try to see the other child's point of 

#### view. This way, children will learn how to avoid and deal with arguments.

#### Behavior.aspx), talk to your pediatrician. 

## Tips on reducing aggressive behavior 

### Provide the right amount of space. 

#### A small number of children in a very large space, or a large number of children in a small space, tends to increase 

#### aggressive play. Have the right amount of space to avoid conflicts. 

### Plan how to respond in a positive way. 

#### It's easier to guide children to good behavior instead of telling them what not to do. "I will be right here; come and 

#### tell me if you need my help." 

### Redirect behaviors like pushing, hitting, or taking someone else's toys to a more 

### positive activity. 

#### Often, this means it's time for a new activity. "We don't grab toys; we share toys. It looks like you're done with that 

#### truck for now. Here are some paper and markers for you." 

### Teach children to use words to express feelings, desires, and needs. 

#### A child's first reaction is usually "physical," so this may be difficult to learn. With words, children learn how to 

#### solve their own problems. Teach your child to say something like, "I don't like that. Grabbing my toy makes me 

#### mad. Please give it back." 

### Assume a child does something for a good reason, even if the action is not nice. 

#### What looks aggressive, like grabbing toys from others, may be a child's attempt to join in with others. Teach 

#### children to take turns rather than get mad at them for grabbing toys. 

### Pay attention to basic comfort and needs. 

#### Conflicts are more likely to happen when children are too hot, too cold, hungry, or tired!
