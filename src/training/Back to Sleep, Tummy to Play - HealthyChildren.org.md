# Back to Sleep, Tummy to Play 

## What are two of the most important things to 

## remember about safe sleep practices (/English/ages

## stages/baby/sleep/Pages/A-Parents-Guide-to-Safe

## Sleep.aspx) for your baby? 

## Healthy babies are safest when sleeping on 

## their backs (/English/ages

## stages/baby/sleep/Pages/Sleep-Position-Why

## Back-is-Best.aspx) at nighttime and during naps. 

## Side sleeping is not as safe as back sleeping and is 

## not advised. 

## Tummy time is for babies who are awake and 

## being watched. Your baby needs this to develop strong muscles. 

## Remember...back to sleep, tummy to play! 

## How much tummy time should a baby have? 

## Beginning on their first day home from the hospital or in your family child care home or center, play and interact with 

## the baby while they are awake and on the tummy two to three times each day for a short period of time (3-5 minutes). 

## Increase the amount of time as your baby shows they enjoys the activity. A great time to do this is following a diaper 

## change or when the baby wakes up from a nap. 

## Tummy time prepares babies for the time when they will be able to slide on their bellies and crawl (/English/ages

## stages/baby/Pages/Crawling-Styles.aspx). As babies grow older and stronger they will need more time on their 

## tummies to build their own strength. 

## What if my baby does not like being on their tummy? 

## Some babies may not like the tummy time position at first. Place yourself or a toy in reach for them to play with. 

## Eventually your baby will enjoy tummy time and begin to enjoy play (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/The

## Importance-of-Tummy-Time.aspx) in this position. 

## Doesn't sleeping on their back cause the baby to have a flat head? 

## Parents and caregivers often worry about the baby developing a flat spot on the back of the head (/English/health

## issues/conditions/Cleft-Craniofacial/Pages/Positional-Skull-Deformities-and-Torticollis.aspx) because of sleeping on 

## the back. Though it is possible for a baby to develop a flat spot on the head, it usually rounds out as they grow older and 

## sit up. 

## There are ways to reduce the risk of the baby developing a flat spot: 

## Alternate which end of the crib you place the baby's feet. This will cause them to naturally turn toward light or 

## objects in different positions, which will lessen the pressure on one particular spot on her head. 

## When your baby is awake, vary their position. Limit time spent in freestanding swings, bouncy chairs and car 

## seats. These items all put added pressure on the back of the baby's head. 

## Spend time holding the baby in your arms as well as watching them play on the floor, both on their tummy 

## and on her back. 

## A breastfed baby would normally change breasts during feeding ; if the baby is bottle fed, switch the side that 

## they feed on during feeding. 


## How can I exercise the baby while they are on their tummy? 

#### There are lots of ways to play with the baby while they are on their tummy (/English/ages

#### stages/baby/sleep/Pages/The-Importance-of-Tummy-Time.aspx). 

#### Place yourself or a toy just out of the baby's reach during playtime to get them to reach for you or the toy. 

#### Place toys in a circle around the baby. Reaching to different points in the circle will allow them to develop the 

#### appropriate muscles to roll over, scoot on their belly and crawl. 

#### Lie on your back and place the baby on your chest. The baby will lift their head and use their arms to try to see 

#### your face. 

#### While keeping watch, have a young child play with the baby while on their tummy. Young children can get 

#### down on the floor easily. They generally have energy for playing with babies, may really enjoy their role as the 

#### "big kid" and are likely to have fun themselves. 

## How to create a safe sleep environment 

#### Follow these easy steps to create a safe sleep environment (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/a-parents-guide

### to-safe-sleep.aspx) in your home, family child care home or child care center ( see Keep Your Sleeping Baby Safe 

### (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/A-Parents-Guide-to-Safe-Sleep.aspx) for more information): 

#### Always place babies on their backs to sleep , even for short naps. 

#### Place babies on a firm, flat sleep surface that meets current safety standards. For more information about 

#### crib safety standards, visit the Consumer Product Safety Commission Web site (https://www.cpsc.gov/). 

#### Remove any soft objects, loose bedding or any objects that could increase the risk of entrapment, suffocation, 

#### or strangulation from the baby's sleep area. Make sure the baby's head and face remain uncovered during sleep. 

#### Place the baby in a smoke-free environment , away from areas where people use tobacco products. 

#### Do not let babies get too hot. Keep the room where babies sleep at a comfortable temperature. In general, dress 

#### babies in no more than one extra layer than you would wear. Babies may be too hot if they are sweating or if their 

#### chests feel hot. If you are worried that babies are cold, use a wearable blanket such as a sleeping sack or warm 

#### sleeper that is the right size for each baby. These are made to cover the body and not the head. 

#### If you are working in a family child care home or center, create a written safe sleep policy to ensure that 

#### staff and families understand and practice back to sleep and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and 

#### suffocation risk reduction practices in child care. If you are a parent with a child in out-of-home child care, 

#### advocate for the creation of a safe sleep policy.
