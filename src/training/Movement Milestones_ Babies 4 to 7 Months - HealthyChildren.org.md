# Movement Milestones: Babies 4 to 7 Months 

## Once your baby reaches about four to seven months 

## old, get ready for some exciting movement milestones. 

## Some of the big challenges they're working on at this 

## age include rolling over both ways, for example, and 

## sitting up! 

## Your baby will begin to master skills like these their 

## back and neck muscles gradually get stronger. They're 

## also developing better balance in their trunk, head, and 

## neck. 

## First, they'll raise their head and hold it up while lying 

## on their stomach. Encourage this by placing them on 

## their stomach and extending their arms forward while they are awake. Then, get their attention with an attractive toy. 

## Use it to coax them to hold their head up and look at you. This also is a good way to check their hearing and vision. 

## Getting ready to roll over 

## Once they're able to lift their head, your baby will start pushing up on their arms and arching their back to lift their 

## chest. This strengthens their upper body. This is key to keeping steady and upright when sitting. At the same time, 

## your baby may rock on their stomach, kick their legs, and “swim" with their arms. These skills, which usually appear at 

## about five months, are needed for rolling over and crawling. By the end of this period, they'll probably be able to roll 

## over in both directions. However, the time frame varies for different babies. Most children roll from stomach to back 

## before the opposite direction, although doing it in reverse is perfectly normal. 

## Working on sitting up 

## Once your baby can raise their chest, help them practice sitting up. Hold them up or support their back with pillows as 

## they learn to balance themselves. They'll soon learn to “tripod," which is leaning forward as they extends their arms to 

## balance. Interesting toys in front of them will give them a focus as they gains their balance. It will be some time before 

## they can get themselves to a sitting position without your help. But by six to eight months, if you position them 

## upright, they'll stay sitting without leaning forward on their arms. Then they can discover all the wonderful things the 

## world has to offer from this new vantage point. 

## Gaining more control of hands & feet 

## By the fourth month, your baby is also getting better control of their hands. For example, most babies can easily bring 

## interesting objects to their mouth now. During their next four months, they'll begin to use their fingers and thumbs in 

## a mittenor claw-like grip or raking motion. They'll manage to pick up many things. 

## Your baby won't develop the pincer grasp with index finger and thumb until about nine months old. But by the sixth to 

## eighth month, they'll learn to transfer objects from hand to hand, and turn and twist them. Be sure to remove any 

## objects from his environment that he could choke on or injure himself with. 

## As their physical coordination improves, your baby will discover new parts of their body. Lying on their back, they can 

## now grab their feet and toes and bring them to their mouth. While being diapered, they may reach down to touch 

## their genitals. When sitting up, he may slap his knee or thigh. Through these explorations he'll discover many new 

## and interesting sensations. They'll start to understand the function of body parts. 

## When you place their feet on the floor, they may curl their toes and stroke the surface, use his feet and legs to practice 

## “walking," or bounce up and down. Watch out! These are all preparations for the next major milestones: crawling and 

## standing.
