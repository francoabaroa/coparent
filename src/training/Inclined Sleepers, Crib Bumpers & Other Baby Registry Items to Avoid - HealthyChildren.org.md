# Inclined Sleepers, Crib Bumpers & Other Baby Registry 

# Items to Avoid 

## By: Dina DiMaggio, MD, FAAP 

## Having a baby is an incredibly exciting time! Many 

## parents set up baby registries for items that they 

## believe their baby will need. However, it's important to 

## know that some popular products are unnecessary and 

## can actually be dangerous for infants. Examples include 

## inclined sleepers, positioners and crib bumpers. 

## Each year, about 3,400 infants 

## (https://www.cdc.gov/sids/data.htm) in the United 

## States die unexpectedly during sleep. This can happen 

## from accidental suffocation, sudden infant death 

## syndrome (SIDS) or unknown causes. 

## To help prevent these deaths, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends 

## (https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/138/5/e20162938) that all infants should sleep on flat and firm 

## surfaces. Babies should sleep by themselves, without any bumpers, soft bedding, pillows or stuffed toys. Crib 

## bumpers and inclined infant sleeper products can cause a baby to suffocate. We also advise against using products 

## that are for infant bedsharing (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/a-parents-guide-to-safe-sleep.aspx) with 

## parents. 

## Here's why inclined sleepers, crib bumpers and other dangerous infant sleep products should stay off your registry 

## and out of your home. 

## Inclined baby sleepers and positioners 

## These are sometimes called baby nests, docks, pods, loungers, rockers or nappers. Infant positioners and inclined 

## sleepers have been popular items on baby registry lists for years. 

## The CPSC says (https://www.cpsc.gov/SafeSleep) that sleep products that incline more than 10 degrees are not safe. 

## Soft and plush sleep surfaces are also dangerous. Inclined sleepers allow babies to sleep at a 30-degree angle. Infants 

## placed in these products may fall asleep in a chin-to-chest position, which can restrict their airway. They can also roll 

## out of the devices and become trapped under them. Inclined sleepers have been tied to at least 94 deaths. 

## With sleep positioners, babies can suffocate after rolling onto their stomachs since they can't lift their heads. The soft 

## padding can make it difficult to breathe if a baby's face presses against it. 


### Recalled sleepers 

##### Parents are advised to stop using the Fisher-Price Rock ‘n Play Sleeper immediately and get a refund or voucher. In 

##### January 2023, the CPSC once again announced a recall (https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2023/Fisher-Price

##### Reannounces-Recall-of-4-7-Million-Rock-n-Play-Sleepers-At-Least-Eight-Deaths-Occurred-After-Recall) involving 

##### 4.7 million of these sleepers. Roughly 100 deaths reportedly occurred while infants were using the product. CPSC 

##### officials said several more babies have died (https://www.cpsc.gov/About-CPSC/Commissioner/Richard

##### Trumka/Statement/Eight-New-Deaths-in-Rock-n-Play-as-Tragedies-Mount-in-Fisher-Price-Products-CPSC

##### Working-on-a-Rule-that-Could-Prevent-the-Next-Wave-of-Deaths) since the original recall in 2019. Contact: 866

##### 812-6518 or the Mattel recall website (https://service.mattel.com/us/recall/default.asp?recall_id=52466). 

##### In addition, Kids2 Rocking Sleepers have been recalled after 5 infant fatalities were reported after the infants rolled 

##### from their back to their stomach or side while unrestrained. Contact: 866-869-7954 or visit Rocking Sleeper recall 

##### (https://www.kids2.com/pages/sleeper-recall-us-models) for a refund. 

### Warnings about infant loungers 

##### The CPSC warns families to stop using Podster, Podster Plush, Bummzie, and Podster Playtime infant loungers after 

##### two deaths. These products are not marketed as sleepers, but it is common for babies to fall asleep while using them. 

##### Infants are at risk of suffocating if their noses or mouths become blocked. 

##### If you have one of these products being investigated by the CPSC or recalled, stop using it right away. Visit the CPSC 

##### website (https://www.cpsc.gov/) for recall instructions. They also have a website (https://www.saferproducts.gov/) 

##### where safety concerns about infant products can be reported. 

## Crib bumpers 

##### Crib bumpers were long considered staples of nursery décor. They were originally intended to cushion babies from 

##### the crib slats. Crib bumpers are dangerous because of the risk of suffocation, entrapment, and strangulation. Plus, 

##### older babies may use the bumpers to stand on and climb out of the crib, creating a fall risk. Crib bumpers have been 

##### linked to more than 100 infant deaths during the past 30 years. 

##### In addition to traditional padded bumpers, stores now sell mesh bumpers and vertical crib liners. But even these can 

##### get loose and become a strangulation risk. Babies can also get trapped between them and the crib mattress. 

##### There is no evidence that crib bumpers—of any kind—prevent injury in young infants. 

##### Cribs today are regulated by the CPSC and have updated safety standards. The slats are closer together to prevent 

##### your baby's head from getting stuck. This means that bumpers are not only dangerous, but unnecessary. Maybe you're 

##### concerned about your child's leg getting stuck between crib slats. If so, use a wearable blanket or sleeping sack that's 

##### the right size for your baby. 

## New federal safety standards on the way 

##### A safe sleep environment is so important that the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has approved a 

##### federal safety standard for infant sleep products in 2021. By mid-2022, this standard will help get rid of potentially 

##### dangerous baby sleep products such as inclined sleepers, in-bed sleepers, loungers, and travel/compact sleepers. 

##### These products will have to meet the same CPSC standards that are already in place for cribs, bassinets, play yards and 

##### bedside sleepers. 

##### In addition, the Safe Cribs Act (https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2022/aap-statement-on

##### passage-of-the-safe-sleep-for-babies-act/) was signed into law in May 2022. This legislation will make it illegal to sell, 

##### distribute, manufacture or import crib bumpers and inclined sleep products. 

## Why are these unsafe infant products still sold? 

##### Unfortunately, the new CPSC regulations don't take effect until mid-2022, and infant product suppliers have until later 

##### this year to comply with the Safe Cribs Act. This means that inclined sleepers and positioners may still be available. 

##### Some stores, online retailers, cities, and states, have already stopped selling or have banned inclined sleepers and crib 

##### bumpers. Some companies have also issued voluntary recalls 

##### (https://www.aappublications.org/news/2019/04/12/rocknplayrecall041219) of these products. 

##### Even in areas where these dangerous products are banned, they can still turn up at secondhand stores or garage sales. 

##### It's important to check the CPSC website (https://www.saferproducts.gov/PublicSearch) to see if products have been 

##### recalled before using them. To stay updated on the latest recalls, you can even sign up

##### (https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/Subscribe) for CPSC email alerts. Also, make sure anyone who watches your child 

##### knows about recalled and unsafe products. 

## Remember 

##### It's also important to keep in mind that your baby should only sleep in products that are designed to be safe sleep 

##### spaces, like cribs, bassinets and portable play yards. Other products like swings, reclined seats, bouncers, and other 

##### sitting or positioning devices are not safe for sleep. If your baby falls asleep in one of these, move her to a safe sleep 

##### space right away. 

##### If you have any questions about safe sleep products for your baby, talk with your pediatrician.
