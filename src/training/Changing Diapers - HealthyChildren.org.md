# Changing Diapers 

## By: Laura A. Jana, MD, FAAP & Jennifer Shu, MD, FAAP 

## Becoming a parent usually involves changing a lot of 

## diapers—as many as 8 to 12 a day once you get into the 

## swing of things. Most U.S. parents will go through 

## nearly 3,000 diapers during their baby's first year alone 

## and average six diaper changes a day for an estimated 

## total of 8,000 over the course of a baby's diaper-wearing 

## career. 

## From choosing a good spot to change your baby's diaper 

## to perfecting your technique, there are ways to make it 

## easier. 

## Location, location, location 

## Wherever you choose to change your baby's diaper—whether it's on your brand-new changing table or next to you on 

## your bed—you'll want to prepare the area so everything you need is accessible. At a minimum, this means a diaper and 

## something to wipe with. Changing tables are clearly the norm when it comes to location. 

## Some people, one of us included, even opt to have more than one around the house. As convenient as they may be, you 

## should be aware, if you aren't already, that changing tables aren't really necessary. If you decide you don't want your 

## diaper changing to be limited geographically by where your changing table happens to be, or you want to save 

## yourself the expense, simply consider keeping diapers accessible in convenient locations around the house (and in 

## the car, once you start to venture out). That way, you can limit how far you have to go to take care of business. 

## Changing pads 

## Some people opt to use a simple diaper-changing pad in lieu of the table, and the floor, bed, or couch or even the back 

## seat of your car can easily serve the same purpose once you are comfortable with the routine. That said, some 

## particularly messy episodes might require not only a new diaper but also an extra pair of hands, a new outfit, and even 

## a trip to the tub. On such occasions, you'll be much better off if you choose your changing station close to all your 

## supplies. 

## Disposable changing pads, available in most drugstores and sometimes referred to as bed liners, underpads, or "chux," 

## can be helpful in protecting your changing table, crib, bed, floor, or wherever else you may choose to set up shop. 

## These are especially good when you're away from home because they can be used first as a changing pad and then to 

## wrap the dirty diaper for a quick and easy disposal. If you're at home and don't mind a bit of extra laundry, a towel can 

## easily serve the same purpose. 

## The technique 

## Before starting to change your baby's diaper, keep in mind that some babies have a tendency to pee as soon as they are 

## exposed to open air. By keeping them relatively covered as much as you can during the course of a diaper change, you 

## can help keep yourself, your changing surface, and your baby's clothes from getting unnecessarily wet. 

## If your baby is cooperative, which most babies are at least until they learn how to roll (somewhere around four months 

## of age), you can first lift their legs with one hand. Using your other hand, place an opened clean diaper under their 

## still-diapered bottom Make sure you have the picture side of the new diaper in front, face down on the changing 

## surface, and the side with the tabs underneath your baby. 

## Once you have your clean diaper appropriately positioned, go ahead and unfasten the old diaper. Wipe your baby's 

## bottom with the front (inner side) of it as you remove it. While you clearly don't have to wipe with the old diaper 

## before taking it off, doing so often removes a significant amount of poop before you reach for your first baby wipe. 


#### If the old diaper isn't overwhelmingly messy, leaving it folded over on itself but still under your baby's bottom can help 

#### prevent their still-dirty bottom from getting the new diaper soiled before you've had the chance to clean them up. It 

#### can also serve to absorb any new pee that may present itself during the uncovered stage of the diaper change. Next, 

#### wipe your baby's bottom and surrounding dirty areas with a baby wipe (/English/ages-stages/baby/diapers

#### clothing/Pages/A-Word-on-Wipes.aspx), moist tissue, or washcloth. 

#### Then remove the old diaper, along with the wipes, from underneath your baby and find a "safe" place to set them so 

#### you don't end up with your baby's foot in poop or find yourself with a new mess to clean up after accidentally knocking 

#### the diaper and its contents onto the floor. 

#### Securing the new diaper simply involves making sure that the front of the diaper is centered between the legs and 

#### pulled up to at least the same level in the back that it is in the front—usually around the level of the belly button. 

#### Check to see that the tabs are evenly secured in the front so there aren't any gaps around the hips. 

#### Also, to help prevent leakage, make sure the fringe around the legs isn't tucked into the diaper's elastic edges. 

## A word on changing a boy's diaper 

#### Baby boys are notorious for indiscriminately spraying their parents, grandparents, and pediatricians. Simply being 

#### aware of this inherent hazard can help limit the amount of time you leave yourself vulnerable during a diaper change. 

#### So can holding your hand, a diaper, or a tissue over your baby's penis during the process. 

#### If you find yourself caught in the line of fire, take comfort in knowing it happens to the best of us. While it may not 

#### help you much, those of us in the medical profession who have been peed on more than once find some comfort in 

#### reminding ourselves that urine is, after all, a sterile bodily fluid. If you can get the diaper on without being doused but 

#### nevertheless find yourself faced with urine sneaking out of your baby boy's diapers, you can also try aiming his penis 

#### downward before covering it with the diaper.
