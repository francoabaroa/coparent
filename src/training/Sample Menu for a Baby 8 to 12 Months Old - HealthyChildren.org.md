# Sample Menu for a Baby 8 to 12 Months Old 

## Now that your baby is eating solid foods, planning meals 

## can be more challenging. At this age, your baby needs 

## between 750 and 900 calories each day, of which about 

## 400 to 500 should come from breast milk 

## (/English/ages

## stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Breastfeeding

## Mealtime-Milestones.aspx) or formula (if you are not 

## breastfeeding)—roughly 24 ounces (720 mL) a day. 

## Breast milk and formula contain vitamins, minerals, 

## and other important components for brain growth. 

## At about eight months, you may want to introduce 

## foods that are slightly coarser than strained pureed 

## foods. They require more chewing than baby foods. You can expand your baby's diet to include soft foods such as 

## yogurt, oatmeal, mashed banana, mashed potatoes, or even thicker or lumpy pureed vegetables. Eggs (including 

## scrambled) are an excellent source of protein, as are cottage cheese, Greek yogurt, and avocado. 

## Sample menu ideas for an 8to 12-month-old baby: 

## Breakfast 

## 2 to 4 ounces cereal, or 1 mashed or scrambled egg 

## 2 to 4 ounces mashed or diced fruit 

## Breastmilk or 4 to 6 ounces formula 

## Snack 

## Breastmilk or 4 to 6 ounces formula 

## 2 to 4 ounces diced cheese or cooked pureed or diced vegetables 

## Lunch 

## 2 to 4 ounces yogurt or cottage cheese, or pureed or diced beans or meat 

## 2 to 4 ounces cooked pureed or diced yellow or orange vegetables 

## Breastmilk or 4 to 6 ounces formula 

## 1 cup = 8 ounces = 240 ml 

## ¾ cup = 6 ounces = 180 ml 

## ½ cup = 4 ounces = 120 ml 

## ¼ cup = 2 ounces = 60 ml
