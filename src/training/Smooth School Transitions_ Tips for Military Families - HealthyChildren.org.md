# Smooth School Transitions: Tips for Military Families 

## One of the greatest challenges for some military families is to 

## ensure children receive a fine education despite frequent moves 

## (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/Pages/Helping-Children

## Adjust-to-a-Move.aspx). 

## Steps to Prepare for the Move 

## Preparing for the move may set the stage for success. Several 

## months before the move, parents can begin to familiarize the family 

## with schools in the community. The Internet is a great resource for 

## this. 

## District & School Web sites 

## Parents and children can visit the district and school Web sites looking for academic credentials and programs, 

## athletics, and clubs available. Many Web sites have posted additional information and news updates about the 

## campus. Such information can help allay your child’s fears. 

## A school’s Web site may provide information about schedules and calendars, including start dates, holidays, and end 

## dates. These are not standardized from state to state, nor even within a state. Incorrectly assuming your children’s 

## new school schedule is similar to their current schools can result in their enrollment being days and even weeks later 

## than the official start date of the district. Classes in which they wish to enroll may be full, friendships are already 

## solidifying, and athletic teams may have a cutoff date for students wishing to make the team. 

## School Records 

## Hand carrying school records is vital in a school move. These records may include a photocopy of a cumulative folder, 

## withdrawal paperwork, report cards, information on textbooks used, and a copy of the student’s health record. Calling 

## the person in charge of registration, likely a counselor or registrar, several weeks prior to the move will give time to 

## copy these documents. It will also give the counselor or registrar the opportunity to let you know what you need to do 

## to withdraw your child from the school. 

## You need to hand carry documentation related to any special programs your child is enrolled in, whether enrichment, 

## gifted, accelerated, special education (/English/health-issues/conditions/learning-disabilities/Pages/Special

## Education.aspx), or 504 services (/English/health-issues/conditions/adhd/Pages/Section-504-and-IDEA

## Coverage.aspx). The receiving school may send a formal request for records to the sending school, and the documents 

## you provide at the time of registration may be the only information the new school has to make informed placement 

## decisions. This is extremely important for students receiving special education and 504 services. The information you 

## provide may be instrumental in your child receiving services seamlessly; without that information your child may 

## experience a lapse in services. 

## Once You Arrive 

## When you arrive at your new community, a trip to your child’s campus can give him an idea of what to expect. The 

## school may give him a tour and a map so he can familiarize himself with the facility. Knowing where the cafeteria, 

## auditorium, restrooms, and counselor’s office are can go a long way to helping a student settle in to a new routine. 

## Getting Involved 

## This presents an opportunity to explore what clubs and athletics are available for your child and how to go about 

## joining them. Remember that although your biggest concerns may be about academics, your child’s biggest concern 

## may be about finding his locker or a group to sit with at lunch. 


#### Parents can read and discuss the school’s expectations for conduct and dress with their child. 

#### Meeting your child’s principal or assistant principal, counselor, and teachers will go far to establish a personal 

#### connection. They may go further out of their way to ensure your child adjusts well. 

#### Volunteering on your child’s campus or joining a parent organization such as the PTA can help you make contacts at 

#### the school (/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/school/Pages/How-to-Get-Involved-With-Your-Childs

#### School.aspx)while making you and your child more comfortable in new surroundings. 

### Fitting In 

#### Fitting in is vitally important to children and adolescents. A visit to the school’s Web site can show pictures of 

#### students in the new community. Once you have arrived, look around the community to see what clothing, shoes, 

#### hairstyles, and accessories local kids are wearing. It may be that a few purchases would be all it takes to ease your 

#### child into his new life in his new community. 

## Where to Turn For Additional Help with the Transition 

#### Many organizations work to help students transition to new schools. One organization particularly worthy of notice 

#### here is the Military Child Education Coalition (MCEC) (http://www.militarychild.org/). It is devoted to helping schools 

#### and military installations deliver accurate, timely information to meet transitioning parent and student needs. It 

#### focuses on ensuring quality educational opportunities for all military-connected children affected by mobility, family 

#### separation, and transition.
