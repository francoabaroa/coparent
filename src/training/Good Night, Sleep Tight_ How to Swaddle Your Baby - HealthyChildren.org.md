# Good Night, Sleep Tight: How to Swaddle Your Baby 

## By: Laura A. Jana, MD, FAAP & Jennifer Shu, MD, FAAP 

## We'll be the first to admit that going belly up doesn't 

## always seem to agree with all babies. While it seems to 

## vary, we've found that quite a few babies are prone to 

## startling themselves awake from peaceful slumber. 

## That's because all babies are at the whim of their own 

## reflexes (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Newborn

## Reflexes.aspx)—which, by definition, they cannot 

## control—and are born with one particularly 

## inconvenient reflex (the startle, or Moro, reflex). 

## The Moro reflex causes infants to jerk suddenly, flail 

## their arms and legs, and even cry out in response to being startled—hence the name. And yes, even when you've gone 

## to great lengths to create a startle-free environment for your sleeping baby, they may just take matters into their own 

## hands (and feet), startle themself awake and then flail around until someone comes to their rescue. But don't give up 

## on uninterrupted sleep just yet, because there is something quick and easy you can do: a handy little technique we call 

## the "burrito wrap." 

## The burrito wrap 

## Most commonly referred to as swaddling (/English/ages-stages/baby/diapers-clothing/Pages/Swaddling-Is-it

## Safe.aspx), wrapping your baby up as snug as a bug in a baby blanket before putting them down to sleep can be helpful. 

## While there is no shortage of readily available, commercially made swaddling blankets, it's also possible to bundle 

## your baby at home simply using a regular baby blanket. 

## Hands down, the most talented people we've ever seen at this sleep-saving technique are the nurses in the newborn 

## nursery. These baby-bundling experts take uncomfortably free and exposed newborns and almost effortlessly have 

## them bundled in blissful, no-flailing-allowed slumber in the blink of an eye. If you have an opportunity, we highly 

## recommend watching these professionals in action. 

## For those of you who are already home and either missed out on the hospital demonstration or could use a little 

## refresher course, we've laid out the details for you as best we can without actually being there to demonstrate in 

## person. 

## Swaddling in 6 steps 

## 1. Lay a thin baby blanket out like a diamond in front of you. 

## 2. Fold the top corner of the blanket down a bit so that the folded corner almost reaches the middle of the blanket. 

## 3. Place your infant on their back and center them on the blanket with their arms at their sides, their head just 

## above the folded edge and their shoulders just below it. 

## 4. Take one of the side corners of the blanket and fold it over your baby's shoulder and across his body, making sure 

## to tuck the corner underneath him on the opposite side. 

## 5. Then take the bottom corner of the blanket (below your baby's feet) and fold it up over your baby. If the blanket is 

## large enough that the bottom corner reaches up to (or over) your baby's face, you can simply fold it back down 

## until their face is no longer covered or bring it over one or the other shoulder and tuck it under them. 

## 6. Finally, take the only remaining corner and pull it over your baby's other shoulder and across their body. Again, 

## tuck this corner snugly under your baby's opposite side. 


#### Once you have the general idea, remember that variations are perfectly acceptable. Feel free to play around with what 

#### works best for you and your baby. While the exact details and the order in which you do them may not matter too 

#### much in the end, we will point out that there is a good reason why we recommend folding the bottom of the blanket up 

### before flipping the last corner across (i.e., step 5 always before step 6) and always tucking corners under your baby; 

#### doing so helps to keep your handiwork from coming undone quite as easily. 

#### However, if you find your swaddling technique to be less than secure, you may want to opt out of the do-it-yourself 

#### approach and use a blanket designed specifically to stay in place. (Note: the American Academy of Pediatrics does not 

#### recommend (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/A-Parents-Guide-to-Safe-Sleep.aspx) using weighted swaddles, 

#### weighted blankets or other weighted objects like rice-filled bags (/English/tips-tools/ask-the-pediatrician/Pages/bag

#### of-rice-on-a-baby%e2%80%99s-tummy-to-help-them-sleep.aspx) inside a swaddling blanket. ) 

#### Of course, you'll need to always make sure the swaddle is not so snug as to potentially restrict your baby's breathing. 

#### As a rule of thumb, this means you should be able to fit two or three fingers between the swaddle and your baby's 

#### chest. 

## Hands-free bundling 

#### Some of our esteemed parenting colleagues suggest doing whatever it takes (with regard to bundling, that is) to 

#### ensure that your baby's arms and legs stay snugly secured in the blanket. Other equally convincing and respectable 

#### experts recommend never restricting your baby's arms—focusing your bundling attention on just your baby's legs 

#### while allowing their arms free rein. While there is admittedly no evidence to lend support to either approach, we 

#### personally have tried bundling both ways with good results. If you find that your baby seems unhappy having their 

#### arms "pinned down" by their sides instead of up next to their head, then just go ahead and burrito wrap them without 

#### placing their arms inside. 

## Safe swaddling 

#### Swaddling can be an effective technique to help calm infants and promote sleep when done correctly. Most child 

#### health experts agree that a baby's hips should not be bundled too tightly. Instead, they should be allowed to relax in 

#### their natural frog-leg positions to allow for proper growth and joint development. 

#### For safety (/English/ages-stages/baby/diapers-clothing/Pages/Swaddling-Is-it-Safe.aspx) reasons, you should always 

#### be sure that your swaddled baby is on their back—never on their side or tummy. Swaddling also has the potential to 

#### cause babies to overheat, so be sure to check and make sure your baby isn't showing signs of overheating (sweating, 

#### damp hair, rash and rapid breathing). And you should stop swaddling your baby once they look like they're trying to 

#### roll (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/a-parents-guide-to-safe-sleep.aspx)over.
