# Development at Home 

## Anne H. Zachry, PhD, OTR/L 

## Looking for new ways to entertain and play with your 

## young child? Thankfully, all you need is loving 

## attention and some basic household items. 

## Try these time-tested activities, suggested by age, and 

## let the fun happen! 

## Newborn to 3 Months 

## Puppet Play. Make a hand puppet using a sock. Move it 

## up and down and back and forth where your baby can 

## see it, doing a silly dance and singing silly songs. You can even have the puppet give her kisses! 

## Footloose. Gently dance with your baby positioned over your shoulder. She will enjoy the movement and at the same 

## time will learn to tolerate the slight pressure against her tummy. 

## Pat-a-Cake. Hold your baby's hands and gently clap them together to play a game of pat-a-cake: 

## Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, baker's man (Take baby's hands through the motions) 

## Bake me a cake as fast as you can 

## Roll it (Roll her hands around each other) and pat it (Clap) 

## and mark it with a B (Guide her finger to write a B in the air) 

## And put it in the oven for baby and me (Kiss your baby!) 

## Can't Smile Without You. Lie down on the floor,tummy down facing your baby. Try to get her to smile by sticking out 

## your tongue, smiling at her, and making other funny faces. You may even hear your infant's first giggle! 

## 4 to 6 months 

## Little Piggy Game. Hold your baby's foot up and wiggle each toe while teaching the classic "This Little Piggy" poem in 

## an animated, singsong way. Don't forget to give your infant a tickle at the end! 

## This little piggy went to market (big toe) 

## This little piggy stayed home (second toe) 

## This little piggy had roast beef (third toe) 

## This little piggy had none (fourth toe) 

## And this little piggy went wee wee wee all the way home (little toe) 

## Mustang Sally. Sit on the floor with your baby sitting on your raised knees. While holding on to her, slowly move your 

## legs side to side and sing "Ride a Little Horsey." When you say, "don't fall down," slide your feet forward! 


#### Ride a little horsey 

#### Down to town 

#### Oops, little horsey 

#### Don't fall down! 

##### Crocodile Rock. Hold your baby securely, tummy down on your chest. Rock your body from side to side and sing a 

##### song like "Row, Row, Row Your Boat." 

### Homemade Toy: Stacking Baby Blocks 

##### Collect different-sized clean milk cartons, small boxes and toilet paper rolls. Stuff each with newspaper or tissue 

##### paper. Fold the ends down to create blocksand cylinders, then close them with masking or duct tape. Use a variety of 

##### fun colors of contact paper or duct tape to cover each block. 

##### Free Fallin'. Stack up some blocks and encourage your baby to bat at and reach for them. Most infants absolutely love 

##### to see and hear the blocks tumble to the ground! 

## 7 to 9 months 

##### Fly Me to the Moon. Carefully lift your baby up over your head and back down while playing or singing a song like, 

##### "Fly me to the moon!" If your child seems fearful, move more slowly and talk in a calm, soothing voice. 

##### See You Later, Alligator. With your baby seated in front of you, hide a rattle under a blanket or behind your back. 

##### Shake the rattle while hiding it and see what happens. If your baby loses interest once it's hidden, reveal part of the 

##### rattle and ask, "Where's the toy?" 

##### If the Hat Fits. Sit just in front of baby, place a colorful hat on your head and say, "Look! The hat is on my head." Then 

##### remove it and say, "Now the hat is off." Next, put the hat on and off your infant's head! Encourage your baby to reach for 

##### the hat for more play. 

##### The Humpty Dance. Sit your infant on your lap, either sitting up or tummy down, and gently bounce your legs up and 

##### down. For more fun, do this while using a rocking chair! 

## 10 to 12 months 

##### Be-Bop Baby. Seat your baby upright on the floor, legs separated just enough to place a medium-sized ball between 

##### them. Show your baby how to roll the ball in your direction, then roll the ball back. Continue taking turns. 

##### Marching On. While seated, stand your baby on your thighs. Hold your baby's hips and slowly make stepping 

##### motions by moving your legs up and down, one side at a time. Sing your favorite song. 

##### You Light Up My Life. Shine a flashlight on the wall. Once your baby sees the light, move it slowly from one side of the 

##### room to the other and up and down to encourage visual tracking. 

### Homemade Toy:Baby Drums 

##### Cover an oatmeal box or coffee can with colorful contact paper and use plastic baby spoons as drumsticks. (Or, 

##### simply give your child a saucepan and a short wooden spoon.) 

##### Beat It. Show your baby different ways to tap a drum using the palms of your hands, your fingertips, or a baby spoon. 

##### See if your baby can imitate you. 

## 12-24 months 

##### The Big Squeeze. Take colorful kitchen sponges and cut them into fun sizes and shapes to fit into your child's hand at 

##### bath time (/English/ages-stages/baby/bathing-skin-care/Pages/Bathing-Your-Newborn.aspx). Show your little one 

##### how to sink a sponge underwater, watch it fill up, then hold it up and squeeze the water out.

### Homemade Toy: Toddler Tambourine 

##### Tape two sturdy paper plates securely together halfway around using colorful duct tape. Fill the tambourine half-full 

##### of dry cereal, tape the paper plates together the rest of the way, and shake! 

##### Mr. Tambourine Man. Show your little one how to shake and tap a tambourine to make noise. Add more ways, like 

##### tapping it against your hip, over your head, and in various directions. 

##### Poking Fun. Show your baby how to press numbers on an old phone or peck on an old keyboard. Glue different 

##### textures of fabric at the bottom of each section of an egg carton or old ice tray. Let your baby feel the various textures. 

## Remember 

##### You have the knowledge and tools to make play (/English/ages-stages/toddler/fitness/Pages/Caution-Children-at

##### Play.aspx) a fun and stimulating part of your baby's daily routine. Keep it simple, be flexible, and do what works for you 

##### and your child.
