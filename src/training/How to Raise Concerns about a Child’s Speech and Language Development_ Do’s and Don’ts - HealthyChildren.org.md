# How to Raise Concerns about a Child’s Speech and 

# Language Development: Do’s and Don’ts 

## Grandparents, friends, or neighbors who are worried about a child's 

## speech and/or language development may hesitate to bring it up for 

## fear of upsetting or offending a parent. While raising any concern 

## to parents about their child is difficult, it is in a child's best interest 

## to have any speech and/or language issues identified and treated as 

## early as possible. 

## Below are some do's and don'ts for talking respectfully and 

## productively about a potential communication delay. 

## DO'S 

## DO learn developmental milestones. Before sounding the alarm, refer to a list of speech and language 

## milestones by age (http://www.asha.org/public/speech/development/chart/). Also look at the early signs of 

## speech and language disorders (http://www.identifythesigns.org/). There may be no reason to worry. Share the 

## milestones and your concerns with parents, especially if a child is not doing what is expected. 

## In this public service announcement from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), Dr. Jennifer Shu 

## describes warning signs that a child may be missing a developmental milestone, and what to do.

## DO know that not all children are the same. At 12 months (/English/ages-stages/toddler/Pages/Language

## Development-1-Year-Olds.aspx), one child may be saying one word while another may be speaking 10 or more. 

## This variability is typical—not every child has the same communication skills at the same age. The 

## developmental milestones account for an expected range in skills. 

## If a child is learning more than one language (http://www.asha.org/public/speech/development/learn/), be 

## sure to count words in both languages. His or her development may be different than children who are only 

## learning one language. Also, note that learning more than one language does not cause or worsen speech or 

## language delays. 

## DO be sensitive when raising the issue. Try saying, "I saw a story on the news about children's speech and 

## language development...," or phrasing your concern as a question, e.g., "What do you think of Tommy's speech? 

## Has he been using new words?" 


#### DO share your family history of speech and language disorders, if known. Some disorders have a strong 

#### genetic component (/English/family-life/health-management/Pages/Your-Family-Health-History-and

#### Genetics.aspx) (a good example is stuttering), so this is important information to share. 

#### DO tell parents to ask for professional assistance. Encourage parents to set up an appointment with their 

#### child's doctor to discuss concerns. If concerns are confirmed, the doctor will make a referral for a speech and 

#### language evaluation. If the doctor is not concerned but the parents still are, the parents should trust their 

#### instincts and get a second opinion or have their child evaluated by a speech-language pathologist. A certified 

#### speech-language pathologist may determine there is no need to worry, and then the result is peace of mind. 

#### However, if there is a speech and/or language delay, it can be treated in a timely manner. 

#### DO provide resources to find help , if the child's doctor has not made any referrals for a speech and language 

#### evaluation. 

#### If the child is less than 3 years old: Parents can access their state's early intervention program. for a free 

### evaluation. See What is Early Intervention? (/English/health-issues/conditions/developmental

### disabilities/Pages/Early-Intervention.aspx). 

#### If the child is 3 years or older: Parents can contact a local elementary school and ask to speak with someone 

#### who can help and have their child evaluated — even if their child does not go to that school. This is a free 

#### service provided by local school districts. 

#### For the assistance of a private speech-language pathologist: Search the ASHA ProFind 

#### (http://www.asha.org/profind/) database. 

#### DO be sensitive to the family's values and norms. Individuals handle concerns about developmental delays 

#### differently based on their background, family values (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/communication

#### discipline/Pages/Share-Your-Values.aspx), and norms. There may be different approaches to how children are 

#### being raised. Be mindful and respectful of those differences as you consider talking with people outside of your 

#### family (e.g., neighbor, friend). 

## DON'TS 

#### DON'T compare siblings to each other. An older child may have been advanced for his or her age, resulting in 

#### concern when the second child is developing in a typical way. Again, look more broadly to expected 

#### developmental language milestones. 

#### DON'T place blame. Parents don't cause speech and language disorders. It is inaccurate and hurtful to tell a 

#### parent he or she should have done something differently. 

#### DON'T give labels. Do not try to diagnose the child. Instead, describe what you see. Leave a diagnosis to a speech

#### language pathologist, who is specially educated for identifying communication disorders. Share what the child 

### does well also (e.g., "I know Sarah uses a few single words, and I was curious when she should starting putting 

### multiple words together.") 

#### DON'T assume treatment is too expensive. Services may be free through the state's early intervention program 

#### or school system, offered on a sliding scale, or may be covered in part or full by insurance. There are options for 

#### families. 

#### DON'T "wait and see" if the child outgrows the problem. This is probably the most important point. Speech and 

#### language delays are highly treatable. The best outcomes occur when a child is seen by a professional 

#### early. Ideally, children will be treated long before entering kindergarten—and even before age 3, when children 

#### are in their most rapid period of development. Acting early can improve academic and social success, so speak 

#### up early.
