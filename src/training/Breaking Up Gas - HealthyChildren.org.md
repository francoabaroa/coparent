# Breaking Up Gas 

## We are big believers that there’s really no need for parents to pay a high price in exchange for 

## less gas. That said, if you find yourself going head to head with your baby’s gas, there are several 

## things you can reasonably do to try and remedy the situation—only some of which have anything 

## to do with eating. We simply suggest that you do so with only modest expectations, since 

## breaking up gas is definitely hard to do. 

## Find Foods at Fault 

## Although there are definitely some foods that are more suspect than others, identifying which 

## ones they are in a breastfeeding mother’s diet (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Eating-for-Two-Your

## Diet-And-Breastfeeding.aspx) is often easier said than done. While it is certainly worth paying attention to whether or 

## not a certain food or drink clearly causes your baby distress, just remember that food is not the only cause for gas. Be 

## sure not to randomly remove so many foods that you leave yourself with very little on your plate. 

## Formula for Success 

## Especially in a baby’s early formula-drinking (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Amount-and

## Schedule-of-Formula-Feedings.aspx)days, either consider holding off on mixing up powdered formula for the time 

## being and use concentrated or ready-to-feed formula instead, or let your freshly mixed powdered formula 

## (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Formula-Form-and-Function-Powders-Concentrates-and-Ready

## to-Feed.aspx) settle before serving. The more mixing and shaking involved, the more air bubbles get into the mix— 

## resulting in more swallowed air and potentially more gas. Be sure to discuss any formula changes with your 

## pediatrician. When an abundance of gas is involved, trying a different formula may well be just what your doctor 

## orders. 

## Slow the Flow 

## Help your baby swallow less air by slowing the flow of liquids from his bottle into his mouth. Trial and error with 

## different bottles and nipples tends to be the best approach. 

## Clear the Air 

## If your baby’s gas issues leave you wanting to better clear the air while bottle-feeding, also look for bottles (such as 

## those that are vented, angled, or collapsible) meant specifically to keep babies from swallowing extra air while 

## drinking. 

## Keep Things on the Up and Up 

## Try stepping up your burping (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Burping-Hiccups-and-Spitting

## Up.aspx) efforts by burping during, as well as after, each feeding. Just be forewarned—some babies don’t take at all 

## kindly to this sort of rude interruption. 

## Pump Your Own Gas 

## You can help get rid of unwanted gas by simply laying your baby flat on his back and moving his legs in a bicycling 

## motion. Better yet—give him some tummy time (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/Back-to-Sleep-Tummy-to

## Play.aspx). This not only can help keep his head from becoming flat (/English/news/Pages/Preventing-and-Treating

## Flat-Head-Syndrome-in-Babies-.aspx) while strengthening his upper body, but can put a lot of pressure on any gas 

## that’s thinking about settling in to be on its way out instead.

## Burst Their Bubbles 

### While there currently seems to be no inherent harm in reaching for a bottle of gas drops to break up your baby’s gas, 

### the best tip we have for you is that we’ve been told you can get your money back from either the manufacturer or the 

### pharmacy if you find they don’t work! Simethicone gas drops (such as Mylicon, Little Tummys gas relief drops, and 

### Phazyme) are thought to be safe to give—as often as 12 times a day, if necessary—and many parents do just that. But at 

### approximately $12 per 1-ounce (30 mL) bottle, they’re not exactly cheap. And studies suggest that they’re not that 

### effective either.
