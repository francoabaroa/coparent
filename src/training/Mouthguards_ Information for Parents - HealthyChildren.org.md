# Mouthguards: Information for Parents 

## Mouthguards can help protect your child from a dental emergency. 

## They should be worn whenever your child is participating in sports 

## (/english/healthy-living/sports/Pages/default.aspx) and 

## recreational activities. 

## Benefit of Mouthguards 

## Mouthguards, also called mouth protectors, help cushion a blow to 

## the face, minimizing the risk of broken teeth and injuries to your 

## lips, tongue, face or jaw. They typically cover the upper teeth and 

## are a great way to protect the soft tissues of your tongue, lips and 

## cheek lining. Knowing how to prevent injuries like these is 

## especially important if your child participates in organized sports or other recreational activities. 

## When it comes to protecting your mouth, a mouthguard is an essential piece of athletic gear that should be part of 

## standard equipment from an early age. In fact, studies show that athletes are 60 times more likely to suffer harm to 

## the teeth if they are not wearing a mouthguard. While collision and contact sports, such as boxing 

## (/English/news/Pages/Children-and-Teens-Shouldn't-Box-Say-Pediatricians.aspx), are higher-risk sports for the 

## mouth, you can experience a dental injury in non-contact activities too, such as gymnastics (/English/healthy

## living/sports/Pages/Gymnastics.aspx) and skating (/English/healthy-living/sports/Pages/Figure-Skating.aspx). 

## Three Types of Mouthguards: 

## Custom-fitted. These are made by your dentist for you personally. They are more expensive than the other versions, but 

## because they are customized, usually offer the best fit. 

## Stock. These are inexpensive and come pre-formed, ready to wear. Unfortunately, they often don’t fit very well. They can 

## be bulky and can make breathing and talking difficult. 

## Boil and bite. These mouth protectors can be bought at many sporting goods stores and drugstores and may offer a 

## better fit than stock mouth protectors. They are first softened in boiling water, then inserted and allowed to adapt to the 

## shape of your mouth. 

## The best mouthguard is one that has been custom made for your mouth by your dentist (/English/family-life/health

## management/pediatric-specialists/Pages/What-is-a-Pediatric-Dentist.aspx). However, if you cannot afford a custom

## fitted mouthguard, your child should still wear a stock mouthguard or a boil-and-bite mouthguard from the drugstore. 

## If your child wears braces or another fixed dental appliance on your lower jaw, your dentist may suggest a mouth 

## protector for these teeth as well. 

## A properly fitted mouthguard may be especially important for people who wear braces or have fixed bridge work. A 

## blow to the face could damage the brackets or other fixed orthodontic appliances. A mouthguard also provides a 

## barrier between the braces and your cheek or lips, limiting the risk of soft tissue injuries. 

## Talk to Your Child’s Dentist or Orthodontist 

## Talk to your dentist or orthodontist (/English/healthy-living/oral-health/Pages/Dental-Health-and-Orthodontic

## Problems.aspx) about selecting a mouthguard that will provide the best protection. Although mouthguards typically 

## only cover the upper teeth, your dentist or orthodontist may suggest that your child use a mouthguard on the lower 

## teeth if you have braces on these teeth too. 

## If your child has a retainer or other removable appliance, do not wear it during any contact sports.
