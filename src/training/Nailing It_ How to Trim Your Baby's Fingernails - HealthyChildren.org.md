# Nailing It: How to Trim Your Baby's Fingernails 

## By: Laura Jana, MD, FAAP & Jennifer Shu, MD, FAAP 

## Did you know that fingernails grow about 0.1 mm each 

## day, and they grow faster in young people, in males, and 

## in the summertime? Well, neither did we until we 

## looked it up, but it certainly doesn't surprise us. While 

## that may not seem like much on the surface, let us 

## assure you that your newborn's nails will keep you busy. 

## Keeping up with them as they continuously grow can 

## be a very demanding task. 

## As far as we're concerned, the real purpose baby nails 

## serve is to break you into parenthood. They will likely 

## require trimming or filing at least once a week, because long nails on the hands of newborns with little to no control of 

## them predictably result in stray scratches. If you happen to fall behind on your nail clipping, your baby will inevitably 

## remind you (and make you feel guilty) by scratching his face when his nails get too long (or if you leave sharp corners 

## or points when clipping). 

## Baby mittens: handy, up to a point 

## Many parents cover their newborn's hands with baby mittens or socks to prevent wayward nails from scratching their 

## faces. As your baby develops over the next several weeks (and you become more skilled at nail clipping), though, it's a 

## good idea to allow babies plenty of time during which they can freely explore with their hands. If scratches continue to 

## be a problem, we suggest limiting covered time to when your baby is sleeping. 

## The baby mani-pedi 

## A handful of parents are intimidated by the prospect of having to cut their baby's nails and would probably opt for a 

## professional manicure-pedicure if only it was generally available. No such luck. 

## If you're lucky, your hospital nurse will be able to help demonstrate the correct technique, but some hospitals dis 

## courage their personnel from doing so (we can only presume because any unintentional injury may be a liability 

## problem). And while we aren't exactly recommending it (or admitting to doing it ourselves), we're well aware that 

## some parents opt to bite or peel off their newborn's nails rather than fiddle with clippers or scissors. Be aware, 

## however, that doing so can potentially lead to infection. 

## Newborn nail-trimming tips 

## Because clippers and scissors can trim nails in a more controlled fashion, you'll be much better off using one or the 

## other (or both) or simply using a nail file to keep things under control. For best results: 

## Trim or file your baby's nails when she's asleep and her hands are less of a moving target. 

## Push down on the fingertip skin so you can get the clipper or scissors around both sides of the nail and avoid 

## cutting your baby's finger (or toe). 

## Then, just as a professional manicurist would, finish off any sharp or rough edges with an emery board and... 

## voil√†! 

## Not so bad after all, once you get the hang of it.
