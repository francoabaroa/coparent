# Family Arguments 

## We seem to have a lot of arguments in our family. Is this normal? 

## Disputes between you and your children are inevitable in family life. If your family never has arguments, it probably 

## means that issues are being avoided. To become productive adults, children need to be able to voice their opinions 

## even if they disagree with yours and feel they are being taken seriously. 

## Even so, you can and should keep the negative impact of arguments to a minimum. 

## Pick Your Battles 

## Be selective about the issues you fight over. When a potential problem arises, decide if it is really worth the battle; 

## some issues probably are not. For example, if your child wants to wear an old pair of sneakers to school rather than the 

## newer pair you recently bought her, or if she wants to wear her hair a little longer than you would prefer, you might 

## decide to let her have her way, choosing to take a stand on more important matters instead. Pick your battles carefully. 

## Be Open 

## Let your child win sometimes. When you and your youngster argue, you need to do more than listen to her point of 

## view; when she presents a persuasive case, be willing to say, "You convinced me. We'll do it your way." Let your 

## youngster know that you value her point of view, and that through communication, conflicts can be resolved and that 

## sometimes she can win. 

## Boundaries For Arguments 

## As long as arguments stay within certain boundaries, they are an acceptable and productive form of communication. 

## They can continue as long as they are under control, respectful and are moving toward a solution. But discontinue 

## them if they degenerate into name-calling, if calm voices are replaced by shouting or if you and your child are going 

## around in circles without progressing toward a resolution. Never laugh at your child, no matter how ludicrous her 

## arguments sound to you; by laughing you are essentially ridiculing her and what she is saying. 

## If you are unhappy with the essay your child wrote about the Civil War for school, for example, the two of you can 

## discuss what you perceive to be its shortcomings. But remember, it is her school assignment and her responsibility. 

## Her teacher is the ultimate judge. If the dialogue between you and your child starts to get personal ("You don't know 

## what you're talking about!"), then it's time for a break. Tell your child: "This discussion isn't going anywhere. We need 

## to stop, cool down and come back to it later." Resume the dialogue later in the day, when one or both of you might have 

## a new approach to the problem. 

## Some families actually schedule these follow-up discussions. A parent might say, "Come back with five points to 

## support your argument, and I'll have five to support mine." Families can even create a format for these dialogues: The 

## child speaks uninterrupted for five minutes, and then the parent responds during the next five minutes; after another 

## round of five minutes each, you might find areas where you can agree or compromise. 

## Recurrent Conflicts 

## If conflicts about particular issues recur again and again, take a look at the root causes. Think deeply about why you 

## and your child are arguing about these matters, and try taking some preventive action. 

## For example, if your youngster rebels against going to bed each night, she may be using her outbursts as a way to stay 

## up a little longer, or to get more attention. Or if she repeatedly argues about doing her homework, try to put an end to 

## these conflicts by actually writing up a contract stipulating the expectations, responsibilities, rewards and 

## punishments for doing and not doing homework. Remember that the homework assignment is made by the teacher 

## and is your child's responsibility. She may not do it your way, but if she is satisfying the school's requirements, you 

## should not turn it into an issue at home. Both you and your child should sign the contract, agree to abide by it, and 

## (hopefully) end the disagreements about the subject.

## Alliances 

### Some families draw a third person into the conflict, supposedly to mediate the difficulty, but who instead may take a 

### position on one side or the other and thereby make the disagreement worse. Sometimes when they are unable to 

### resolve their conflict, the warring parties may join together to focus attention on another family member as a way to 

### avoid dealing with the real problem. 

### Within every family, certain alliances, coalitions and rivalries exist. At times, mother and daughter might form an 

### alliance against father and son. Or the two parents might unite against the children on a particular issue. But within a 

### healthy family these coalitions are not fixed, they change from situation to situation, and they do not disrupt the 

### functioning of the family. If they become rigid and long-lasting, however, they can do damage to the family. 

### It is natural to be unaware that any alliances exist within your family. But to get a better sense of your family's 

### dynamics, ask yourself questions like: "What family member do I tend to agree (or disagree) with most often? When 

### my children are fighting, whose side do I generally take? With whom in the family do I usually spend my free time? 

### Who in the family most easily angers me?" 

## Children Learn By Example 

### Do not forget that children learn how to handle disagreements by watching their parents' example. How readily do 

### you and your partner have "good" arguments, which end in successful reconciliation? Or do you stay angry, or avoid 

### fights altogether? Your children model themselves on you.
