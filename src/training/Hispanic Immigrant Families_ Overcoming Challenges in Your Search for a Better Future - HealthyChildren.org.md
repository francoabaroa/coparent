# Hispanic Immigrant Families: Overcoming Challenges in 

# Your Search for a Better Future 

## By: Edith Bracho Sánchez, MD 

## Stories of endurance and determination are common among 

## Hispanic families who migrate to the United States. These families 

## are many in numbers—according to the American Community 

## Survey (ACS) (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/), 

## over 1.2 million new Hispanics arrived in the United States from 

## July 2014 to July 2015. The stories of many of these new immigrants 

## frequently have a common underlying theme: sacrifice in the 

## search of a better future for those we love—our children. 

## After the journey and facing a new culture and new challenges, 

## how can you best help your children attain that better future 

## you dreamed for them? How can you help them reach their fullest potential? 

## Every family—new immigrant, old immigrants, first generation, second, or third—faces their own unique set of 

## challenges. Regardless of what those unique challenges are to you, use the following tips in your daily interactions 

## with your children: 

## Raise your expectations. Children live either up or down to an adult's expectations of them. If you expect the 

## best, your children will tend to live up to those standards in their own way. It is important to understand, however, 

## that expecting the best doesn't necessarily mean getting straight A's or being the star athlete; it means being a 

## good human being—considerate, respectful, honest, generous, responsible, etc. Many of these character traits 

## are instilled at home. 

## Tell your children they can change the world. Even from an early age, children can learn the importance of 

## making the world a better place. Inspiring generosity (/English/family-life/Community/Pages/How-to-Inspire

## Generosity-in-Children.aspx) can help your children gain a sense of purpose and motivate them to do good for 

## others. Being an immigrant has given your children tolerance, empathy, and hope—help them see that. Your 

## children can start changing the world right in their own community. Volunteering, for example, will lead to 

## reinforcing "thank you's" and contribute to your children's overall sense of purpose. See Creating Opportunities 

## for Children & Teens to Contribute (/English/family-life/Community/Pages/Creating-Opportunities-for

## Children-Teens-to-Contribute.aspx) for suggestions. 

## Praise efforts and small successes. Help your children recognize even their smallest successes. When 

## celebrations are in order, celebrate in your own way—honoring your own culture and traditions. Maybe it is 

## homemade meals that have been a part of your child's life from an early age—arepas, empanadas, tamales, 

## buñuelos, pastel, etc. Celebrating your children's accomplishments in this way will feel special and important to 

## them. 

## Make it clear that you always have time to talk and listen. Many Hispanic parents are juggling many hats and 

## working very hard to make ends meet (/English/family-life/Community/Pages/Struggling-to-Make-Ends

## Meet.aspx). According to the 2016 U.S. Census Bureau (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/), just over 

## 20% of Hispanic immigrants live in poverty—that's 2 in every 10 families. Children can sense when their parents 

## are worried, overwhelmed, or simply burdened by the challenges of daily life. Take time to make time. As 

## children grow, it is important that they know they always come first. Having a good communication 

## (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/communication-discipline/Pages/Improving-Family

## Communications.aspx) system early on can reduce the chances of your children withholding information from 

## you later. Make it clear they are your number one priority. Ask questions. Show an interest. Remember things 

## important to them.

### Set family goals. In the same creative way your family works together to overcome challenges, you can sit with 

### your children to set goals for things such as volunteering a couple of hours per week, attending an additional 

### course or class after school, joining a team, etc. Pick the activities together, make them a family goal, and do your 

### best to help your children meet their responsibilities. This will make it clear to your children that their activities 

### are important and again reinforce their sense of purpose. 

### Remember, as a Hispanic family, you are already set up for success if your children are being raised with a strong 

### sense of family and much love!
