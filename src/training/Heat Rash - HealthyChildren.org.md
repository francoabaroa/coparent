# Heat Rash 

## Heat rash is seen most often in babies and young children. It occurs during hot and humid 

## weather. It is caused when the sweat gland openings become blocked. This results in little red 

## bumps around the sweat duct openings. 

## What to Look For: 

## Tiny red bumps in areas that tend to be moist 

## Commonly seen in skin folds of the neck and on the upper chest, arms, legs, and diaper area 

## What You Should Do: 

## Parents or primary caregiver should: 

## Dress the child (/English/ages-stages/baby/diapers-clothing/Pages/Dressing-Your-Newborn.aspx) in clothing 

## that keeps the skin cool and dry. 

## Pay special attention to skin folds that stay wet with perspiration, urine, or drool. 

## Use cool water to remove body oil and sweat. Then dry the area. 

## Leave areas open to air without clothing. 

## Use air conditioning or a fan blowing gently on your child to keep her cool. 

## Do not apply skin ointments. 

## Other caregivers should: 

## Tell parents if you notice a child has signs of prickly heat. 

## Try to keep the child cool. 

## Pay attention to moist areas. Wash with cool water. Keep these areas dry.
