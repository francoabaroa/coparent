# Sharenting: 5 Questions to Ask Before You Post 

## By: Claire McCarthy, MD, FAAP 

## If there's anything parents like to do, it's talk about their 

## children—and show pictures of them. This is normal. 

## It's good. It's about love, pride and building community. 

## But with the explosion of social media, those funny 

## stories—or cute pictures and videos—that you used to 

## share with just your family, your officemates or the 

## other parents at the playground can now be shared with 

## literally the entire world. Millions of them are being 

## shared, every day. 

## Most of the time, sharing isn't a big deal. But sometimes, it is. 

## The DaddyOfFive saga (http://people.com/crime/controversial-daddyofive-youtube-parents-lose-custody-of-2

## children-featured-in-prank-videos/)—in which a couple shared "pranking" videos of their children that bordered on 

## child abuse, and ended up losing custody of two of their children—is an extreme example of how "sharenting" can go 

## terribly wrong. But even though it is an extreme example, it's a cautionary tale about how what seems like a good idea 

## at the time can end up being a bad idea, for all sorts of reasons. 

## Nothing online is completely private, and everything is permanent. 

## You can use privacy settings, and you absolutely should, but there are always ways around them (such as screen shots) 

## —and even when you take something down, that doesn't mean it's completely gone. 

## Ultimately, it's not your information; it belongs to your children. 

## This second point is particularly important in this new digital age, where all of us have a "digital footprint." A quick 

## Google search can bring up all sorts of information about a person. It's one thing if you are an adult and have chosen to 

## post or share content about yourself—or have done things knowing they could be shared online. It's entirely another 

## if you had no say in it whatsoever—especially when the content might be embarrassing, or worse. Think of it this way: 

## your child has a right to privacy. 

## I've been writing about my children for years in magazine and online columns, and so I've thought about this a lot. I've 

## been careful not to write about things that would embarrass my children, and as soon as they were old enough, I gave 

## them editing rights (both for themselves and for their younger siblings). I may not have got it perfectly (I remember 

## one child being bummed about a magazine reference to the fact that she took a long time to potty train), but I've been 

## conscious of their right to choose what becomes public about them. 


### 5 Questions Parents Should Ask Themselves Before Sharing Anything About 

### their Children: 

##### Why are you sharing it? This is probably the most important question to ask, as it's not your information, it's 

##### your child's. You should have a good reason before you send content out into the world. Get in the habit of 

##### asking it of yourself before you post. 

##### Would you want someone to share it about you? This isn't always the perfect barometer, as you might be an 

##### extrovert who is happy to share and your child might grow up to be an introvert who likes to be private...but if 

##### you would be bummed if your parent shared a picture of you naked on a potty, maybe you shouldn't share the 

##### same picture of your child. If your child is old enough to ask, ask them. 

##### Could your child be embarrassed by it, now or in the future? Granted, it's part of the parental job 

##### description to embarrass our children. But it's one thing to tell an embarrassing story or show an embarrassing 

##### picture to a girlfriend or grandmother—and it's another thing to send the information out to the world. That's 

##### not in our job description. That's just mean. 

##### Is there anyone in the universe who shouldn't see this about your child, now or at any point in the 

##### future? If the answer is yes, don't share it. I know that sounds extreme, but it's growing more common for 

##### employers, college admission staff or possible romantic interests among others to do Internet searches about 

##### people. If what you are thinking of posting could come back to bite your child in any way ever, don't do it. And as 

##### a corollary... 

##### Is this something you want to be part of your child's digital footprint? Even if it's not embarrassing, how 

##### does it paint your child? Think about it. You'd probably like your child to come across as smart, well-behaved, 

##### industrious, kind and successful, right? Does what you are posting help that—or hinder it? 

##### It's a good idea to talk with your partner, to be sure you are on the same page (my husband always has editing rights 

##### too when I write about our children). It's also a good idea to discuss it as a family once your children are old enough to 

##### understand. It's a great opportunity to not just set family ground rules (after all, your children might share about you 

##### or their siblings) but also to talk about being good digital citizens. 

##### Because ultimately, that's what this is about: being thoughtful, careful, and kind.
