# Video Games Still Have a Big Smoking Problem: Here's 

# Why 

## While the important issue of violence in video games 

## (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/Virtual-Violence-Impacts

## Childrens-Behavior.aspx) is well-known, many may not realize how 

## many of the story lines feature tobacco use. 

## Tobacco products are prevalent in video games, used by the "cool" 

## characters to make them "tougher" or "grittier." In some cases, 

## players can choose to make their characters' use tobacco, and in 

## other cases, players have no choice about whether their characters' 

## use tobacco. In addition, tobacco products are often not reflected in 

## a game's rating (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/Video-Games

## Set-Your-Own-Ratings-System.aspx). 

## While there is a lot still to be learned about smoking and video games, we know enough to have serious, well-based 

## concerns. 

## Why Tobacco Use in Video Games is Likely to Promote Youth 

## Smoking: 

## The U.S. Surgeon General concluded that exposure to tobacco use in films (/English/family

## life/Media/Pages/Smoking-in-the-Movies.aspx) promotes youth smoking. Video games are likely to work in similar 

## ways. 

## These narratives contribute to the perception that smoking is common, and research has found that youth who 

## perceive smoking to be common in media are more likely to smoke. Advertising is also a key factor in youth tobacco 

## use initiation. The depiction of tobacco use in games serves, in effect, as free advertising for tobacco companies. And, 

## as a tobacco company report famously said in 1984, younger adults are the only source of replacement smokers. 

## Video Game Overload: 

## According to the 2015 Common Sense Census (https://www.commonsensemedia.org/research/the-common-sense

## census-media-use-by-tweens-and-teens), American teens aged 13-18 are exposed to an average of nearly nine hours of 

## entertainment media on any given day. 

## Playing video games ranks as the second favorite media activity for teens; 56% of teens play video, computer or mobile 

## games on any given day. Those teens who play games average two hours and 25 minutes per day. See Figure A below. 


##### Overall, teens spend more time per day on average playing video, computer or mobile games than using social media.

## The Problem with Video Game & App Ratings: 

##### Research shows that video game content descriptors often fail to mention tobacco use, making it difficult for parents 

##### to monitor games for tobacco imagery. 

##### A 2012 study (http://thelancet.com/article/S1470-2045(12)70099-2/abstract) found a steady increase over the past 

##### decade in tobacco content in video games rated appropriate for kids as young as 10. For example, of all new games 

##### introduced in 2011 that were rated "Everyone 10+" (content generally suitable for ages ten and up), 12.6% featured 

##### tobacco. The same study found that between 1994 and 2011, 60 out of 78 large publishers included tobacco imagery in 

##### at least one, and often more, of their games rated appropriate for youth. 

##### In a 2015 survey (http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/early/2015/08/24/tobaccocontrol-2015-052286), researchers 

##### verified tobacco content in 42% of the video games that participants reported playing; however, only 8% of these 

##### games had received tobacco warnings from the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB). 

### About ESRB Ratings: 

##### Created by the Entertainment Software Association in 1994, the ESRB is the gaming industry's self-regulatory 

##### organization that rates video games and apps. The ESRB assigns ratings, such as Everyone, Teen and Mature, to video 

##### games. It also provides descriptions of the content that factored into each game's rating and interactive elements. The 

##### content descriptors are "not intended to be a complete listing of content." 

##### The ESRB uses two different rating processes depending on the game's platform—meaning packaged/boxed 

##### games or digitally delivered games: 

##### 1. For packaged or boxed video games, publishers provide information to the ESRB prior to a game's release 

##### regarding "pertinent content, which essentially translates to anything that may factor into the game's rating," 

##### including the "most extreme content in the game." Pertinent content also includes "other relevant factors such as 

##### context, reward systems and the degree of player control." In addition, publishers provide the ESRB with a DVD, 

##### including the pertinent content. A committee of at least three ESRB trained raters, individuals with no ties to the 

##### video game industry, reviews the submission and recommends a rating and content descriptors. The ESRB 

##### reviews the recommendation and finalizes the rating. After the game is released, ESRB staff "play-tests a variety 

##### of games" to verify that the content disclosure was accurate and complete. 

##### 2. For digitally delivered games, publishers complete a questionnaire regarding content and interactive 

##### components. The rating is generated by an automated process based upon the responses to the questionnaire.

## What Parents Can Do: 

##### The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) strongly encourages parents and other adults to take these tips into 

##### consideration when purchasing games for tweens and teens. 

##### Monitor the content of games purchased for and used by youth. Share your family media rules with 

##### caregivers or grandparents—especially near gift-giving season—to help ensure rules are consistent. 

##### Set limits for video game use; kids need and expect them. Know your children's friends, both online and off. 

##### Know what platforms, software, and apps your children are using, what sites they are visiting on the web, and 

##### what they are doing online. 

##### Play a video game with your kids. It's a good way to demonstrate good sportsmanship and gaming etiquette. 

##### You will have the opportunity to introduce and share your own life experiences and perspectives—and talk to 

##### your kids about smoking—as you play the game. 

##### Recognize that many video games contain tobacco use , and be aware that ESRB content descriptors may fail 

##### to mention tobacco content—even when it is present in a game. 

##### Remember that your opinion counts—so make your voice heard. Urge the ESRB to rate games containing 

##### tobacco with a "Mature" rating and disclose tobacco use in all games where it occurs. Call on game developers 

##### and publishers to immediately stop including tobacco use and tobacco images in their games, particularly those 

##### marketed to or played by youth.
