# Baby Teething Pain 

## Discomfort from teething (/English/ages-stages/baby/teething

## tooth-care/Pages/Teething-4-to-7-Months.aspx), which may begin 

## as early as 3 months, can wake a baby. The gums around the 

## emerging teeth may be swollen and tender. 

## How to Ease Your Baby’s Teething Pain: 

## Chew toys 

## Plastic and rubber toys are great for soothing aching gums. 

## Note: Teething necklaces and bracelets (/English/ages

## stages/baby/teething-tooth-care/Pages/Amber-Teething

## Necklaces.aspx)are made of amber, wood, marble or silicone are choking and strangulation hazards; the Food and 

## Drug Administration (FDA) warns 

## (https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/AlertsandNotices/ucm628900.htm) against them. 

## Cold things 

## For help numbing and easing the ache and inflammation, try using damp washcloths that have been twisted and 

## frozen (tie one end in a knot for better gnawing). Avoid teething rings that are frozen solid; they are too hard for 

## children's mouths. 

## Massage 

## A light, gentle rub or massage might give your little one a lot of relief. Remember to wash your hands, then 

## massage the sore areas in your baby's mouth with your finger or knuckle. 

## Medication 

## Pain relievers intended to be rubbed on a baby’s gums aren’t very helpful; a teething baby drools so much that 

## the medication is quickly washed away. In addition, pediatricians warn that such medications can numb the back 

## of the throat and interfere with your baby’s ability to swallow. If your baby is clearly uncomfortable, talk to your 

## pediatrician about giving a dose of acetaminophen (Tylenol). Note: Numbing gels or creams that contain 

## benzocaine are not recommended for infants. 

## Side Effects of Teething: 

## Fever, vomiting, diarrhea 

## When your baby’s teeth are coming through, she may also have a very slight increase in temperature. But if her 

## temperature reaches 100.4°F (38°C) or above, it’s not because of teething. If your baby has symptoms such 

## as fever (/English/health-issues/conditions/fever/Pages/Fever-and-Your-Baby.aspx), vomiting (/English/health

## issues/conditions/abdominal/Pages/Infant-Vomiting.aspx), or diarrhea (/English/health

## issues/conditions/abdominal/Pages/Diarrhea.aspx) while teething, consult your pediatrician (/English/health

## issues/conditions/fever/Pages/When-to-Call-the-Pediatrician.aspx) to find out whether she has a medical 

## condition requiring treatment. 

## Keep Usual Bedtime Routine: 

## If your teething baby is irritable, try to make her comfortable, but keep to your usual bedtime routine. Changing the 

## routine, even for a few nights, may only lead to sleep troubles.
