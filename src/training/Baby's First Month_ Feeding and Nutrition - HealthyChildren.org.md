# Baby's First Month: Feeding and Nutrition 

## Your new baby's nutritional needs are greater than at 

## any other time in their life. Feeding your infant 

## provides more than just good nutrition, though. It also 

## allows you to hold your newborn close, cuddle, and 

## make eye contact. These are relaxing and enjoyable 

## moments for you both, bringing you closer together. 

## Because of its nutritional composition and health

## promoting properties, breast milk (also referred to as 

## human milk) is the ideal food for human infants. With 

## support, most women are able to successfully 

## breastfeed their babies. If you are unable to breastfeed, 

## infant formula is an acceptable and nutritious 

## alternative to breast milk. 

## Breastmilk or formula should be your child's sole nutritional source for the first six months. When you add solid 

## foods to your baby's diet, continue breastfeeding until at least 12 months or longer. 

## During this time, you and your pediatrician will need to pay attention to her pattern of feedings and make sure that 

## she's getting enough for growth. ( See, "How Often and How Much Should Your Baby Eat? (/English/ages

## stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/how-often-and-how-much-should-your-baby-eat.aspx) ") Regular checkups 

## (/English/ages-stages/Your-Childs-Checkups/Pages/default.aspx) and monitoring of growth is the best way to ensure 

## this. 

## Getting to know your baby's feeding patterns 

## Each baby has a particular style of feeding. Years ago researchers at Yale University playfully attached names to five 

## common eating patterns. See if you recognize your baby's dining behavior among them. 

## Barracudas get right down to business. As soon as they're put to the breast, they grasp the areola and suck 

## energetically for ten to twenty minutes. They usually become less eager as time goes on. 

## Excited ineffectives nursers become frantic at the sight of the breast. In a frenzied cycle they grasp it, lose it, and 

## start screaming in frustration. They must be calmed down several times during each feeding. The key to 

## nourishing this type of baby is to feed them as soon as they wake up, before they get desperately hungry. Also, if 

## the milk tends to spray from the breast as the baby struggles, it may help to manually express a few drops first to 

## slow the stream. 

## Procrastinators can't be bothered with nursing until the milk supply increases, commonly referred to as 

## "coming in." These babies shouldn't be given bottles of water or formula, as feeding them bottles may make it 

## more difficult to get them to nurse at the breast. You should continue to put them to the breast regularly, 

## whenever they appear alert or make mouthing movements. 

## Reluctant nursers sometimes benefit from being placed naked on the reclining mother's bare abdomen and 

## chest for a period of time. They may spontaneously move toward the breast, or they can be placed on the breast 

## after a time. You may find advice on improved positioning and attachment from a lactation specialist helpful. For 

## a baby who resists nursing for the first few days, you can use an electric pump between feedings to stimulate 

## milk production. Just don't give up! Contact your pediatrician's office for assistance or referral to a lactation 

## specialist. 

## Gourmets or mouthers insist on playing with the nipple, tasting the milk first and smacking their lips before 

## digging in. If hurried or prodded, they become furious and scream in protest. The best solution is tolerance. After 

## a few minutes of playing, they do settle down and nurse well. Just be sure the lips and gums are on the areola and

### not on the nipple. 

### Resters prefer to nurse for a few minutes, rest a few minutes, and resume nursing. Some fall asleep on the 

### breast, nap for half an hour or so, and then awaken ready for dessert. This pattern can be confusing, but these 

### babies cannot be hurried. The solution? It's best just to schedule extra time for feedings and remain as flexible as 

### possible. 

## Remember 

### Learning your own baby's eating patterns is one of your biggest challenges in the weeks after delivery. Once you 

### understand their patterns, you'll find it much easier to determine when they are hungry, when they have had enough, 

### how often they need to eat, and how much time is required for feedings. It is generally best to initiate a feeding at the 

### earliest signs of hunger, before the baby cries. Babies also have unique positions that they prefer. 

### Talk with your pediatrician if you have any questions or concerns about your baby's feeding and nutritional need.
