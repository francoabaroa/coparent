# Newborn Hearing Screening FAQs 

## Before you bring your newborn home from the hospital, your baby 

## needs to have a hearing screening 

## (https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/hearingloss/screening.html). 

## From birth, one important way babies can learn is through listening 

## and hearing. Although most infants can hear fine, 1 to 3 of every 

## 1,000 babies born in the U.S. have hearing levels outside the typical 

## range. 

## Newborn screening and diagnosis helps ensure all babies who are 

## deaf or hard of hearing are identified as soon as possible. Then, they 

## can receive early intervention services that can make a big 

## difference in their communication and language development. 

## The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends hearing screenings for all newborns. The goal is for 

## all babies to have a newborn hearing screening by one month of age, ideally before they go home from the hospital; 

## identified by 3 months of age and enrolled in early intervention or treatment, if identified as deaf or hard of hearing, 

## by the age of 6 months. 

## Why do newborns need hearing screening? 

## The hearing screening is a first and important step in helping understand if your baby may be deaf or hard of hearing. 

## Without newborn hearing screening, it is hard to know when there are hearing changes in the first months and years 

## of your baby's life. 

## Babies may respond to noise by startling or turning their heads toward the sound, for example. But this doesn't 

## necessarily mean they can hear all the sounds around them and everything we say. Babies who are deaf or hard of 

## hearing may hear some sounds but still not hear enough to understand spoken language. 

## Infants who are deaf or hard of hearing need the right supports, care, and early intervention services to promote 

## healthy development. If the hearing status is not identified, it may have negative effects on the baby's communication 

## and language skills. Longer term, a missed hearing loss can also impact the child's academic achievement and social

## emotional development. 

## How is the newborn hearing screening done? 

## According to the most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data, over 98% of newborns in the 

## United States receive newborn hearing screening. 

## There are two screening methods that may be used: 

## Automated Auditory Brainstem Response (AABR) —This 

## screen measures how the hearing nerve and brain respond to 

## sound. Clicks or tones are played through soft earphones into 

## the baby's ears. Three electrodes placed on the baby's head 

## measure the hearing nerve and brain's response. 

## Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE) —This screen measures sound 

## waves produced in the inner ear. A tiny probe is placed just 

## inside the baby's ear canal. It measures the response (echo) 

## when clicks or tones are played into the baby's ears. 


#### Both screens are quick (about 5 to 10 minutes), painless, and may be 

#### done while your baby is sleeping or lying still. One or both screens 

#### may be used. 

## What if my baby does not pass the 

## initial hearing screening? 

#### If your baby does not pass the hearing screening at birth, it does not 

#### necessarily mean that she is deaf or hard of hearing. Fluid or vernix 

#### (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/How-Your-Newborn-Looks.aspx) 

#### inside the baby's ear, for example, or too much noise in the room can 

#### affect results. In fact, most babies who do not pass the newborn screening have typical hearing. But to be sure, it is 

#### extremely important to have further testing done. 

#### About 1 or 2 in every 100 babies will not pass the initial hearing screening at birth and will need tests with 

#### an audiologist who has experience working with babies. This testing should include a more thorough hearing and 

#### medical evaluation. 

#### Be sure to talk with your baby's pediatrician about scheduling further tests if your baby does not pass the initial 

#### hearing screening at birth. The additional testing should be done as soon as possible, but before your baby is 3 

#### months old. 

#### Follow-up testing may start with one more screening similar to the type done in the hospital. Some hospitals or clinics 

#### may complete a diagnostic test at the time of follow-up, instead of re-screening. In young infants, the follow-up testing 

#### may be able to be completed while the baby naps. 

## If my baby is identified as deaf or hard of hearing, what are the 

## treatment and intervention options? 

#### If your baby's audiologist confirms hearing changes, treatment and early intervention (/English/health

#### issues/conditions/developmental-disabilities/Pages/Early-Intervention.aspx) with a team of providers should start as 

#### soon as possible. Just like hearing children, children who are deaf or hard of hearing can achieve many things. Studies 

#### (https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/hearingloss/features/feature-vocabulary-hearingloss.html) show your baby will have 

#### the best chance for spoken language development―on par with that of hearing peers―if any hearing changes are 

#### discovered, and support and intervention begins by 6 months of age. The earlier, the better. 

#### In addition to your pediatrician and audiologist, every baby who is deaf or hard of hearing should be seen by a 

#### pediatric otolaryngologist (/English/family-life/health-management/pediatric-specialists/Pages/What-is-a-Pediatric

#### Otolaryngologist.aspx) who specializes in the mechanics of the ear. Your pediatrician should also recommend seeing a 

#### pediatric ophthalmologist (/English/family-life/health-management/pediatric-specialists/Pages/What-is-a-Pediatric

#### Ophthalmologist.aspx), because some children can also have problems with their vision, and children who are deaf or 

#### hard of hearing are dependent on their vision for language input. Many children are also seen by a geneticist 

#### (https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/hearingloss/genetics.html) to determine if there is a hereditary cause of hearing 

#### changes. 

#### Your state Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) program 

#### (https://www.infanthearing.org/states/index.html) can help provide you and your pediatrician with more information. 

#### Babies who are deaf or hard of hearing should be referred to Early Intervention for evaluation and services. 

#### Additionally, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) (/English/health

#### issues/conditions/adhd/Pages/Section-504-and-IDEA-Coverage.aspx) supports intervention programs for children 

#### who are deaf or hard of hearing within early intervention and school programming. 

#### The audiologist, together with the otolaryngologist, can tell you the type and degree of hearing change 

#### (https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/hearingloss/types.html) and what the next steps are. These next steps can vary 

#### depending on your family's choices, as well as the type and degree of hearing change. 

## If my baby passes the newborn hearing screening, does it mean he or 

## she will not have hearing loss later? 

#### Unfortunately, no. Some babies may develop hearing loss later in childhood (https://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy

#### and-policy/aap-health-initiatives/pehdic/documents/signsoflateonsethl.pdf). Causes of late onset or progressive 

#### hearing loss in children can include genetics, frequent ear infections (/English/health-issues/conditions/ear-nose

#### throat/Pages/Ear-Infection-Information.aspx), other infections like measles (/English/health-issues/vaccine

##### Back to Top 


#### preventable-diseases/Pages/Measles.aspx) or meningitis (/English/health-issues/conditions/head-neck-nervous

#### system/Pages/Meningitis.aspx), a head injury, exposure to damaging levels of loud noises 

#### (https://www.noisyplanet.nidcd.nih.gov/), and secondhand smoke (/English/health

#### issues/conditions/tobacco/Pages/Smoking-Hurts-Everyone.aspx). Newborns who need an extended period of 

#### neonatal intensive care may also be at an increased risk for hearing loss later. 

### Even if your baby passes the newborn hearing screening, you should still watch 

### for possible signs of hearing loss as your child grows. Talk with your pediatrician 

### if your child: 

#### Doesn't startle at loud noises by 1 month or turn toward sounds by 3-4 months of age. 

#### Doesn't notice you until he sees you. 

#### Concentrates on vibrating noises more than other types of sounds. 

#### Doesn't seem to enjoy being read to. 

#### Is slow to begin talking, hard to understand, or doesn't say single words such as "dada" or "mama" by 12 to 15 

#### months of age. 

#### Doesn't always respond when called, especially from another room. 

#### Seems to hear some sounds but not others. (Some hearing loss affects only high-pitched sounds; some children 

#### have hearing loss in only one ear.) 

#### Has trouble holding his or her head steady or is slow to sit or walk unsupported. (In some children with 

#### sensorineural hearing loss, the part of the inner ear that provides information about balance and movement of 

#### the head is also damaged.) 

#### Wants the TV volume louder than other members of the family. 

## If my baby passes the first hearing test, why is more screening 

## needed? 

#### Even if your child shows no signs of hearing changes, the AAP recommends they be screened again at ages 4, 5, 6, 8 

#### and 10. Additional screenings are recommended sometime between ages 11-14, 15-17, and 18-21--or any time there is a 

#### concern. More frequent follow-up screenings may be recommended for children who have a higher risk for hearing 

#### loss. Hearing loss sometimes is gradual and hard to notice at first. Routine screenings can catch hearing 

#### changes early, when providing support and resources can have the most impact on the child's development. 

## Remember: 

#### Timing is everything. The sooner hearing changes are identified in a baby, the more likely interventions can help her 

#### reach her full potential. Talk with your pediatrician if you have any concerns about your child's hearing.
