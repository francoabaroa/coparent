# Improving Access to Healthy Foods 

## Access to Grocery Stores vs. Convenience Stores 

## Did you know access to large grocery stores increases fruit and vegetable (/English/healthy

## living/nutrition/Pages/How-to-Get-Your-Child-to-Eat-More-Fruits-and-Veggies.aspx) intake, 

## whereas access to convenience stores decreases intake? Low income, minority, and rural 

## neighborhoods have less access to supermarkets and healthful food but have increased access to 

## convenience stores and the nutrient-poor, high-calorie foods that are often found in these food 

## outlets. 

## In a study of neighborhoods in Detroit, increased access to supermarkets increased adult fruit and vegetable servings 

## by 0.69 servings per day. White, black, and Hispanic adults all consumed more servings of fruits and vegetables when 

## a large grocery store was present in their neighborhood, with the highest increase for Hispanic adults. Convenience 

## stores significantly decreased fruit and vegetable intake among Hispanic adults. 

## Innovative Food Programs to Improve Access to Healthy Food 

## As the importance of access to healthy food is increasingly recognized, innovative food programs are gaining in 

## popularity. Community gardens, suburban farms, and collaborations between backyard vegetable gardens and local 

## food banks all offer ideas for solutions for inadequate access to fresh fruits and vegetables. City and state land use 

## policies can affect the success of these types of programs. The ultimate effect of these programs on children's health, 

## particularly in vulnerable populations, remains to be seen.
