# The "Perfect" Family 

## Is there such a thing as a "perfect" family? 

## The American family is a rapidly changing institution. You may have grown up in the stereotypical American family 

## two parents and one or more children, with a father who worked outside the home and a mother who stayed home and 

## cared for the children and the household. Today, with the entry of so many more women into the workforce, with the 

## increasing divorce rate, and with the growing number of single-parent households, other family structures have 

## become more common. 

## If your own family is not like the one you grew up in, your situation is certainly not unusual. Currently, 30 percent of 

## American families are now headed by single parents, either divorced, widowed, or never married. Some children live 

## in foster families; others live in step-families or in gay and lesbian families. In more than two thirds of families, both 

## parents work outside the home. 

## Even if your own family fits the more traditional mold, your children will almost certainly have some friends who live 

## in households with different structures. From time to time you can expect your youngsters to ask questions like "Why 

## do people get divorced?" "How come Jimmy's mother and father don't live together?" "Why does Annette's father live 

## with another lady?" Because families are so important to children, parents need to be able to answer such questions 

## with more than mere slogans or quick replies. By asking these questions, children are trying to understand two things 

## about families: the different structures that families can take and the changes in structure, lifestyles and relationships 

## that can occur. 

## Any group of people living together in a household can create and call themselves a family. For example, to share 

## expenses a divorced mother with two children may live with another divorced woman with children; together, they 

## may consider themselves a family. A grandparent who lives with her daughter, son-in-law, and grandchildren may 

## become an integral part of their family. The variations of family structures and definition are almost endless, but they 

## have certain qualities in common: Family members share their lives emotionally and together fulfill the multiple 

## responsibilities of family life. 

## MYTH: The "Nuclear Family" Is A Universal Phenomenon 

## The nuclear family is generally defined as a family group made up of only a father, mother, and children. Although 

## most people tend to think that this particular family structure has always been the dominant one, that is not the case. 

## The nuclear family is a relatively recent phenomenon, becoming common only within the last century. Before then, 

## the "traditional" family was multigenerational, with grandparents often living with their children on farms as well as in 

## urban environments, typically with other relatives living nearby. The nuclear family has evolved in response to a 

## number of factors: better health and longer lives, economic development, industrialization, urbanization, geographic 

## mobility, and migration to the suburbs. These changes have resulted in physical separation of extended-family 

## members and in progressive fragmentation of the family. 

## MYTH: Family Harmony Is The Rule, Not The Exception 

## Although family life is often romanticized, it has always been filled with conflicts (/English/family-life/family

## dynamics/pages/Family-Arguments.aspx) and tension. Difficulties between spouses are commonplace, with 

## disagreements arising over issues ranging from how the children should be raised to how the family finances should 

## be budgeted. Husbands and wives also often struggle with their inability to sustain romantic infatuation beyond the 

## first few years of their marriage, thus having to learn to maintain a relationship in which partnership and 

## companionship may become more important than passionate love. 

## Parent-children conflicts are commonplace too. As parents assert their authority, and children try to assert their 

## autonomy appropriately, strife is inevitable.

### While we often expect families to be above the chaos that exists in the rest of society, that outlook places unrealistic 

### expectations upon the family. In the real world, families are not always a haven, since they, too, can be filled with 

### conflict. Although stress and disagreements are common, they can be destructive to families, especially when conflict 

### gets out of hand. Families are under constant stress, being pushed and pulled from many directions, often without the 

### support systems of extended families that may have existed in the past. 

## MYTH: The Stability of A Family Is A Measure of Its Success 

### Change is a part of life. Death (/English/healthy-living/emotional-wellness/pages/A-Childs-Reaction-to-Death.aspx), 

### illness, physical separation, financial strains, divorce (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/types-of

### families/pages/Divorce-What-Should-You-Tell-the-Children.aspx)... these are some of the events families have to 

### adjust to. Consequently, stability shouldn't be the only measure of a family's success. Many families function quite 

### well, despite frequent disruptions. In fact, one important measure of a family's success is its ability to adjust to change. 

### Daily life is full of stresses that constantly demand accommodation from family members. 

## MYTH: Parents Control Their Children's Fate 

### In reality, parents cannot determine how their children will turn out. Inevitably, children assert their autonomy, 

### creating a niche for themselves separate from their parents. At the same time, many factors external to both the child 

### and family can influence the way a child develops. 

### Even within the same family there can be tremendous individual variations among siblings in intelligence, 

### temperament, mood, and sociability. Yet despite these differences, parents are responsible for imparting to each child 

### a sense of being loved and accepted, for helping each child to succeed at various developmental tasks, and for 

### socializing each child into respecting the rules and accepting the responsibilities society imposes. These are indeed 

### awesome tasks. 

### Some parents perceive themselves as having total responsibility for their children's fate. This belief places a heavy 

### and unrealistic emotional burden on them as well as their youngsters. If the children are having problems, they often 

### feel a sense of failure; likewise, the children feel as though they have let their family down if they do not live up to 

### their parents' expectations. In essence, parents can influence and shape but cannot control their children's lives.
