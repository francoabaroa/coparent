# Gastroesophageal Reflux & Gastroesophageal Reflux 

# Disease: Parent FAQs 

## By: Anthony Porto, MD, MPH, FAAP 

## All babies spit up (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding

## nutrition/Pages/Burping-Hiccups-and-Spitting-Up.aspx)— and it 

## often seems like everything they just ate comes right back up! 

## So, how do you know if your spitty baby's symptoms are normal or 

## part of a larger problem? 

## To help you sort it all out, the American Academy of Pediatrics 

## (AAP) answers common questions about typical digestive 

## functioning and explains the differences between 

## gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and gastroesophageal reflux 

## disease (GERD). 

## What are the differences between GER and GERD? 

## Without getting too technical, spit-up (also called reflux, gastroesophageal reflux, or GER) is the movement of 

## stomach contents into the esophagus, and sometimes through the mouth and nose. When reflux is associated with 

## other symptoms, or if it persists beyond infancy, it is considered a disease and is known as gastroesophageal reflux 

## disease or GERD. 

## GER in infants is not considered a disease and does not include a "D." In fact, GER is considered normal. These infants 

## are known as "happy spitters," because they are not cranky and do not appear to be in a great deal of pain when 

## spitting up. In fact, your baby may feel better after a good spit-up. Other symptoms of GER include mild feeding 

## problems, such as occasional prolonged feeds or interrupted feeds. 

## When is spit-up or GER normal? 

## GER usually begins at approximately 2 to 3 weeks of life and peaks between 4 to 5 months. Most babies who are born at 

## full term will have complete resolution of symptoms by the time they are 9 to 12 months old. 

## In most babies, GER disappears as the upper digestive tract functionally matures. In addition, normal development, 

## including improved head control and being able to sit up, as well as the introduction of solid food (/English/ages

## stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Starting-Solid-Foods.aspx), will help improve GER symptoms. 

## What are the causes of GER? 

## If your baby's stomach is full or his or her position is changed abruptly, especially after a feeding, the stomach 

## contents—food mixed with stomach acid—press against the valve at the top of the stomach. This is called the lower 

## esophageal sphincter. This ring of muscle normally relaxes to let food pass from the esophagus into the stomach and 

## then tightens again to keep the food there. When it is not fully developed or it opens at the wrong time, the stomach 

## contents move back or reflux into the esophagus. See Why Babies Spit Up (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding

## nutrition/Pages/Why-Babies-Spit-Up.aspx) for more information on this. 

## In older children, diet can play more of a role. Large meals and highly acidic or spicy meals, as well as carbonated or 

## caffeinated beverages, can lead to increased GER symptoms. In addition, GER is more common in children who are 

## overweight or obese. 

## How do I know if my child has GERD? 

## Unlike GER, GERD is associated with complications from acid reflux. Call your pediatrician if your child exhibits any of 

## the following signs or symptoms: 


##### Refusal to feed 

##### Crying and/or arching the back during feeds (i.e., seems to be in pain) 

##### Blood or greenish color in the spit-up 

##### Increase in frequency or intensity of the spit-up (i.e., forceful) 

##### Belly is swollen or distended or feels hard 

##### Respiratory symptoms—including wheezing and coughing 

##### In addition, let your pediatrician know if you notice that your baby doesn't seem to be gaining weight or is having 

##### fewer wet and dirty diapers, as these may be signs that not enough of what he or she eats is staying down. 

## How will my pediatrician evaluate my baby for GER? 

##### The AAP believes it is important for all pediatric health care providers to be able to properly identify and treat 

##### children with reflux symptoms, and to distinguish GER from more worrisome disorders to avoid unnecessary costs 

##### and treatments. 

##### Your child's pediatrician will review your child's symptoms and feeding patterns and assess your child's growth by 

##### plotting his or her weight and height on a growth chart (/English/health-issues/conditions/Glands-Growth

##### Disorders/Pages/Growth-Charts-By-the-Numbers.aspx). This information will help them determine whether your 

##### child is a "happy spitter" or has symptoms of GERD. 

## How is GER or GERD treated? 

##### While we wish we had a "quick fix" for babies who spit up, the truth is that for a good many spitty babies, it is mostly a 

##### matter of time. Lifestyle changes—including feeding and/or position changes—are recommended as first-line 

##### therapy for both GER and GERD. If GERD is severe, treatment may include medication or surgery. The surgery to 

#### correct reflux is called fundoplication. 

### Treatment options during infancy: 

##### Burp at natural pauses in feeding and keeping your child upright for up to thirty minutes after feeding. If 

##### your bottle-fed baby spits up unusually often, your pediatrician may recommend thickening his or her 

##### formula with a very small amount of baby cereal. Never add solids to the bottle unless your pediatrician 

#### advises it. S ee Oatmeal: The Safer Alternative for Infants & Children Who Need Thicker Food 

##### (/English/health-issues/conditions/abdominal/Pages/Oatmeal-The-Safer-Alternative-Need-Thicker

#### Food.aspx) for more information on this line of treatment. 

##### Consider smaller and more frequent feedings, but be sure your baby is taking in enough to keep up typical 

##### growth and development. 

##### Consider keeping your baby in an upright position for the first half hour or so after feeding. Always closely 

##### supervise your baby during this time. 

##### Regardless of whether or not your baby warrants watchful waiting or medical intervention, the AAP does 

#### have additional and simple feeding suggestions that can help you deal with the situation at hand. See 

#### Remedies for Spitty Babies (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Remedies-for-Spitty

#### Babies.aspx) for more treatment tips. 

### Treatment options for an older child: 

##### Avoid fried and fatty foods; they slow down the rate of the stomach emptying and promote reflux. 

##### Peppermint, caffeine (/English/ages-stages/teen/nutrition/Pages/Hidden-Caffeine.aspx), and certain 

##### asthma medications (/English/health-issues/conditions/allergies-asthma/Pages/Medications-Used-to

##### Treat-Asthma.aspx) can make the lower esophageal sphincter relax and allow stomach contents to reflux 

##### back into the esophagus. Some experts believe that tomato-based products have a similar effect. If any food 

##### seems to produce reflux or heartburn, keep it out of the diet for a week or two and then reintroduce it. If 

##### symptoms reoccur, avoid that food until your pediatrician recommends to reintroduce it into the diet. 

##### Sometimes your pediatrician may recommend medications that neutralize or decrease the acid in your 

##### child's stomach to treat symptoms associated with GERD.

## When might my pediatrician refer my child to a pediatric 

## gastroenterologist? 

##### Your pediatrician may refer your child to see a pediatric gastroenterologist (/English/family-life/health

##### management/pediatric-specialists/Pages/What-is-a-Pediatric-Gastroenterologist.aspx), a pediatrician who has 

##### specialized training in problems of the gastrointestinal tract—including GERD—for a variety of reasons including: 

##### Poor weight gain 

##### Feeding problems 

##### No response to medical therapy 

##### A pediatric gastroenterologist will review your child's history, examine your child and review his or her diet history 

##### and growth charts. Sometimes, it can be helpful for a pediatric gastroenterologist to observe your child being fed or 

##### self-feeding. Based on the visit, he or she will decide whether your child may benefit from additional testing or from 

##### the addition of or a change in medications.
