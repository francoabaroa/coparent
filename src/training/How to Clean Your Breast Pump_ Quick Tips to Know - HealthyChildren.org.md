# How to Clean Your Breast Pump: Quick Tips to Know 

## Providing breast milk is one of the best things you can do for your 

## baby's health and development. Pumping your milk is one way to 

## provide breast milk to your baby. However, germs can grow quickly 

## in breast milk or breast milk residue that remains on pump parts. 

## Following these steps can keep your breast pump clean and 

## help protect your baby from these germs. 

## Note: If your baby was born prematurely or has other health 

## concerns, your baby's health care providers may have more 

## recommendations for pumping breast milk safely. See Providing 

## Breastmilk for Premature and Ill Newborns (/English/ages

## stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Providing-Breastmilk-for

## Premature-and-Ill-Newborns.aspx) for more information. 

## Before Each Use: 

## Wash hands. Wash your hands (/English/health-issues/conditions/prevention/Pages/Hand-Washing-A

## Powerful-Antidote-to-Illness.aspx) well with soap and water for 20 seconds. 

## Assemble. Assemble clean pump kit. Inspect whether the pump kit or tubing has become moldy or soiled during 

## storage. If your tubing is moldy, discard and replace immediately. 

## Clean if using a shared pump. Clean pump dials, power switch, and countertop with disinfectant wipe. 

## After Every Use: 

## Store milk safely. Cap milk collection bottle or seal milk collection bag, label with date and time, and 

## immediately place in a refrigerator, freezer, or cooler bag with ice packs. 

## If milk collection container will be stored at a hospital or child care facility, add name to the label. 

## Clean pumping area. Especially if using a shared pump, clean the dials, power switch, and countertop with 

## disinfectant wipes. 

## Take apart and inspect pump kit. Take apart breast pump tubing and separate all parts that come in contact 

## with breast/breast milk (for example, flanges, valves, membranes, connectors, and milk collection bottles). 

## Rinse pump kit. Rinse breast pump parts that come into contact with breast/breast milk under running water to 

## remove remaining milk 

## Clean pump kit. As soon as possible after pumping, clean pump parts that come into contact with breast/breast 

## milk in one of the following ways. 

## Clean by hand. 

## Use a wash basin. Place pump parts in a clean wash basin used only for washing infant feeding 

## equipment. Do not place pump parts directly in the sink, because germs in sinks or drains could 

## contaminate the pump. 

## Add soap and water. Fill wash basin with hot water and add soap. 

## Scrub. Scrub items using a clean brush that is used only to clean infant feeding items. 


#### Rinse. Rinse by holding items under running water, or by submerging in fresh water in a separate 

#### basin that is used only for cleaning infant feeding items. 

#### Dry. Allow to air-dry thoroughly. Place pump parts, wash basin, and bottle brush on a clean, unused dish 

#### towel or paper towel in an area protected from dirt and dust. Do not use a dish towel to rub or pat items 

#### dry because doing so may transfer germs to the items. 

### Clean in a dishwasher (if recommended by pump kit manufacturer). 

#### Wash. Place disassembled pump parts in dishwasher. Be sure to place small 

#### items into a closed-top basket or mesh laundry bag so they don't end up in the 

#### dishwasher filter. If possible, run the dishwasher using hot water and a heated 

#### drying cycle (or sanitizing setting); this can help kill more germs. 

#### Remove from dishwasher. Wash your hands with soap and water before removing and storing cleaned 

#### items. If items are not completely dry, place items on a clean, unused dish towel or paper towel to air

#### dry thoroughly before storing. Do not use a dish towel to rub or pat items dry because doing so may 

#### transfer germs to the items. 

#### Clean wash basin and bottle brush. If you use a wash basin or bottle brush when cleaning your pump parts, 

#### rinse them well and allow them to air-dry after each use. Consider washing them every few days, either in a 

#### dishwasher with hot water and a heated drying cycle if they are dishwasher-safe, or by hand with soap and warm 

#### water. 

## Tips for Handling Breast Pump Tubing: 

#### When used correctly, breast pump tubing does not touch the pumped milk and does not need to be cleaned 

#### routinely. 

#### Keep a spare set of tubing on hand in case the set you are using gets soiled or damaged. 

#### If your tubing has water droplets in it at the end of a pumping session, disconnect the tubing from the 

#### flange/pump kit, but leave it attached to the pump. Run the pump for a few more minutes until the tubing is dry. 

#### If your tubing has milk or mold in it, throw it away immediately because it is difficult to clean properly. Replace it 

#### with a new set of tubing, and check to see if the problem happened because 

#### The valves or membranes need to be replaced. 

#### The tubing was attached to the pump incorrectly. 

#### If the outside of your tubing is soiled, wipe it with a damp cloth or disinfectant wipe. 

## For Extra Protection, Sanitize: 

#### For extra germ removal, sanitize pump parts at least once daily. Sanitizing is especially important if your baby is less 

#### than 3 months old, was born prematurely, or has a weakened immune system due to illness or medical treatment 

#### (such as chemotherapy for cancer). Daily sanitizing of pump parts may not be necessary for older, healthy babies, if the 

#### parts are cleaned carefully after each use. Sanitize all items (even the bottle brush and wash basin!) by using one of the 

#### following options. 

### Note: If you use a dishwasher with hot water and a heating drying cycle (or sanitizing setting) to clean infant feeding 

### items, a separate sanitizing step is not necessary. 

#### Clean first. Pump parts, bottle brushes, and wash basins should be sanitized only after they have been cleaned. 

#### Sanitize. Sanitize the pump kit, bottle brushes, and wash basins using one of the following options. Check 

#### manufacturer's instructions about whether items may be steamed or boiled. 

#### Steam. Use a microwave or plug-in steam system according to the manufacturer's directions. 

#### Boil. 

#### Place disassembled items that are safe to boil into a pot and cover with water. 

#### Put the pot over heat and bring to a boil. 

#### Boil for 5 minutes.

#### Remove items with clean tongs. 

#### Allow to air-dry thoroughly. Place sanitized pump parts, wash basin, and bottle brush on a clean, unused dish 

#### towel or paper towel in an area protected from dirt and dust. Do not use a dish towel to rub or pat items dry 

#### because doing so may transfer germs to the items. 

## Store Safely Until Needed: 

#### Allow the clean pump parts, bottle brushes, and wash basins to air-dry thoroughly before storing to help prevent 

#### germs and mold from growing. Once completely dry, the items should be stored in a clean, protected area to prevent 

#### contamination during storage. 

#### Wash hands. Wash hands well with soap and water. 

#### Reassemble. Put together the clean, dry pump parts. 

#### Store safely. Place reassembled pump kit in a clean, protected area such as inside an unused, sealable food 

#### storage bag. Store wash basins and bottle brushes in a clean area.
