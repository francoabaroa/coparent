# The Importance of Family Routines 

## Every family needs routines. They help to organize life and keep it 

## from becoming too chaotic. Children do best when routines are 

## regular, predictable, and consistent. 

## One of a family's greatest challenges is to establish comfortable, 

## effective routines, which should achieve a happy compromise 

## between the disorder and confusion that can occur without them 

## and the rigidity and boredom that can come with too much 

## structure and regimentation, where children are given no choice 

## and little flexibility. 

## As a parent, review the routines in your household to ensure 

## that they accomplish what you want. Here are some tips from 

## the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). 

## Weekday Mornings: 

## To make the household function well in the morning, everyone needs to know what has to be done to get ready for the 

## day. Try the following: 

## Put as many things in order as possible the night before. 

## Keep wake-up routines cheerful and positive. 

## Be sure your child eats breakfast, even if he or she is not hungry in the morning. See Breakfast for Learning 

## (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Breakfast-for-Learning.aspx). 

## Finally, round out each morning by saying goodbye to your young child. A simple hug and a wave as he or she 

## heads out the front door or slides out of the car are extremely important. They will give your child a positive 

## feeling with which to begin the day's activities. See How to Ease Your Child's Separation Anxiety (/English/ages

## stages/toddler/Pages/Soothing-Your-Childs-Separation-Anxiety.aspx). 

## After School: 

## During middle childhood, children need adult supervision. While some parents have their children return each 

## afternoon to an empty home, these "latchkey" kids (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/Staying-Safe-At

## Home-Latchkey-Kids.aspx) are more susceptible to misbehavior, risk-taking, and anxiety. For this age group, the 

## AAP recommends that a child come home to a parent, other adult, or a responsible adolescent. 

## Evenings: 

## Dinner should be an important time for your family. As often as possible, all family members should eat together at 

## the dinner table, without the distraction of television (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/Food-and-TV-Not-a-Healthy

## Mix.aspx) or radio. During dinner the family can share the day's activities and participate in enjoyable conversation. 

## Everyone should be encouraged to take part, and negative comments and criticism should be discouraged. 

## Bedtime: 

## On school nights, children need a regular time to go to sleep. Lights can go out at different times for different children 

## in the family, depending on how much sleep each child needs. Nighttime rituals can help ease a child to sleep. These 

## rituals can include storytelling, reading aloud, conversation, and songs. Try to avoid exciting play and activities before 

## bedtime. See Brush, Book, Bed: How to Structure Your Child's Nighttime Routine (/English/healthy-living/oral

## health/Pages/Brush-Book-Bed.aspx).

## Weekends: 

### Weekends are good times for family togetherness. You might go grocery shopping as a family, visit museums and 

### zoos, do chores (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/communication-discipline/Pages/Chores-and

### Responsibility.aspx) that everyone participates in, go on hikes or bike rides (/English/safety-prevention/at

### play/Pages/bicycle-safety-myths-and-facts.aspx), or attend religious services. On weekends children in the middle 

### years can usually be allowed a later bedtime than during the week. Keep in mind that, although family time is 

### essential, it is equally important for parents to set aside some time just for themselves, too.
