# Language Delays in Toddlers: Information for Parents 

## Your baby is able to communicate with you long before 

## they speak a single word! A baby's cry, smile, and 

## responses to you help you to understand their needs. 

## Learn how children communicate and what to do when 

## there are concerns about delays in development. 

## Milestones during the first 2 

## years 

## Children develop at different rates, but they usually are 

## able to do certain things at certain ages. Following are 

## general developmental milestones (/English/ages

## stages/toddler/pages/Developmental-Milestones-2-Year-Olds.aspx). Keep in mind that they are only guidelines. If you 

## have any questions about your baby's development, ask your child's doctor—the sooner the better. Even when there 

## are delays, early intervention can make a significant difference. 

## By 1 year most babies will 

## Look for and be able to find where a sound is coming from. 

## Respond to their name most of the time when you call it. 

## Wave goodbye (/English/ages-stages/baby/pages/Hand-and-Finger-Skills.aspx). 

## Look where you point when you say, "Look at the _________." 

## Babble with intonation (voice rises and falls as if they are speaking in sentences). 

## Take turns "talking (/English/tips-tools/ask-the-pediatrician/Pages/one-year-old--Should-she-be-talking-by

## now.aspx)" with you—listen and pay attention to you when you speak and then resume babbling when you stop. 

## Say "da-da" to dad and "ma-ma" to mom. 

## Say at least 1 word. 

## Point to items they want that are out of reach or make sounds while pointing. 

## Between 1 and 2 years most toddlers will 

## Follow simple commands, first when the adult speaks and gestures, and then later with words alone. 

## Get objects from another room when asked. 

## Point (/English/ages-stages/baby/pages/These-Hands-Were-Made-for-Talking.aspx) to a few body parts when 

## asked. 

## Point to interesting objects or events to get you to look at them too. 

## Bring things to you to show you. 

## Point to objects so you will name them. 

## Name a few common objects and pictures when asked. 


##### Enjoy pretending (for example, pretend cooking). They will use gestures and words with you or with a favorite 

##### stuffed animal or doll. 

##### Learn about 1 new word (/English/ages-stages/toddler/pages/Language-Development-1-Year-Olds.aspx) per 

##### week between 11/2 and 2 years. 

### By 2 years of age most toddlers will 

##### Point (/English/ages-stages/toddler/pages/Hand-and-Finger-Skills-2-Year-Olds.aspx) to many body parts and 

##### common objects. 

##### Point to some pictures in books. 

##### Follow 1-step commands without a gesture like "Put your cup on the table." 

##### Be able to say (/English/ages-stages/toddler/pages/Language-Development-2-Year-Olds.aspx)about 50 to 100 

##### words. 

##### Say several 2-word phrases like "Daddy go," "Doll mine," and "All gone." 

##### Perhaps say a few 3-word sentences like "I want juice" or "You go bye-bye." 

##### Be understood by others (or by adults) about half of the time. 

## When milestones are delayed 

##### If your child's development seems delayed or shows any of the behaviors in the following list, tell your child's doctor. 

##### Sometimes language delays occur along with these behaviors. Also, tell your child's doctor if your baby stops talking 

##### or doing things that he or she used to do. 

##### Doesn't cuddle like other babies 

##### Doesn't return a happy smile back to you 

##### Doesn't seem to notice if you are in the room 

##### Doesn't seem to notice certain noises (for example, seems to hear a car horn or a cat's meow but not when you 

##### call his or her name) 

##### Acts as if he or she is in his or her own world 

##### Prefers to play alone; seems to "tune others out" 

##### Doesn't seem interested in or play with toys but likes to play with objects in the house 

##### Has intense interest in objects young children are not usually interested in (for example, would rather carry 

##### around a flashlight or ballpoint pen than a stuffed animal or favorite blanket) 

##### Can say the ABCs, numbers, or words to TV jingles but can't use words to ask for things he or she wants 

##### Doesn't seem to be afraid of anything 

##### Doesn't seem to feel pain in a typical fashion 

##### Uses words or phrases that are unusual for the situation or repeats scripts from TV 

## Delays in language 

##### Delays in language are the most common types of developmental delay. One out of 5 children will learn to talk or use 

##### words later than other children their age. Some children will also show behavioral problems because they are 

##### frustrated when they can't express what they need or want. 

##### Simple speech delays are sometimes temporary. They may resolve on their own or with a little extra help from family. 

##### It's important to encourage your child to "talk" to you with gestures or sounds and for you to spend lots of time playing 

##### with, reading to, and talking with your infant or toddler. In some cases, your child will need more help from a trained 

##### professional, a speech and language therapist, to learn to communicate.

##### Sometimes delays may be a warning sign of a more serious problem that could include hearing loss (/English/health

##### issues/conditions/developmental-disabilities/Pages/Hearing-Loss.aspx), developmental delay in other areas, or even 

##### an autism spectrum disorder (/English/health-issues/conditions/Autism/Pages/Early-Signs-of-Autism-Spectrum

##### Disorders.aspx) (ASD). Language delays in early childhood also could be a sign of a learning problem that may not be 

##### diagnosed until the school years. It's important to have your child evaluated if you are concerned about your child's 

##### language development. 

## What your child's doctor might do 

##### Sometimes more information is needed about your child before your child's doctor can address your concerns. The 

##### doctor may 

##### Ask you some questions or ask you to fill out a questionnaire. 

##### Interact with your child in various ways to learn more about his or her development. 

##### Order a hearing test and refer you to a speech and language therapist for testing. The therapist will evaluate your 

#### child's speech ( expressive language) and ability to understand speech and gestures ( receptive language). 

##### Refer your child for evaluation through an early intervention program. 

## What to expect after the doctor's visit 

##### If your child's doctor tells you not to worry (that your child will "catch up in time") but you are still concerned, it's OK to 

##### get a second opinion. You can ask your child's doctor for a referral to a developmental specialist (/English/family

##### life/health-management/pediatric-specialists/Pages/What-is-a-Developmental-Behavioral-Pediatrician.aspx) or a 

##### speech and language therapist. You may also contact an early intervention program for an evaluation if your child is 

#### younger than 3 years, or your local school district if he or she is 3 or older.If what your child says ( expressive language) 

##### is the only delay, you may be given suggestions to help your child at home. Formal speech therapy may also be 

##### recommended. 

#### If both what your child understands ( receptive language) and what he or she says are delayed and a hearing test is 

##### normal, your child will need further evaluation. This will determine whether the delays are caused by a true 

##### communication dis order, generalized developmental delays, an ASD, or another developmental problem. 

##### When an ASD is the reason for language delays, your child will also have difficulty interacting with other people and 

##### may show some or all of the concerning behaviors listed previously. If there is concern your child might have an ASD, 

##### your child will usually be referred to a specialist or a team of specialists for evaluation and treatment of an ASD or a 

##### related disorder. The specialist(s) may then recommend speech therapy and may suggest other ways to improve 

##### social skills, behavior, and the desire to communicate. 

## Programs that help children and families 

##### If your child has delays or suspected delays, your child's doctor will probably refer you to an early intervention 

##### program in your area. The staff there might do additional evaluations and reassure you that your child's development 

##### is normal or tell you that your child would benefit from some type of intervention. Your child does not need to have a 

##### diagnosis of a developmental problem to receive services through this program. 

##### If your child is younger than 3 years , the referral may be to an early intervention program in your area. Early 

##### intervention programs are sometimes called "Part C" or "Birth to Three" programs. Early intervention is a federaland 

##### state-funded program that helps children and their families. You may also contact the early intervention program 

##### yourself. 

#### If your child qualifies for services , a team of specialists will work with you to develop an Individual Family Service 

#### Plan (IFSP). This plan becomes a guide for the services your child will receive until 3 years of age. It may include 

##### parent training and support, direct therapy, and special equipment. Other services may be offered if they benefit your 

##### child and family. If your child needs help after 3 years of age, the early intervention staff will transition your child to 

##### services through your local school district. 

##### If your child is 3 years or older , the referral may be to your local public school. You may also contact the local public 

#### school directly. If your child is eligible, the school district staff will, with your input, develop an Individual Education 

#### Plan (IEP). This plan may provide some of the same services as the early intervention program but focus on school 

##### services for your child. The level of services also may be different. If your child continues to need special education 

##### and services, the IEP will be reviewed and revised from time to time.
