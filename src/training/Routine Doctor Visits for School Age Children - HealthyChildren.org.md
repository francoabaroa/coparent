# Routine Doctor Visits for School Age Children 

## During these doctor's visits, your physician (/English/tips-tools/find

## pediatrician/Pages/Pediatrician-Referral-Service.aspx) will conduct a number of evaluations, 

## such as measurement of height, weight, and blood pressure, a check of vital functions, a vision 

## and hearing screening, and a complete physical examination. The doctor will ensure that your 

## youngster's immunizations are up to date, and ask about your child's diet, exercise habits, and 

## sleep patterns. He or she can also refer you to other health professionals: For example, children 

## should receive regular dental checkups beginning at age three; if a pediatrician detects eye 

## problems during routine screening, he or she may refer your child to an ophthalmologist for 

## further evaluation and care. 

## Your pediatrician is interested not only in your child's physical health, but also in his or her mental and emotional 

## well-being. It is appropriate to discuss such concerns as your youngster's school experiences, relationships with peers, 

## family difficulties, and daily stresses. 

## During these middle years, also encourage your child to adopt good personal hygiene habits: bathing regularly; 

## routinely washing hands before eating and after going to the bathroom, as a way of preventing the spread of infectious 

## diseases; brushing teeth at least twice a day, and flossing once. 

## Through these preventive measures you can reduce your child's risk of illness and injury—and keep down your 

## medical expenses in the process.
