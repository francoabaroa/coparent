# Checkup Checklist: 9 Months Old 

## 9 months...you're becoming a pro at this! Your baby may be sitting up on their own and getting ready to crawl. Your 

## doctor can guide you through what to expect as they become more active and mobile. Here's what else you can expect 

## at this checkup: 

## ✅ Immunizations 

## At the 9-month visit, your baby may receive the final dose of the hepatitis B vaccine (/English/safety

## prevention/immunizations/Pages/Hepatitis-B-Vaccine-What-Parents-Need-to-Know.aspx) (HBV) and/or the third 

## dose of the inactivated polio vaccine (/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Polio-Vaccine-What-You

## Need-to-Know.aspx) (IPV) if they did not get those at the last checkup. 

## The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recommend the 

## seasonal influenza (/English/health-issues/conditions/chest-lungs/Pages/The-Flu.aspx) vaccine (flu shot) for children 

## 6 months of age and older as soon as it becomes available. So, if your pediatrician has the influenza vaccine available, 

## be sure to add that one to your checklist. 

## Note: Infants and children up to 8 years of age who are getting their flu shot for the first time may need two doses, 

## given at least four weeks apart. Be sure to follow up with your baby's second dose if they get their first one at this 

## appointment. 

## ✅ Screenings 

## Developmental screening: This may be a more formal developmental test than your baby had at past 

## appointments. Your pediatrician will ask you a series of questions about your baby's growth and behavior and 

## may ask you to play with your baby during the screening to observe. The results will show whether your baby is 

## developing at a normal rate or further testing for developmental delays 

## (/English/MotorDelay/Pages/default.aspx) are needed. If your baby is at a greater risk for developmental 

## problems because of preterm birth (/English/ages-stages/baby/preemie/Pages/default.aspx) or low birth weight 

## or has a sibling who has an autism spectrum disorder (ASD (/English/health

## issues/conditions/Autism/Pages/default.aspx)), they may receive these screenings more frequently. 

## Dental check: Your pediatrician may apply fluoride varnish (/English/healthy-living/oral

## health/Pages/Fluoride-Varnish-What-Parents-Need-to-Know.aspx) after your baby's first tooth appears. 

## ✅Feeding & development 

## Your pediatrician will measure and weigh your baby to make sure their growth is on track, observe their development 

## and behavior, and perform a physical exam. 

## Questions your pediatrician may ask 

## Do you have concerns about how your child sees (/English/health-issues/conditions/eyes/Pages/Warning-Signs

## of-Vison-Problems-in-Children.aspx) or hears? 

## What is your baby's nighttime routine (/English/healthy-living/oral-health/Pages/Brush-Book-Bed.aspx) like? 

## Can your baby pull to stand (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Movement-8-to-12-Months.aspx)? 

## Questions you may have 

## When should I discontinue the bottle (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Discontinuing-the

## Bottle.aspx)?

##### Are you taking any alone time for yourself? It isn't selfish—taking time for yourself makes you a better mom 

##### (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/Pages/How-Taking-Care-of-Yourself-Makes-you-a-Better-Mom.aspx)! 

##### Do you find yourself telling your baby "No!" (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/communication

#### hurt others.)
