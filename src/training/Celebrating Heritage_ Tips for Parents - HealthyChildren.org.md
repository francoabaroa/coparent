# Celebrating Heritage: Tips for Parents 

## Feeling good about our own ethnic traditions, 

## appearance, language, history and cultural 

## contributions is important. It's also important to honor 

## the diversity of people from all backgrounds and 

## traditions. You are your children's best role model 

## when it comes to teaching them about honoring 

## differences in others and celebrating the way in which 

## we all contribute to the world. 

## Helping children feel cultural & 

## ethnic pride 

## There are a lot of ways to encourage your child to feel a sense of pride and self-esteem in your family's culture and 

## appreciate cultural differences in others. Some tips: 

## Teach your children to feel proud of their heritage. Talk about your history and traditions in a positive light. 

## Educating your child about your ethnic history, including accomplishments, traditions and beliefs, provides your 

## child with internal strength. 

## Help your children find books, apps, and games with diverse characters. 

## Recommended Reading: Diverse & Inclusive Books for Children (/English/healthy-living/emotional

## wellness/Building-Resilience/Pages/diverse-and-inclusive-books-for-children.aspx) 

## Apps and Games with Diverse Characters (https://www.commonsensemedia.org/lists/apps-and-games

## with-diverse-characters) 

## Become involved in your children's school to ensure that your ethnicity, traditions, and customs are respected 

## and responded to appropriately. 

## Be a good role model. You are your child's first teacher. Exhibit pride in your traditions while maintaining an 

## interest and respect for the traditions of others. 

## Accepting & respecting differences 

## While you're instilling cultural and ethnic pride in your children, it is important to emphasize that everyone has 

## different traditions and that no tradition is better than another. 

## Let your children know that it's OK to ask questions. Also, be prepared to answer questions—for example, 

## "Why is their skin darker/lighter than mine?" If you don't know the answer, you can learn together. 

## Acknowledge and talk about current events related to race and racism. Use current events, when age

## appropriate, to discuss feelings about racial inequalities, and remember to point out news that celebrates 

## diversity too. It's important to start and keep the conversation going (see "Using Books to Talk With Kids About 

## Race and Racism (/English/healthy-living/emotional-wellness/Building-Resilience/Pages/using-books-to-talk

## with-kids-about-race-and-racism.aspx)"). 

## Learn more about other traditions. Read books, attend cultural festivals or activities, find out whether your 

## friends or other family members have any experiences to share, or explore different restaurants or try new 

## recipes at home. 

## Show by doing. Speak out when you see any signs that some people are not being accepted, even on television or 

## in books you read together. Children learn tolerance from seeing it in action. The best way to teach tolerance is 

## not by ignoring differences but by specifically and routinely celebrating them.
