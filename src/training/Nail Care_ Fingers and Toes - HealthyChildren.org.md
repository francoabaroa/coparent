# Nail Care: Fingers and Toes 

## The only care your child’s nails require is trimming. You can use a soft emery board, baby nail 

## clippers, or blunt-nosed toenail scissors, but be very careful when using clippers or scissors 

## because accidentally cutting the tip of your baby’s finger will cause pain and bleeding. 

## A good time to trim nails is after a bath if your baby will lie quietly, but you may find it easiest to 

## do when she’s asleep. Keep her fingernails as short and smoothly trimmed as possible so she 

## can’t scratch herself (or you). 

## In the early weeks, her fingers are so small and her nails grow so quickly you may have to trim 

## them twice a week. Also, as odd as it may sound, some parents bite their child’s nails as a way of trimming them, which 

## they should avoid doing to prevent the risk of a condition called herpetic whitlow (a finger or thumb infection caused 

## by the herpes simplex virus). 

## By contrast, your baby’s toenails grow much more slowly and are usually very soft and pliable. They needn’t be kept as 

## short as the fingernails, so you may have to trim them only once or twice a month. Because they are so soft, they 

## sometimes look as if they’re ingrown, but there’s no cause for concern unless the skin alongside the nail gets red, 

## inflamed, or hard. As your baby gets older, his toenails will become harder and better defined.
