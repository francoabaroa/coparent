# What Dads Are Good For: A Pediatrician-Dad’s Perspective 

## By: David L. Hill, MD, FAAP 

## "Dad, what are you good for?" 

## If you were to get all your information from greeting cards or 

## commercials (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/Adverse-Effects

## of-Television-Commercials.aspx), you'd think we fathers are mainly 

## around to hog remote controls, collect socket wrenches, and 

## consume beer and chicken wings. Sitcom fans, on the other hand, 

## know that dads leave up toilet seats, burn simple breakfast 

## (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/The-Case-for-Eating

## Breakfast.aspx) foods, and tell little white lies that spin wildly out of control, leading to a series of embarrassing but not 

## life-threatening physical injuries (/english/health-issues/injuries-emergencies/pages/default.aspx). None of these 

## stereotypes apply to real fathers, except maybe the one about the toilet seats. 

## Sharing your unique gifts 

## Of course in reality, there are as many answers to the question of what dads are good for as there are fathers. I love a 

## lot of things about practicing pediatrics, but I especially enjoy seeing how different dads nurture their kids. I meet 

## some real drill sergeants...I mean, they wear uniforms and train military recruits. They also love to cradle their 

## babies. I know a chef who makes his own baby food (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Switching

## To-Solid-Foods.aspx) using vegetables whose names I can't spell. I see a jaded tech writer who can't wait to share new 

## gadgets (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/Healthy-Children-Radio-Kids-Tech.aspx) with his teenaged daughter. In 

## fatherhood, as in the rest of life, each of us has our own unique gifts to share. 

## Seeking out good information 

## Despite recent demographic changes, many people still have low expectations for fathers' general competence; it's 

## always fun to surprise these people. There is no formula to guarantee any child won't end up doing poorly in school 

## (/English/ages-stages/teen/school/Pages/Poor-School-Performance-How-Parents-Can-Help.aspx), experimenting 

## with drugs and alcohol (/English/ages-stages/teen/substance-abuse/Pages/Talking-to-Teens-About-Drugs-and

## Alcohol.aspx), or taking unwise sexual risks (/English/ages-stages/teen/dating-sex/Pages/Adolescent-Sexuality-Talk

## the-Talk-Before-They-Walk-the-Walk.aspx), but you should have a good tool kit to better protect your child from 

## falling into these traps. Seek out good information (like from this website or from this book (http://shop.aap.org/Dad

## to-Dad-Paperback) ) to help you get even better at certain things, from treating diaper rash (/English/ages

## stages/baby/diapers-clothing/Pages/Diaper-Rash-Solution.aspx), to knowing when a cough might represent 

## pneumonia (/English/health-issues/conditions/chest-lungs/Pages/Pneumonia.aspx), to buying your adolescent 

## daughter sanitary napkins (/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/puberty/Pages/Concerns-Girls-Have-About

## Puberty.aspx) (remember, stand up straight and look the checkout lady in the eye; she knows they're not for you). 

## Enjoying the job of a lifetime 

## I used to think that if I could just get my kids past certain dangers, I might stop worrying about them. Once my son 

## turned 1 year old, or my daughter got to kindergarten (/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/school/Pages/Checklist-for

## the-First-Day-of-School.aspx), or my youngest made it into college (/English/ages-stages/young-adult/Pages/Letting

## Go-for-College.aspx), I could relax. I now realize that the moment I became a dad I bought a lifetime of concern. 

## Fatherhood is not a job from which one retires. But really, who would want to? Nothing motivates me to work harder, 

## run faster, or think quicker than my kids. If you hoped for a life of excitement and adventure, you can stop dreaming. 

## This is it. What are you good for as a father? Plenty today, but tomorrow you're guaranteed to add something else 

## (/English/family-life/work-play/Pages/A-Message-for-Grandparents-Who-Provide-Childcare.aspx) to the list.
