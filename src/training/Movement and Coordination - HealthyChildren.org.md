# Movement and Coordination 

## At this age, your child will seem to be continually on the go—running, kicking, climbing, jumping. 

## His attention span, which was never particularly long, may now seem even shorter. Try starting a 

## game with him, and he’ll immediately change to a different one. Head in one direction, and he’ll 

## quickly detour to another. This yearlong energy spurt between ages two and three certainly will 

## keep you on the go. But take heart—his activity level will strengthen his body and develop his 

## coordination. 

## In the months ahead, your child’s running will become smoother and more coordinated. He’ll 

## also learn to kick and direct the motion of a ball, walk up and down steps by himself while holding 

## on, and seat himself confidently in a child-size chair. With a little help, he’ll even be able to stand on one leg. 

## Watch your two-year-old walk, and you’ll see how he has cast aside the stiff, spread-legged gait of a young toddler, 

## replacing it with a more adult, heel-to-toe motion. In the process, he has become much more adept at maneuvering his 

## body, capable of walking backward and turning corners that are not too sharp. He also can do other things as he 

## moves, such as using his hands, talking, and looking around. 

## Don’t worry about finding activities that will help your child develop his motor skills. He’ll probably be able to do that 

## himself. When you are able to join in the fun, bear in mind that children this age love piggyback rides, rolling on mats, 

## going down small slides, and climbing (with help) on the floor-level balance beam. The more running and climbing 

## your games involve, the better. 

## If you can, set aside specific times during the day when he can go outside to run, play, and explore. This will help 

## minimize wear and tear on the inside of the house as well as on your nerves. It’s also safer for him to run around in the 

## open than to bump into walls and furniture inside. While outdoors, let him use the yard, playground, or park— 

## whichever is most available and safe for him. But be aware that since his self-control and judgment lag considerably 

## behind his motor skills, you must remain vigilant and keep safety and injury prevention high on your priority list at all 

## times.
