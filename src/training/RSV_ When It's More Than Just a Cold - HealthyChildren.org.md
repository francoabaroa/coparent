# RSV: When It's More Than Just a Cold 

## By: Andrea Jones, MD, FAAP 

## Almost all children get RSV (/English/tips

## tools/symptom-checker/Pages/symptomviewer.aspx? 

## symptom=RSV-Bronchiolitis) at least once before they 

## are 2 years old. For most healthy children, RSV is like a 

## cold. But, some children get very sick with RSV. 

## What is RSV? 

## RSV (or respiratory syncytial virus) is one of the many 

## viruses that cause respiratory illness―illnesses of the 

## nose, throat and lungs. This virus usually occurs in the 

## late fall through early spring months, but can vary in different parts of the country. 

## With mask-wearing and physical distancing for COVID-19, there were fewer cases of RSV in 2020. However, once 

## safety measures relaxed with the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines (/English/health-issues/conditions/COVID

## 19/Pages/covid-vaccines-for-kids-6-months-and-older-faqs-for-families.aspx), a rise in RSV cases began in spring 2021. 

## The spread of RSV and other seasonal respiratory illnesses (/English/health-issues/conditions/COVID-19/Pages/How

## is-the-Flu-Different-From-COVID-19.aspx) like influenza (flu (/English/health-issues/conditions/flu/Pages/the-flu

## what-parents-need-to-know.aspx)) has also started earlier than usual this year.

## RSV symptoms in babies 

## Typically, RSV causes a cold (/English/health-issues/conditions/ear-nose-throat/Pages/Children-and-Colds.aspx), 

## which may be followed by bronchiolitis (/English/health-issues/conditions/chest-lungs/Pages/bronchiolitis.aspx) or 

## pneumonia. Symptoms generally last an average of 5-7 days. 


### Cold: Upper Respiratory Tract 

### Infection 

### Bronchiolitis: Lower Respiratory Tract 

### Infection 

###### Cold symptoms may include: 

###### Fever (temperature of 100.4 or higher) 

###### Cough (dry or wet sounding) 

###### Congestion 

###### Runny nose 

###### Sneezing 

###### Fussiness 

###### Poor feeding (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding

###### nutrition/Pages/How-Often-and-How-Much

###### Should-Your-Baby-Eat.aspx) 

###### May include cold symptoms, plus: 

###### Fast breathing 

###### Flaring of the nostrils & head bobbing with 

###### breathing 

##### Rhythmic grunting during breathing (see sound clip 

##### clip, below) 

###### Belly breathing, tugging between the ribs and/or the 

##### lower neck (see video, below) 

###### Wheezing 

### How hard is your baby breathing? What to look for. 

###### Chest wall retractions happen when a baby must use muscles between the ribs or in the neck to breathe. It is a sign 

###### that your baby is having to work harder than normal to breathe. 

###### Watch your child's rib cage as they inhale. If you see it "caving in" and forming an upside-down "V" shape under 

###### the neck, then they are working too hard.

## Is your baby or young child at a greater risk of this respiratory 

## illness? 

###### Infants with a higher risk for severe RSV infection include: 

###### 12 weeks old or younger at the start of RSV season 

###### Premature or low birth weight infants (especially those born before 29 weeks gestation) 

###### Chronic lung disease of prematurity 

###### Babies with certain types of heart defects (/English/health-issues/conditions/heart/Pages/Common-Heart

###### Defects.aspx) 

###### Those with weak immune systems due to illness or treatments

###### Additional risk factors for severe RSV infections include low birth weight (/English/news/Pages/Providing

###### Breastmilk-for-Very-Low-Birth-Weight-Infants.aspx), having siblings, a mother's smoking during pregnancy, 

###### exposure to secondhand smoke (/English/health-issues/conditions/tobacco/Pages/Dangers-of-Secondhand

###### Smoke.aspx) in the home, history of allergies and eczema, not breastfeeding, and being around children in a child 

###### care setting or living in crowded living conditions. 

## When should you call the doctor? 

###### RSV symptoms are typically at their worst on days 3 through 5 of illness. Fortunately, almost all children recover 

###### from an RSV infection on their own. 

### Call your pediatrician right away if your child has any: 

##### Symptoms of bronchiolitis (listed above) 

###### Symptoms of dehydration (/English/health-issues/injuries-emergencies/Pages/dehydration.aspx) (fewer than 1 

###### wet diaper every 8 hours) 

###### Pauses or difficulty breathing 

###### Gray or blue color to tongue, lips or skin 

###### Significantly decreased activity and alertness 

###### Some children with RSV may be at increased risk of developing a bacterial infection, such as an ear infection 

###### (/English/health-issues/conditions/ear-nose-throat/Pages/Ear-Infection-Information.aspx). Call your doctor if your 

###### child has: 

###### Symptoms that worsen or do not start to improve after 7 days 

###### A fever (/English/health-issues/conditions/fever/Pages/Fever-and-Your-Baby.aspx) (with a rectal temperature of 

###### 100.4°F or higher) and they are younger than 3 months of age (12 weeks). 

###### A fever (/English/health-issues/conditions/fever/Pages/Fever-Without-Fear.aspx) that rises above 104°F 

###### repeatedly for a child of any age. 

###### Poor sleep or fussiness, chest pain, ear tugging or ear drainage 

RSV-sound 

## How do doctors diagnose RSV? 

###### Pediatricians diagnose children with a cold or bronchiolitis by asking about their symptoms and by doing a physical 

###### exam. Your pediatrician may do a nasal swab test to determine if your child has RSV or another virus. A chest x-ray 

###### and/or oxygen saturation test may also be done to check for lung congestion. Because most children recover without 

###### difficulty and because there is no treatment for RSV, these tests usually are not necessary.

## Is RSV contagious? 

###### Yes. RSV spreads just like a common-cold virus―from one person to another. It enters the body through the nose or 

###### eyes or, usually from: 

###### Direct person-to-person contact with saliva, mucus, or nasal discharge. 

###### Unclean hands (RSV can survive 30 minutes or more on unwashed hands). 

###### Unclean objects or surfaces (RSV can survive up to 6 hours on surfaces, toys, keyboards, door knobs, etc). 

###### Symptoms can appear 2 to 8 days after contact with RSV. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and 

###### Prevention (CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/index.html)), people infected with RSV are usually contagious for 3 to 8 

###### days. However, some infants and people with weakened immune systems can be contagious for as long as four 

###### weeks―even if they are not showing symptoms. 

###### Keep in mind, children and adults can get RSV multiple times–even during a single season. Often, however, repeat 

###### infections are less severe than the first one. 

## What can you do to help your child feel better? 

###### There is no cure for RSV and medications, like steroids and antibiotics, do not help with RSV. 

### To help your child feel more comfortable, begin by doing what you would for any 

### bad cold (/English/health-issues/conditions/chest-lungs/Pages/Coughs-and

### Colds-Medicines-or-Home-Remedies.aspx): 

###### Nasal saline with gentle suctioning to allow easier breathing and feeding. 

###### Cool-mist humidifier (/English/health-issues/conditions/chest-lungs/Pages/Coughs-and-Colds

###### Medicines-or-Home-Remedies.aspx) to help break up mucus and allow easier breathing. 

###### Fluids & frequent feedings. Make sure your child is staying hydrated (/English/health-issues/injuries

###### emergencies/Pages/dehydration.aspx). Infants with a common cold may feed more slowly or not feel like eating 

###### because they are having trouble breathing. Try to section baby's nose before trying to breast or bottle-feed. 

###### Supplementing with water or formula is unnecessary for breastfed babies. If difficult for the baby to feed at the 

###### breast, expressing (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Hand-Expressing-Milk.aspx) breastmilk into 

###### a cup or bottle may be an option. 

###### Acetaminophen or ibuprofen (/English/health-issues/conditions/fever/Pages/Medications-Used-to-Treat

###### Fever.aspx) (if older than 6 months) to help with low-grade fevers. Always avoid (/English/health

###### issues/conditions/fever/Pages/Medications-Used-to-Treat-Fever.aspx) aspirin and cough and cold medications 

###### (/English/health-issues/conditions/chest-lungs/Pages/Coughs-and-Colds-Medicines-or-Home-Remedies.aspx). 

## Do babies with RSV need to be hospitalized? 

###### Only 1% to 2% (https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/high-risk/infants-young

###### children.html#:~:text=One%20to%20two%20out%20of%2cmachine%20to%20help%20with%20breathing%29.) of 

###### children younger than 6 months of age with RSV infection may require a hospital stay (/English/health

###### issues/injuries-emergencies/Pages/What-to-Expect-If-Your-Child-is-Admitted-to-the-Hospital.aspx). Those babies 

###### may need oxygen (/English/ages-stages/baby/preemie/Pages/When-Baby-Needs-Oxygen-At-Home.aspx) to help with 

###### breathing or an (intravenous) IV line for fluids. Most of these children can go home after 2 or 3 days. Rarely, a child 

###### may need care in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). 

## How can you protect your children from RSV? 

###### Wash your hands! (/English/health-issues/conditions/prevention/Pages/Hand-Washing-A-Powerful-Antidote-to

###### Illness.aspx) Just as you would to prevent germs at any time, use soap and water and scrub for at least 20 seconds. 

###### Remind children to practice good hand hygiene all through the year.

### Other ways to help prevent RSV 

###### Vaccinate. Keep your children up to date on their immunizations (/English/safety

###### prevention/immunizations/Pages/Recommended-Immunization-Schedules.aspx) and get the whole family 

###### annual flu shots (/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Prepare-Your-Family-for-Flu-Season.aspx). 

###### Getting vaccinated with Tdap (/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Tetanus-Diphtheria-Pertussis

###### Tdap-Vaccine-What-You-Need-to-Know.aspx)―to protect against whooping cough (/English/health

###### issues/conditions/chest-lungs/Pages/Whooping-Cough.aspx) is especially important for adults who are around 

###### infant—new parents, grandparents, babysitters, nannies, etc. Your child should also be immunized against 

###### COVID-19. 

###### Limit your baby's exposure to crowds, other children, and anyone with colds. Keep them home from school or 

###### child care (/English/family-life/work-play/Pages/When-to-Keep-Your-Child-Home-from-Child-Care.aspx) when 

###### they are sick and teach them to cover their coughs and sneezes. 

###### Go germ-free. Disinfect objects and surfaces in your home regularly and avoid exposing your child to smoke 

###### from tobacco or other substances. 

###### Feed your baby breastmilk. It has unique antibodies (/English/ages

###### stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Breastfeeding-Benefits-Your-Babys-Immune-System.aspx) to prevent and 

###### fight infections. 

### Monoclonal antibody injections for high-risk infants 

###### There is a monoclonal antibody treatment 

###### (https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/143/3/e20182308/37270/Monoclonal-Antibody-Treatment-of-RSV

###### Bronchiolitis) that may reduce the risk of severe RSV infection in some high-risk infants. Your pediatrician will let you 

###### know if your baby is a candidate. 

## Hope on the horizon for RSV 

###### Medicine is always advancing! Scientists are currently studying vaccines to prevent and medications to treat RSV. We 

###### may have more options in the future. In the meantime, rest assured that most children recover well from RSV and 

###### grow to be healthy adults.
