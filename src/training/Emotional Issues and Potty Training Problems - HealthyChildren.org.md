# Emotional Issues and Potty Training Problems 

## Emotional causes of bathroom-related problems are 

## among the most challenging to address, since young 

## children are rarely able to express their confusion, 

## anxiety, or fear in words. Behaviors such as defecating 

## (pooping) in a corner of the bedroom, having daily 

## accidents at school after many months of complete 

## dryness, or pleading to return to diapers are disturbing 

## and even frightening to many parents—more so when 

## they do not understand the cause. 

## Once physical causes have been ruled out, however, the 

## reasons behind many of these behaviors can be 

## unearthed by considering any changes in your child’s 

## life or emotional development, observing thier other behaviors and listening carefully to what they say. 

## Potty training regression: why it happens & how to react 

## A major change in a child's life can cause them to regress during toilet training. Regression can occur for similar 

## reasons long after toilet training. A new baby in the family, a move to a new home, family conflict, or any other 

## emotionally stressful situation may cause your child to revert to an earlier level of bathroom mastery. This may 

## involve bedwetting (/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/Bedwetting.aspx), puddling, withholding of 

## stool and even pooping in inappropriate places. Inner stress prompted by your child’s normal development can affect 

## her bathroom behaviors as well. 

## Other feelings and emotional situations can overwhelm your young child and cause them to behave in ways that seem 

## puzzling at first. A desire for more attention may cause them to stage more accidents just to engage you in 

## conversation or emotional interaction. If they feel you have been too controlling about bathroom use—constantly 

## asking if they need to go instead of letting them direct their own behavior—they may resist going until it’s too late and 

## they have an accident instead. 

## A more active imagination and a tendency toward magical thinking may cause them to fear the toilet and start to 

## avoid it. Even a desire to befriend another child by imitating them can lead to regressive bathroom behavior if the 

## other child is not toilet-trained. Finally, a temporary wish to return to coddled babyhood, which nearly all young 

## When your child tries to hide their accidents 

## At about three years of age, children start developing the capacity to experience discomfort, or shame, when they 

## have done something they know is wrong. However, most children this age do not know what to do with these 

## feelings. A child who longs for their parents’ approval may suddenly start to feel embarrassed or ashamed after a 

## bathroom accident, no matter how accepting their parents are actually likely to be. As a result, they may claim to 

## have used the bathroom when they really urinated on the living room floor. They may hide their wet underwear, 

## or even try to clean up the mess before you see it. 

## There is no cause to criticize or punish a child who behaves in this way. On the contrary, they have 

## demonstrated that they know what proper bathroom behavior is and are trying as best they can to make it "come 

## true." The best response when you find your child hiding their accidents from you is to gently tell them that you 

## know they had an accident, that it’s okay, and that you know they will do better next time. Then ask them to help 

## you clean up, and talk with them about specific ways the two of you can help them get back on track.

## Supporting your child 

### For toilet-trained children, as well as for those still being trained, regression in bathroom use usually does not last 

### long. Respond calmly and use it as an opportunity to support and communicate with your child. Help your child 

### identify the problem, sympathize with their feelings, and help them find practical solutions. Such evidence of your 

### support and understanding will help her to relax and eventually move forward. 

### Meanwhile, try to avoid major concessions such as returning to diapers. Instead, consider offering to put them in

### bathroom before the school day begins, or otherwise compromise until they feel more secure.
