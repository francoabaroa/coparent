# Sports Instruction: A Toddler's Mental Capacity 

## Toddlers have short attention spans (surprise, surprise). They also focus excessive attention on single items no matter 

## their importance (no kidding!). That is why Johnny may be so distracted by an odd looking bug or brightly colored 

## flower that he is completely oblivious of a ball or player going by. 

## Periods of instruction should have as few surrounding distractions as possible and are usually most effective when 

## given as show-and-tell. Youngsters require small amounts of information because the proverbial “too much 

## information” can overload even the most interested toddler in the group. Young children are still concrete thinkers 

## and have difficulty with abstract thinking or processing complex instructions. 

## Application 

## Skills are acquired primarily through unstructured play, so active play such as tag should be encouraged. If there is 

## any organized play, it should be very brief, with the majority of time spent having children just playing among 

## themselves. Frequent changes of players should occur to expose children to different positions. Do not keep score. 

## True competition offers no advantage and should be avoided during this age group. 

## The primary goals of sports activity for toddlers and young children should be playfulness, experimentation, 

## exploration, and having fun. Shudder at the thought, I know, but face the facts. Children just begin to develop the 

## intellectual and thinking skills necessary for next-level activities and safety at around ages 5 to 6 years. And if that did 

## not make you gasp, this one will—research shows that participation in sports programs during the toddler years does 

## not seem to give any long-term advantage for future sports performance. Uh-oh, does that mean that spending 3 hours 

## a day practicing with your 4-year-old daughter won’t make her a better kindergarten or grade-school athlete? That’s 

## right. Specific skills can be refined by repetitive practice only after the right level of motor development has been 

## reached. Basic ground-level activities for children such as walking, running, swimming, tumbling activities in 

## beginner dance and gymnastics, basic soccer, basic martial arts, and skating are suggested appropriate activities. In 

## addition, walking, running, and swimming are activities that also develop fundamental skills that are important for 

## safety throughout life. 

## These activities can form sturdy foundations for exercise and sports participation on which future skills can be 

## building blocks for the Great Wall of Sports. A few words of caution, however—just because these activities can be 

## started early in life does not mean that these sports should be aggressively pursued early in life. We have all seen 

## Olympic moments showing the rise of sports stars who started their sport at age 3. But that does not mean they started 

## training substantially or competing heavily at 3 years of age. These situations are often misinterpreted by other 

## parents and young athletes because we don’t always know the rest of the story. Those youth later became Olympians 

## because of many more factors than an early start date, and research from the US Olympic Committee shows that most 

## Olympians distinctly point out that they had support from their parents, were not pressured, and stayed in their sport 

## because of the love of the sport and because they had fun. Sports activities may be started early if approached with a 

## non-pressure attitude that focuses only on basic skills and not with the presumption that this is the beginning of an 

## Olympic or professional debut.
