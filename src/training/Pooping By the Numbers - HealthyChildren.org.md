# Pooping By the Numbers 

## Once babies have proven themselves capable of clearing out their meconium and have moved on 

## to dishing out the “real thing,” you can be relatively assured that their plumbing is in good 

## working order and turn your attention to the so-called normal pooping patterns of infancy. 

## What’s considered normal at this stage of the game (and for months to come) ranges anywhere 

## from one poop every several days to several poops every day. Some are like the sprinters of the 

## pooping world—fast and furious—while others are more like distance runners—slow and steady. 

## In general, breastfed babies poop more than formula-fed ones, and younger babies poop more 

## than older ones. Newborn babies and young infants also tend to have several tiny poops in succession, so as a point of 

## practicality we recommend waiting a few minutes until your newborn is convincingly finished rather than jumping 

## into diaper-changing action after the first signs of activity. 

## From your pediatrician’s perspective, the actual number of poops is likely to be less important than the fact that 

## everything is generally moving along. 

## Enough is Enough 

## In the spirit of helping you distinguish between the healthy but fast and furious pooper and those newborns pooping 

## beyond the limits of acceptability, experts in the field of newborn care suggest the following rule of thumb: Any time a 

## newborn’s poop becomes progressively more watery or outpaces feeding frequency, it’s time to seek medical advice.
