# Toilet Training Setbacks 

## Stacy and Hal’s daughter, Lindy, was toilet-trained at the early age of twenty-four months with surprisingly few of the 

## problems her playmates eventually faced. For more than a year, she had been off diapers and using a potty. Of course, 

## there had been some accidents, particularly during the first six months following toilet training, but fewer overall than 

## her parents had expected. 

## Now that Lindy was four and attending preschool, however, a new challenge presented itself. Lindy had started 

## “leaking” small amounts of urine once or twice a day. Her parents frequently found that her underwear was slightly 

## damp when Lindy got home from school or when she undressed for her bath at night. It wasn’t that she was having 

## accidents—she still easily stopped what she was doing and went to the bathroom when she needed to eliminate—but 

## she seemed to experience a certain amount of dribbling between potty sessions that she was unable to control. The 

## dampness didn’t bother Lindy, but her parents worried that a physical, developmental, or even emotional problem 

## might be the cause. 

## As Lindy’s situation indicates, issues relating to bladder and bowel control can arise not only during the actual toilet 

## training process but long after parents assume that their children are fully trained. In many cases, such setbacks can 

## be remedied with relative ease once the causes have been identified. 

## Medical or psychological intervention may be necessary. No matter what the reason behind your own child’s problem, 

## the earlier you address the issue, the better the chances that it will be resolved without seriously affecting your child. 

## Additional articles in this section of the web site will identify many of the most common problems experienced by 

## young children who have completed toilet training, listing the most common reasons behind such behaviors, and 

## offering general guidelines for parents to follow in correcting them. 

## Still, there is no substitute for the individual advice of your child’s pediatrician. A conversation with, or visit to, your 

## child’s doctor is the first step in combating any disturbing or ongoing issue.
