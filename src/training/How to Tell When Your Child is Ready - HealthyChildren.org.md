# How to Tell When Your Child is Ready 

## Lindy, two and a half, has recently begun demonstrating many of the signs of readiness for toilet 

## training. When she senses that she’s about to wet her diaper, she gets a funny look on her face 

## and sometimes drops into a squatting position. When she’s about to have a bowel movement, she 

## runs and hides behind the couch. She’s even figured out how to get her diaper off and loves to run 

## around the house naked whenever she gets the chance. Lindy’s parents agree that this seems to 

## be the perfect time to start. Yet when they point out the potty in the bathroom to Lindy and 

## suggest that she sit on it for a while, she just laughs and runs away. She’d rather risk an accident— 

## and her parents’ annoyance—than sit still long enough to use the bathroom. 

## Determining the best time to begin toilet training is not always easy—not only because readiness occurs at different 

## ages for different children, but because your child may be ready in one area of development but not in another. A one

## year-old who happily sits on her potty to look at picture books still may not be able to comprehend the potty’s real 

## purpose, while a two-year-old who knows what potties are for may refuse to use his out of a toddler’s natural desire to 

## remain in almost constant motion. 

## In general, most children become physiologically ready for toilet training at around eighteen months of age—that is, 

## their digestive system and bladder have matured to the point where they can delay a bowel movement or urination 

## long enough to get to a potty. But they are usually not cognitively ready—able to associate the need to eliminate with 

## potty use, to remember to use it, and to resist distraction long enough to complete the process—until sometime after 

## their second birthday. The motor skills needed to get to the bathroom, manage clothes, and sit still on the potty are 

## also clearly important. 

## So is the emotional urge toward independence and self-mastery—as well as sufficient emotional maturity to relax 

## control sufficiently to avoid constipation. Social readiness—an awareness of others’ toilet use and a desire to imitate 

## their behavior—is a powerful motivating force for toddlers and preschoolers. Another factor is the verbal ability to 

## understand your explanations of how toilet use works and to communicate to you any confusion or uneasiness they 

## feel. 

## As you can see, a range of physical and psychological developments help support the process of toilet training. While 

## it isn’t necessary to wait until you’re sure that every one of these developments is in place, each step does increase the 

## chances of toilet-training success.
