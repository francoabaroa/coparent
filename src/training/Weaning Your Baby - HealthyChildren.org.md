# Weaning Your Baby 

## By: Joan Younger Meek, MD, MS, RD, FAAP, FABM, IBCLC 

## Knowing exactly when to wean your baby isn't always 

## easy, but it's an inevitable event for any nursing mother. 

## The key is doing it gradually and making sure that both 

## you and your baby are ready for this transition. 

## Is this the right time? 

## Chances are both and your baby have enjoyed the 

## closeness that comes with breastfeeding. In fact, you 

## may want to continue nursing your child through 

## toddlerhood. But your child's active temperament may 

## cause them to be too impatient to continue to nurse. 

## On the other hand, your child may want to continue nursing long past his first year, particularly before bedtime and 

## when they're in need of comfort. But you may feel the need to move on to the next phase of parenting, with more 

## independence. 

## The simplest, most natural time to wean is when your child starts the process. Weaning may begin naturally at six 

## months, when solid foods rich in iron and protein should be introduced. Some infants begin to turn gradually away 

## from breastfeeding and toward other forms of nutrition and comfort at around one year of age, when they have begun 

## to enjoy a wide variety of solid foods and have learned to drink from a cup. Others wean themselves during the toddler 

## years as they become more physically active and less willing to sit still to nurse. 

## Gradually tapering off how often you nurse—by eliminating a feeding every two or three days, or even once a week— 

## can help the weaning process proceed smoothly. As your child becomes so busy with new experiences, they may 

## forgets it's time to nurse. 

## You may, however, decide to start weaning earlier for reasons of your own. These may include the need to be away 

## from home for longer periods, a new pregnancy, job constraints, or even a lack of desire to keep breastfeeding. (It is 

## important to remember, though, that you can continue to breastfeed even if you have become pregnant or return to 

## work. You can reduce the frequency of breastfeeding, for example, and start using some infant formula.) 

## Starting the weaning process yourself will not be as easy as following your child's lead. But with care and sensitivity, it's 

## certainly doable. Keep in mind that you have provided the best start for your baby by breastfeeding, no matter how 

## early or late you decide to stop. Some breastfeeding is better than none. No one but you can decide what is best for you 

## and your infant. 

## The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends continued breastfeeding beyond a baby's first birthday, as long 

## as desired by mother and child. 

## Did you know that the nutritional content of mother's milk keeps changing beyond the first year to meet a 

## growing baby's needs? It continues to support a baby's immune system, too. And other protective effects tied to 

## mother's milk, such as lower risk of certain cancers in child and mother, appear strongest with breastfeeding 

## beyond a child's first birthday. 


## A gradual parting: How to wean 

### The best way to wean is gradually moving toward other forms of nutrition and closeness. Ideally, the number and 

### length of breastfeeding sessions should tapering off over weeks or even months. In this way, you and your child will 

### have time to find other ways to maintain closeness, express and accept tenderness or comfort, and ensure proper 

### nutritional intake before you completely stop nursing. You will also avoid the conflicts and resistance that tend to 

### spring from more abrupt weaning and even minimize your own physical difficulties such as breast engorgement. 

### One of the most effective ways to begin a gradual weaning process with a child age one or older is simply not to offer a 

### feeding and wait to see if they request it. The easiest first session to skip in this way is usually the midday 

### breastfeeding, when your child may already have had access to a lunch of solid food and such liquids as cow's milk or 

### water. 

### If your child gets used to missing the midday nursing session, take a look at skipping a second feeding in the same 

### way. Redirect your child's attention to new activities, other food options, and sources of emotional reassurance (such 

### as a favorite blanket or stuffed animal) to help make the transition easier. 

### If your child decides that they still want to nurse, offer the breast. This will reassure that you are still there for them as 

### they continue to explore their surroundings. If they cling to one or two favorite feeding times—usually the last one 

### before bedtime and the first one in the morning—consider continuing these sessions for as long as they want to 

### nurse. Such quiet times rarely interfere with even the busiest family's schedule, and are a wonderful way to maintain 

### that special closeness with your child. 

## If your child resists weaning 

### Some children strongly object to their mother's efforts to move from breast to bottle or cup, no matter how sensitively 

### and gradually the process is approached. This can become frustrating if you want or need to wean by a specific time 

### (for example, if you need to start back to work or school and have decided not to express your milk during separation). 

### Consider shortening your nursing sessions as a prelude to dropping them altogether. At the times of day when your 

### child is used to nursing, stay away from spots where you usually nurse. Involve your baby in an interesting activity. 

### Avoid such strong nursing cues as pulling them onto your lap, uncovering your breasts in front of them, or even sitting 

### down. 

### If your baby still resists weaning, consider whether you might continue breastfeeding—just less often—while offering 

### a cup, bottle, or other foods at other times. By partially weaning (for example, initially keeping the early morning and 

### bedtime feedings, and then gradually dropping the early morning session), you eliminate a source of conflict between 

### your child and yourself that may turn out to be unnecessary. You also send your child the message that you are paying 

### attention to their feelings and responding to them. 

### Eventually you can agree with your older child on an endpoint for nursing. In the meantime, your willingness to 

### recognize their needs and provide for them sets an excellent pattern in your relationship for the years to come.
