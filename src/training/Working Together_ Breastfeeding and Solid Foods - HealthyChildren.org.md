# Working Together: Breastfeeding and Solid Foods 

## Breastfeeding, like many other aspects of parenting, is a gradual process of increasing 

## independence and self-mastery on your baby’s part and a gradual stepping back on yours. You 

## may have already experienced the beginnings of this process during the first half year of life as 

## your baby learned to enjoy drinking expressed breast milk from a bottle or cup and you began to 

## go places without her. Still, the two of you were closely tied to each other in a nutritional sense: 

## your child thrived on your breast milk alone, which provided the nutrients she needed. 

## During the second half of the year, your breast milk will continue to provide the great majority of 

## necessary nutrients as she starts to sample a variety of new foods. Though your baby will no 

## doubt greatly enjoy the introduction of new tastes and textures in her life, her experiences with solid food are still just 

## practice sessions for the future. It’s important to make sure she continues getting enough breast milk to meet her 

## nutritional needs. 

## Introducing foods 

## The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breastfeeding as the sole source of nutrition for your baby for 

## about 6 months. When you add solid foods to your baby’s diet, continue breastfeeding until at least 12 months. You 

## can continue to breastfeed after 12 months if you and your baby desire. Check with your child’s doctor about vitamin 

## D and iron supplements during the first year. 

## Parents with food allergies are often advised to avoid foods that commonly cause allergic reactions (such as cow’s 

## milk, dairy products, and foods made from peanuts or other nuts). But recent research found that the late introduction 

## of certain foods may actually increase your baby’s risk for food allergies and inhaled allergies. You should discuss any 

## concerns with your pediatrician. 

## If no allergies are present, simply observe your baby for indications that she is interested in trying new foods and then 

## start to introduce them gradually, one by one. Signs that the older baby is ready for solids include sitting up with 

## minimal support, showing good head control, trying to grab food off your plate, or turning her head to refuse food 

## when she is not hungry. Your baby may be ready for solids if she continues to act hungry after breastfeeding. The loss 

## of the tonguethrusting reflex that causes food to be pushed out of her mouth is another indication that she’s ready to 

## expand her taste experience. 

## First foods 

## Since most breastfeeding babies’ iron stores begin to diminish at about six months, good first choices for solids are 

## those rich in iron. Current recommendations are that meats, such as turkey, chicken, and beef, should be added as one 

## of the first solids to the breastfed infant’s diet. Meats are good sources of high-quality protein, iron, and zinc and 

## provide greater nutritional value than cereals, fruits, or vegetables. 

## Iron-fortified infant cereal (such as rice cereal or oatmeal) is another good solid food to complement breast milk. 

## When first starting infant cereal, check the label to make sure that the cereal is a singleingredient product—that is, 

## rice cereal or oatmeal—and does not contain added fruit, milk or yogurt solids, or infant formula. This will decrease 

## the likelihood of an allergic reaction with the initial cereal feedings. You can mix the cerealwith your breast milk, 

## water, or formula (if you’ve already introduced formula to your baby) until it is a thin consistency. As your baby gets 

## used to the taste and texture, you can gradually make it thicker and increase the amount. 

## Once your child has grown accustomed to these new tastes, gradually expand her choices with applesauce, pears, 

## peaches, bananas, or other mashed or strained fruit, and such vegetables as cooked carrots, peas, and sweet potatoes. 

## Introduce only one new food at a time and wait several days before you add another new food, to make sure your child 

## does not have a negative reaction. 

## As you learn which foods your baby enjoys and which ones she clearly dislikes, your feeding relationship will grow 

## beyond nursing to a more complex interaction— not a replacement for breastfeeding, certainly, but an interesting 

## addition to it. Remember to keep exposing your baby to a wide variety of foods. Research indicates that some babies

## need multiple exposures to a new taste before they learn to enjoy it. The breastfed baby has already been 

## experiencing different flavors in the mother’s breast milk, based upon her diet, so solid foods often have a familiar 

## taste when introduced to the breastfed baby. 

## Babies need only a few spoonfuls as they begin solids. Since these first foods are intended as complements and not 

## replacements for your breast milk, it’s best to offer them after a late afternoon or evening feeding, when your milk 

## supply is apt to be at its lowest and your baby may still be hungry. 

## Some pediatricians recommend an iron supplement. If this is the case, be careful to give the exact dose prescribed by 

## your doctor. Always store iron and vitamin preparations out of the reach of young children in the household, since 

## overdoses can be toxic. 

## You may find that the number of breastfeedings will gradually decrease as her consumption of solid food increases. A 

## baby who nursed every two to three hours during early infancy may enjoy three or four meals of breast milk per day 

## (along with several snacks) by her twelfth month. 

## Unless you intend to wean her soon, be sure to continue breastfeeding whenever she desires, to ensure your 

## continuing milk supply. To ease breast discomfort, it may become necessary to express a small amount of milk 

## manually on occasion, if her decreasing demand leaves you with an oversupply. Breast comfort is another reason why 

## a gradual introduction of solid foods is advisable, since it allows your body time to adapt to changing demands. Over 

## the span of several months, a readjustment in the supply-and-demand relationship can take place smoothly and 

## painlessly.
