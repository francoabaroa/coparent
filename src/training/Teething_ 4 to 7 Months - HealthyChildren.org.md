# Teething: 4 to 7 Months 

## Teething usually starts during these months. The two front teeth (central incisors), either upper 

## or lower, usually appear first, followed by the opposite front teeth. The first molars come in next, 

## followed by the canines or eyeteeth. 

## The timing of teething: 

## There is great variability in the timing of teething. If your child doesn’t show any teeth until later 

## than this age period, don’t worry. The timing may be determined by heredity, and it doesn’t mean 

## that anything is wrong. 

## How to ease your baby’s discomfort: 

## Teething occasionally may cause mild irritability, crying, a low-grade temperature (but not over 101 degrees 

## Fahrenheit or 38.3 degrees Celsius), excessive drooling, and a desire to chew on something hard. More often, the gums 

## around the new teeth will swell and be tender. Try gently rubbing or massaging the gums with one of your fingers. 

## Teething rings are helpful, too, but they should be made of firm rubber. (The teethers that you freeze tend to get too 

## hard and can cause more harm than good.) Pain relievers and medications that you rub on the gums are not necessary 

## or useful since they wash out of the baby’s mouth within minutes. Some medication you rub on your child’s gums can 

## even be harmful if too much is used and the child swallows an excessive amount. Stay away from teething tablets that 

## contain the plant poison belladonna and gels with benzocaine. Belladonna and benzocaine are marketed to numb 

## your child's pain, but the FDA has issued warnings against both due to potential side effects. If your child seems 

## particularly miserable or has a fever higher than 101 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 degrees Celsius), it’s probably not 

## because she’s teething, and you should consult your pediatrician. 

## How should you clean the new teeth? 

## Simply brush them with a soft child’s toothbrush when you first start seeing her teeth. To prevent cavities, never let 

## your baby fall asleep with a bottle, either at nap time or at night. By avoiding this situation, you’ll keep milk from 

## pooling around the teeth and creating a breeding ground for decay.
