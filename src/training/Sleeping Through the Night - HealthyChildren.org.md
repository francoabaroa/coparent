# Sleeping Through the Night 

## Healthy, growing babies usually do not need to be awakened to breastfeed (/english/ages

## stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/default.aspx) or take a bottle (/English/ages

## stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Bottle-Feeding.aspx). 

## Check with your pediatrician about nighttime awakening 

## if your baby is not doing the following: 

## Growing and gaining weight steadily. 

## Feeding well 8 to 12 times a day for a breastfeeding baby or 5 to 8 times a day for a bottle-fed baby or older infant. 

## Urinating normally with at least 4 wet diapers a day. 

## Having at least 3 normal bowel movements per day. Most breastfeeding babies have more frequent bowel 

## movements that are soft and seedy. 

## Concrete Ways to Help Newborns Learn How to Sleep 

## Help him fall asleep with a soothing sensation, such as rocking, sucking a thumb or hand, or nonnutritive 

## suckling at the breast. However, never place your baby in the crib with a bottle for comfort. The natural sugar in 

## many liquids promotes growth of the bacteria that cause tooth decay (/English/ages-stages/baby/teething-tooth

## care/Pages/Preventing-Tooth-Decay.aspx), and the effect is especially severe when the sugary residue stays in the 

## mouth all night long. This can result in serious dental decay, known as nursing bottle caries, in developing 

## primary teeth. Liquid, even water, pooling in the mouth can also back up through the eustachian tubes, the tiny 

## passages that run between the throat and ear. This can set up conditions that foster the development of ear 

## infections (/English/health-issues/conditions/ear-nose-throat/Pages/Ear-Infection-Information.aspx). 

## Give him lots of attention while he is awake. Especially early on, babies need help to feel calm and secure. 

## Holding your baby and being sensitive to his signals and needs will not spoil him or reinforce a behavior. 

## Pay attention to signs of being sleepy or overtired. By noticing your baby’s cues early on you’ll also have an 

## opportunity to help him fall asleep before he is overtired. These signs will become easier to identify as you get to 

## know your baby, and in turn, it will become easier for you to settle him for sleep. 

## The bottom line is to meet your baby’s needs early on so that he will be better able to regulate his sleep cycles and 

## emotions. 

## What It Really Means to be a Good Sleeper 

## It’s important for parents, caregivers, families, and friends to understand that at this age, a good sleeper is a child who wakes up 

## frequently but can get himself back to sleep. It is not a child who sleeps without waking for 10 hours at night. Frequent waking is 

## developmentally appropriate and allows the baby to wake up when he is in a situation in which he is not getting enough oxygen or 

## is having problems breathing. Sleeping undisturbed for prolonged periods at this age is not healthy.
