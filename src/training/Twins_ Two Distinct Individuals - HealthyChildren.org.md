# Twins: Two Distinct Individuals 

## Whenever I meet someone who happened to grow up as a twin, I always ask if there was anything 

## he would have preferred his parents to have done differently. Most of the time the response I 

## hear is some variation on a similar theme: I wish our parents didn’t...“give us the same thing for 

## our birthday,” “dress us in identical outfits,” “expect us to share everything.” 

## While some people assume all twins are the same, others take it to the other extreme. Many 

## people ask me if my twin sons are opposites—is one social while the other is a recluse? Is one 

## more talkative and the other quiet? Or, my favorite, “Which is the good one?” These questions 

## imply that each twin’s character traits are defined as the opposite of those of his twin brother. Of 

## course this is not the case—they are individuals, and each child is complete on his own. 

## Any individual can be similar to another in some respects and different in other ways. Everybody, whether born as a 

## twin or not, desires to be treated as an individual. Parents of all twins, identical or same-sex twins more so, need to 

## think about this on a daily basis. You’re a busy parent and it may be quicker or more efficient at times to treat your 

## twins as a unit, but I encourage you to treat your twins as 2 children who happen to have been born on the same day. 

## A great way to treat your twins as individuals is to read their bedtime stories to them individually at night. When our 

## twin boys were babies and toddlers, we were operating in survival mode, so we usually read to them simultaneously. 

## As the years progressed and our twins were easier to care for, we saw that it would benefit both boys to have their 

## bedtime stories read to them one-on-one. Reading to each twin separately boosts early reading skills and creates a 

## calmer atmosphere in which to quiet down and settle in with a good book. The time and work to read to your twins 

## individually is well worth the effort. The twins don’t distract each other and they get a lot more out of the experience. 

## Try to alternate which twin reads with which parent each night. Be realistic, though, and on late nights or if one parent 

## is handling bedtime solo, gather everyone to snuggle up for the bedtime stories. 

## Twins know how to share well, having shared their parents with each other since they were newborns, but expecting 

## twins to share all their things all the time is unrealistic. You’ll want to have a system to give each child her own 

## personal space. Even if your twins share a bedroom, you can provide each twin with a distinctly colored box that they 

## can keep their special things in—a rock collection, a favor from a friend’s party, whatever they decide is important to 

## them. 

## Remind each twin to respect their siblings’ personal space—older and younger siblings’ space as well, as twins can 

## outnumber an older brother and confiscate a special toy by sheer manpower alone. Give each twin her own distinct

## looking piggy bank to collect loose coins. Institute a house rule that you can only check your own piggy bank’s 

## contents! 

## In your living and play areas, create separate play stations so that there are interesting things to do at different places 

## in the home—one twin can play Lincoln Logs in one area while the other goes in the other room to listen to a kids’ CD 

## player. Don’t expect your twins to play with the same items all the time. Give each child some space and breathing 

## room, and your days will be more harmonious. 

## On birthdays and holidays, give each child distinctive presents. At 3 and 4 years of age, each child has particular 

## interests—pick up on these differences and use them as inspiration for giving separate gifts. Adult twins groan when 

## they remember all the times that they received 2 of the same item, maybe in different colors. When our twins were 3 

## years old, we noticed that sharks fascinated Ryan and Andrew was interested in fire trucks, so on their birthday we ran 

## with these themes. The shark-themed books and toys lived on as Ryan’s, and Andrew’s new fire truck was Andrew’s. 

## Emphasize to gift-giving family members to look for distinctive gifts for your twins—they’ll likely appreciate a little 

## coaching. 

## All toys that enter your home will eventually get shared extensively—after all, playing with all the cumulative toys, 

## rather than just your own portion, is more fun! But initially, on gift-giving occasions, give each child at least a day or 

## two with his new toy before he is expected to share with others. After the first couple of days or a period that seems 

## appropriate, the new items can become part of the public domain, fair game for all.

## If your twins are squabbling over who gets to play with a new item, use the egg timer trick. Give each child a timed 

## turn with the toy, and rotate turns. The egg timer helps reassure your twins that the turns will be fair. 

## Another way to emphasize each twin’s individuality is to assign a signature color to each child. At the preschool age 

## kids usually have preferred colors—use these colors for clothes, coats, toothbrushes, and backpacks to clearly indicate 

## who the owner is and streamline the process of getting ready each day. The more distinct the twins’ personal items 

## are, the less confusion as to whose coat is whose will occur. Ah, family harmony.
