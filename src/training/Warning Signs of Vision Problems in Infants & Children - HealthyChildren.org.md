# Warning Signs of Vision Problems in Infants & Children 

## Eye exams by your child's doctor are an important way to identify 

## problems with your child's vision. Problems that are found early 

## have a better chance of being treated successfully. 

## What are warning signs of a vision 

## problem? 

## Babies up to 1 year of age: 

## Babies older than 3 months should be able to follow or track 

## an object, like a toy or ball, with their eyes as it moves across 

## their field of vision. If your baby can't make steady eye contact by this time or seems unable to see, let your 

## child's doctor know. See Infant Vision Development: What Can Babies See? (/English/ages

## stages/baby/Pages/Babys-Vision-Development.aspx) for more information. 

## Before 4 months , most babies' eyes occasionally look misaligned (strabismus). However, after 4 months, inward 

## crossing or outward drifting that occurs regularly is usually abnormal. If one of these is present, let your child's 

## doctor know. 

## Preschool age: 

## If your child's eyes become misaligned, let your child's doctor know right away. However, vision problems such as a 

## lazy eye (/English/health-issues/conditions/eyes/Pages/Amblyopia-Lazy-Eye.aspx) (amblyopia) may have no warning 

## signs, and your child may not report vision problems. That is why it's important at this time to have your child's vision 

## checked. There are special tests to check your child's vision even if he cannot yet read (/English/ages

## stages/preschool/Pages/Helping-Your-Child-Learn-to-Read.aspx). 

## All children: 

## If you notice any of the following signs or symptoms, let your child's doctor know: 

## Eyes that are misaligned (look crossed, turn out, or don't focus together) 

## White or grayish white color in the pupil 

## Eyes that flutter quickly from side to side or up and down 

## Eye pain, itchiness, or discomfort reported by your child. 

## Redness in either eye that doesn't go away in a few days 

## Pus or crust in either eye 

## Eyes that are always watery 

## Drooping eyelids (/English/health-issues/conditions/eyes/pages/Eyelid-Problems.aspx) 

## Eyes that often appear overly sensitive to light
