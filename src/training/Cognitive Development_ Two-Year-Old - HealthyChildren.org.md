# Cognitive Development: Two-Year-Old 

## Think back to your child’s infancy and early toddler months. That was a time when he learned 

## about the world by touching, looking, manipulating, and listening. Now, as a two-year-old, the 

## learning process has become more thoughtful. His grasp of language is increasing, and he’s 

## beginning to form mental images for things, actions, and concepts. He also can solve some 

## problems in his head, performing mental trial-and-error instead of having to manipulate objects 

## physically. And as his memory and intellectual abilities develop, he’ll begin to understand simple 

## time concepts, such as “You can play after you finish eating.” 

## Your toddler also is starting to understand the relationship between objects. For instance, he’ll be 

## able to match similar shapes when you give him shape sorting toys and simple jigsaw puzzles. He’ll also begin to 

## recognize the purpose of numbers in counting objects—especially the number two. And as his understanding of cause 

## and effect develops, he’ll become much more interested in winding up toys and turning lights and appliances on and 

## off. 

## You’ll also notice your toddler’s play growing more complex. Most noticeably, he’ll start stringing together different 

## activities to create a logical sequence. Instead of drifting randomly from one toy to another, he may first put a doll to 

## bed and then cover it up. Or he may pretend to feed several dolls, one after the other. Over the next few years, he’ll put 

## together longer and more elaborate sequences of make-believe, acting out much of his own daily routine, from getting 

## up in the morning to taking a bath and going to bed at night. 

## If we were to single out the major intellectual limitation at this age, it would be your child’s feeling that everything 

## that happens in his world is the result of something he has done. With a belief like this, it becomes very difficult for 

## him to understand correctly such concepts as death, divorce, or illness, without feeling that he played some role in it. 

## So if parents separate or a family member gets sick, children often feel responsible. 

## Reasoning with your two-year-old is often difficult. After all, he views everything in extremely simple terms. He still 

## often confuses fantasy with reality unless he’s actively playing make-believe. Therefore, during this stage, be sure to 

## choose your own words carefully: Comments that you think are funny or playful—such as “If you eat more cereal, 

## you’ll explode”—actually may panic him, since he won’t know you’re joking.
