# How to Share Books with Your 18 to 23 Month Old 

## Even toddlers children can enjoy books and learn from sharing books with you. Sharing books 

## with your young children can help teach them to talk and get them ready to listen and learn in 

## school. 

## Making Books A Part of Your Child’s Bedtime Routine: 

## Set aside 10 to 15 minutes with the TV off for sharing books as part of your regular bedtime 

## routine. Regular bedtime routines started when your child is young help prevent bedtime 

## struggles. Teaching your children how to fall asleep alone by putting them in bed awake helps 

## prevent future night wakings. 

## 18-23 Month Olds Can: 

## Choose a book to share and tell you they want “more book” or “‘nother book.” 

## Point to a favorite picture and say a word or two about it. 

## Look at familiar animals and make their sounds. 

## Finish some sentences from books they know very well, such as: “ Happy faces. Sad.......”(faces) or “ Big cat, little 

## hat. Big hat, little.......” (cat). 

## Enjoy a trip to your local public library for Story Time or to borrow some books. 

## What Parents Can Do: 

## Find a quiet, comfortable place for book sharing. 

## Help your child pronounce words better by imitating their word, then pronouncing it correctly and using it in a 

## short phrase. 

## Help your child understand by speaking in slow, short sentences, and waiting for your child to take a turn talking. 

## Use book sharing as a way to calm and comfort your child.
