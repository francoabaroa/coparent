# Potty Training Regression 

## "Our daughter made great progress with toilet training 

## the first two weeks. But when she started at the new 

## child-care center, it was like she forgot everything she’d 

## learned. She never told the adults in charge when she 

## needed to go. She had one or two accidents a day at the 

## center, and even had them at home on the weekends. 

## When we tried to talk to her about it, she would just 

## look at us like she had no idea what we were talking 

## about, or would run away and play." 

## As adults, we are accustomed to acquiring new skills at 

## a steady pace and retaining what we learn. For young 

## children, though, learning often depends on their 

## development in other areas. They often progress in a series of sudden spurts interspersed with periods of little 

## apparent improvement. At times, a child may even regress in their learning—that is, lose skills they recently acquired 

## or even take a few steps back in their learning process. 

## Regression: ruling out physical causes 

## Regression during toilet training—a child’s sudden neglect of potty practices, constant "puddling" or other accidents, 

## or desire to return to diapers—can be baffling and upsetting to parents who believe they have nearly completed the 

## process. 

## Your first response when this happens should be to have them examined by their pediatrician to be sure the cause is 

## not physical. Regression sometimes signals an infection or other disorder that requires medical treatment. If medical 

## causes have been ruled out, however, your child is probably just responding in the only way they know how to a recent 

## change in their environment or some other source of stress in their life. 

## What causes a child to regress in potty training? 

## Common causes of potty training regression in young children include: 

## Change in the child-care routine—for example, a new sitter, or starting a child-care or preschool program 

## The mother’s pregnancy or the birth of a new sibling 

## A major illness on the part of the child or a family member 

## A recent death 

## Parents' marital conflict or divorce 

## An upcoming or recent move to a new home 

## Constipation/painful bowel movements 

## Urinary tract infection 

## Other medical problems 

## Big events—even when they are happy ones—can represent a real challenge to young children still struggling to 

## master their own personal routines. Just as you may choose to drop your diet or exercise routine during a difficult 

## period at work, your child may need to take some time off from toilet training to adjust to their new home situation. 

## Far from signaling an emotional problem, regression can actually be a healthy way for a child to meet her emotional 

## needs at a time when life feels overwhelming.

## Tips to deal with potty training regression 

### When responding to regressive behavior during the training process, focus on taking the following steps to help get 

### your child back on track. 

### Identify the problem. Is there a good reason for your child's regression, such as a new sibling or other change in 

### their environment? As verbal as your toddler or preschooler may be, it is often not possible for children this age 

### to express what they are feeling. If the reason is not clear, contact your pediatrician to determine if there is a 

### more physical reason for the regression, such as constipation. 

### If there is no physical reason, let your child know that you’ve noticed their change in behavior—that they have 

### stopped using their potty, have been having a lot of accidents at the child-care center, or have been talking about 

### wearing diapers again. Ask them why this might be—because their potty is in a new bathroom in your new home 

### now, because the toilet at the child-care center is scary, or because their new baby brother wears a diaper and has 

### been getting so much attention lately? Listen to their response, and help them try to communicate any events 

### that are upsetting them, as well as their feelings about them. 

### Do what you can to fix the problem. If there are practical steps you can take to ease your child’s distress, do so 

### as soon as possible. Arrange for a special time to spend alone with your child (without her new sibling), 

### accompany them to the child-care center to talk with caregivers about how they can help your child keep up 

### their bathroom habits, or surround their potty in the new home with familiar objects from the old home. Ask 

### your child to think of ideas, too, on how to improve their situation. By helping them "own" their problem and its 

### resolution in this way, you will commit them to a more active role in correcting it. 

### Be clear about your expectations. Particularly for younger children, these expectations are largely nonverbal. 

### Have the potty readily available, for example, and sit them on it at times you think they are more liely to go. For 

### the older child, let them know you are you are fully confident that they will succeed and pee on the potty. Support 

### them with positive reinforcements, including hugs and praise, stickers on a chart, and an occasional pep talk as 

### they struggle to regain their footing. 

## Taking a break from potty training 

### If your child’s regression stretches on for a month or more, you may need to ask yourself whether they were ready to 

### be fully day-trained in the first place. There’s no harm in suggesting that you set the potty aside for a while if it’s clear 

### that this would be a big relief to your child. But this is an exception to the general rule that moving forward, however 

### gradually, is usually best. 

## How long do potty training regressions last? 

### Upsetting as regression can be to parents, it usually doesn’t last very long. In many cases, the child picks up where she 

### left off in toilet training after a few days or weeks.
