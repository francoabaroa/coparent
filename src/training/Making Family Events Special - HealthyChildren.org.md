# Making Family Events Special 

## How can we make family events like parties or vacations 

## more special? 

## Birthdays, anniversaries, holidays, weddings, and summer vacations these are special times in a 

## family's life and can create lasting memories. 

## However, as treasured and important as these events are, some families try to make too much of 

## them. Parents may try to turn each birthday party into the best one ever. Or they feel they have to 

## fulfill every wish on their children's gift lists. Inevitably, that kind of attitude creates anxiety and disappointment, since 

## few events turn out perfectly. 

## How To Make Parties More Special 

## Tell your child to draw up a list of things he wants so that you and others who plan to give him gifts have something to 

## choose from. Have him underline or indicate his top preferences in some other manner. This way, he will understand 

## from the beginning that he won't get everything on the list, and he won't be disappointed. And if you can, try to 

## surprise him with something not on his list. 

## If your family budget does not allow you to buy your child most of what he wants, do not feel guilty; instead, buy one or 

## two gifts that will mean the most, rather than a dozen that don't. Even if you can provide for your child's every wish, 

## some selectivity can teach him to set priorities and to learn values. 

## More important, spend time with and show your love for your child; this is much more significant and lasting than 

## material items. Remember that special events from family gatherings to attendance at school recitals are times to 

## demonstrate the specialness of the people you care about. 

## Family Vacations 

## A summer vacation needs careful planning, not only taking the children's input into account, but also paying attention 

## to how the adults want to spend it. Planning vacations is a good opportunity for families to sit down and talk together. 

## A family vacation needs to be everyone's vacation, and that may mean not going to the place that the children have put 

## at the top of their list. ("Dad and I have decided that we're not going to Disney World again; this summer, we're going to 

## a national park for some camping.") As long as your destination has something there for your children, you do not 

## necessarily have to go where they want to every year. 

## In making decisions about vacations, think back to the summers of your own childhood. What did you like most about 

## your family vacations? What do you wish you had done more often? The answers to these questions will help guide 

## you toward what may be important to your own child. More than anything, children remember that their vacations 

## took them to locations other than their home, that the family got to spend time together, and that there were long days 

## and memorable experiences they did not get to enjoy the rest of the year. 

## Finally, when planning your vacation, be realistic. Too often, parents try to squeeze too much into the vacation, and the 

## family ends up finding their time together stressful, not relaxing.
