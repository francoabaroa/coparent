# Kids & Tech: Tips for Parents in the Digital Age 

## In a world where children are "growing up digital," it's important to 

## help them learn healthy concepts of digital use and citizenship. 

## Parents play an important role in teaching these skills. 

## Tips from AAP to Help Families Manage 

## the Ever Changing Digital Landscape: 

## Make your own family media use plan. Media should work 

## for you and within your family values and parenting style. 

## When used thoughtfully and appropriately, media can 

## enhance daily life. But when used inappropriately or without 

## thought, media can displace many important activities such as face-to-face interaction, family-time, outdoor-play, 

## exercise, unplugged downtime and sleep. Make your plan at HealthyChildren.org/MediaUsePlan 

## (http://www.healthychildren.org/MediaUsePlan). 

## Treat media as you would any other environment in your child's life. The same parenting guidelines apply in 

## both real and virtual environments. Set limits (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/The-Benefits-of-Limiting

## TV.aspx); kids need and expect them. Know your children's friends (/English/family-life/work-play/Pages/what

## parents-can-do-to-support-friendships.aspx), both online and off. Know what platforms, software, and apps your 

## children are using, what sites they are visiting on the web, and what they are doing online. 

## Set limits and encourage playtime. Media use, like all other activities, should have reasonable limits. 

## Unstructured and offline play stimulates creativity. Make unplugged playtime a daily priority, especially for very 

## young children. 

## Screen time shouldn't always be alone time. Co-view, co-play and co-engage with your children when they are 

## using screens—it encourages social interactions, bonding, and learning. Play a video game with your kids. It's a 

## good way to demonstrate good sportsmanship and gaming etiquette. Watch a show with them; you will have the 

## opportunity to introduce and share your own life experiences and perspectives—and guidance. Don't just 

## monitor them online—interact with them, so you can understand what they are doing and be a part of it. 

## Be a good role model. Teach and model kindness and good manners online. Because children are great mimics, 

## limit your own media use. In fact, you'll be more available for and connected with your children if you're 

## interacting, hugging and playing with them rather than simply staring at a screen. 

## Know the value of face-to-face communication. Very young children learn best through two-way 

## communication. Engaging in back-and-forth "talk time" is critical for language development (/English/family

## life/Media/Pages/Parents-of-Young-Children-Put-Down-Your-Smartphones.aspx). Conversations can be face-to

## face or, if necessary, by video chat with a traveling parent or far-away grandparent. Research has shown that it's 

## that "back-and-forth conversation" that improves language skills—much more so than "passive" listening or one

## way interaction with a screen. 

## Limit digital media for your youngest family members. Avoid digital media for toddlers younger than 18 to 24 

## months other than video chatting. For children 18 to 24 months, watch digital media with them because they 

## learn from watching and talking with you. Limit screen use for preschool children, ages 2 to 5, to just 1 hour a day 

## of high-quality programing. Co-viewing is best when possible and for young children. They learn best when they 

## are re-taught in the real world what they just learned through a screen. So, if Ernie just taught the letter D, you 

## can reiterate this later when you are having dinner or spending time with your child. See Healthy Digital Media

##### Create tech-free zones. Keep family mealtimes (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/Food-and-TV-Not-a-Healthy

##### Mix.aspx), other family and social gatherings, and children's bedrooms screen free. Turn off televisions that you 

##### aren't watching, because background TV can get in the way of face-to-face time with kids. Recharge devices 

##### overnight—outside your child's bedroom to help him or her avoid the temptation to use them when they should 

##### be sleeping. These changes encourage more family time, healthier eating habits, and better sleep. 

##### Don't use technology as an emotional pacifier. Media can be very effective in keeping kids calm and quiet, but 

##### it should not be the only way they learn to calm down. Children need to be taught how to identify and handle 

##### strong emotions, come up with activities to manage boredom, or calm down through breathing, talking about 

##### ways to solve the problem, and finding other strategies for channeling emotions. 

##### Apps for kids – do YOUR homework. More than 80,000 apps are labeled as educational, but little research has 

##### demonstrated their actual quality. Products pitched as "interactive" should require more than "pushing and 

##### swiping." Look to organizations like Common Sense Media (http://www.commonsensemedia.org/) for reviews 

##### about age-appropriate apps, games and programs to guide you in making the best choices for your children. 

##### It's OK for your teen to be online. Online relationships are part of typical adolescent development. Social media 

##### can support teens as they explore and discover more about themselves and their place in the grown-up world. 

##### Just be sure your teen is behaving appropriately in both the real and online worlds. Many teens need to be 

##### reminded that a platform's privacy settings do not make things actually "private" and that images, thoughts, and 

##### behaviors teens share online will instantly become a part of their digital footprint indefinitely. Keep lines of 

##### communication open (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/communication-discipline/Pages/How-to

##### Communicate-with-a-Teenager.aspx) and let them know you're there if they have questions or concerns. 

##### Warn children about the importance of privacy and the dangers of predators and sexting. Teens need to 

##### know that once content is shared with others, they will not be able to delete or remove it completely, and includes 

##### texting of inappropriate pictures (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/the-new-problem-of-sexting.aspx). They 

##### may also not know about or choose not to use privacy settings, and they need to be warned that sex offenders 

##### often use social networking, chat rooms, e-mail, and online gaming to contact and exploit children. 

##### Remember: Kids will be kids. Kids will make mistakes using media. Try to handle errors with empathy and 

##### turn a mistake into a teachable moment. But some indiscretions, such as sexting, bullying (/English/family

##### life/Media/Pages/Cyberbullying.aspx), or posting self-harm images, may be a red flag that hints at trouble ahead. 

##### Parents must observe carefully their children's behaviors and, if needed, enlist supportive professional help, 

##### including the family pediatrician. 

##### Media and digital devices are an integral part of our world today. The benefits of these devices, if used moderately and 

##### appropriately, can be great. But, research has shown that face-to-face time with family, friends, and teachers plays a 

##### pivotal and even more important role in promoting children's learning and healthy development. Keep the face-to

##### face up front, and don't let it get lost behind a stream of media and tech.
