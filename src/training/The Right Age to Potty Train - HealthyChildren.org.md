# The Right Age to Potty Train 

## One skill children need to learn is when and how to use 

## the toilet. Here are general potty training tips that can 

## help you begin the process. If your children have 

## special health care needs, some tips may need to be 

## modified. Talk with your child's doctor if you need 

## specific guidance. 

## Learning to use the toilet 

## Potty training is a process that involves the body and 

## the mind. 

## First, children need to be aware of their own 

## bladder and bowel signals. They need to learn when their bodies are signaling them that it's time to urinate or 

## have a movement. In general, children show signs of bladder and bowel control between 18 and 24 months of age. 

## Second, children need to learn how to use the toilet. Children must be able to understand instructions and follow 

## them. For instance, they have to be able to sit or stand comfortably. They have to be able to pull down their pants 

## and underpants, as well as pull them back up. 

## Third, once children have bladder and bowel control and they know how to use the toilet, they need to be willing 

## to use it. Toilet training struggles happen when children choose not to use the toilet. It's important to remember 

## that children can succeed at using the toilet but in their own time. 

## When to start potty training 

## Toilet training may come up during children's 18-month, 2-year, 2½-year, and 3-year well-child visits. The average age 

## toilet training begins in the United States is between 2 and 3 years of age. Most children in the United States are bowel 

## and bladder trained by 4 years of age. However, toilet training can begin as soon as parents and children want to start. 

## In general, here are signs a child may be developmentally ready to begin the toilet training process. If you have any 

## questions or concerns, talk with your child's doctor. 

## Is dry at least 2 hours at a time during the day or is dry after naps 

## Shows signs they are about to pee or poop, like grunting, freezing, or squatting 

## Can follow simple instructions 

## Can walk to and from the bathroom and help undress themselves 

## Does not like to be in wet diapers and wants to be changed 

## Asks to use the toilet or potty-chair 

## Asks to wear "big-kid" underwear 

## Potty training tips 

## Here are toilet training tips to help start the process. Parents can help empower their children to be in control of their 

## own toilet training. 

## 1. Keep the process positive. Choose the words your family will use to describe body parts, urine, and bowel 

## movements. Avoid words that are negative, like dirty, naughty, or stinky. 


### 2. Pick a potty-chair. A potty-chair is a child-sized seat with an opening in the seat and a removable container 

### underneath to collect pee and poop. Children's feet should be able to reach the floor. Books or toys for "potty 

### time" may help make this time more fun. 

### 3. Be a role model. Let your children see you use the toilet and wash your hands afterward. 

### 4. Know the signs. When your children feel the urge to poop, you might notice grunting, squatting, or freezing. 

### Children's faces may turn red while pooping. Explain briefly to your children that these signs mean a poop is 

### about to come. If your children tell you about a wet diaper, praise them for "using their words." It may take longer 

### for children to notice the need to pee than the need to poop. 

### 5. Think of toilet training as toilet mastery. Invite your child to take over their toileting. Talk with them about 

### how they will now be in charge of their pee and poop. Read children's books about using the toilet to help the 

### process make sense and seem inviting and exciting. When you start the process, try to turn as much of the care 

### of toileting as possible over to your child. Remember, if parents are in charge, there is less room for children to 

### step in and take charge. 

### 6. Make trips to the potty-chair a routine. Routines are important, and practicing the steps is helpful. Make a 

### habit of seating your children onto the potty-chair first thing in the morning. Boys can urinate by sitting down 

### first and can stand up to urinate when better at it. 

### 7. Expect hesitancy. Taking over toileting is a big step. Many children want their parents to take care of their pee 

### and poop and may seek ways to keep parents involved, such as peeing and pooping into their pants. Gently help 

### them overcome their hesitation. Then help them stay in charge by having them be in charge of the cleanup. 

### 8. When toilet training starts, switch to big-kid underwear. Talk with your children about taking control and 

### toileting into the toilet and not their underwear. Some parents may use cloth training pants, which are a little 

### thicker, to protect children's clothing. (Diapers and disposable training pants send a message to children that 

### they are not taking over and do not need to learn to use the toilet.) 

### 9. Teach your children proper hygiene habits. Show your children how to wipe carefully. Girls should spread 

### their legs apart when wiping. They should wipe thoroughly from front to back to prevent bringing germs from 

### their rectum to their vagina or bladder. Make sure both boys and girls learn to wash their hands well after using 

### the toilet. 

### 10. A word on praise. Taking over toileting is something all healthy children do. Achieving mastery is the best 

### reward for toilet training success. Avoid treats and punishments. Because this is an adventure for your children 

### —a reach for new responsibility— treats and punishments distract rather than encourage. When your children 

### succeed, be specific about why you are proud—"I am so proud you are able to use the toilet so well," for example. 

### 11. Avoid a power struggle. Children at toilet training ages are becoming aware of their individuality. They look for 

### ways to test their limits. Some children may do so by holding back bowel movements. Try to stay calm about 

### toilet training. Remember that children control when and where they pee and poop. So power struggles, begging, 

### pleading, rewarding, and punishing keep children from managing their own toileting. 

### 12. Understand their fear. Some children believe that their pee and poop are part of their bodies. They may be 

### scared the toilet will flush parts of them away. Some may also fear they will be sucked into the toilet if it is flushed 

### while they are sitting on it. To give your children a feeling of control, let them flush the toilet. 

### 13. Watch for a desire to move up. Most of the time, your children will let you know when they are ready to move 

### from the potty-chair to the "big toilet." Provide a stool to brace their feet. 

## When potty training should be put on hold 

### Major changes in the home may make toilet training more difficult. Sometimes it is a good idea to delay toilet training 

### if 

### Your family has just moved or will move in the near future. 

### You are expecting a baby or have recently had a baby. 

### There is a major illness, a recent death, or some other family crisis.

## Remember 

### If any concern comes up before, during, or after toilet training, talk with your child's doctor. Often, the problem is 

### minor and can be resolved quickly. Sometimes, physical or emotional causes will require treatment. Getting 

### professional help can make the process easier. If your child needs additional care, your child's doctor may suggest 

### another pediatric health care specialist who can address the specific pediatric needs of your child.
