# How to Have a Family Meeting 

## Weekly family meetings are an effective and enjoyable 

## way to bring the family together and improve 

## communication. You can use this time to set weekly 

## goals, recognize and reward progress, and determine 

## each member's needs and feelings. 

## Here are some tips to keep in mind: 

## 1. Hold your family meetings at a regular, pleasant 

## time—after dinner, for example. 

## 2. Serve as a discussion leader and make sure that 

## any ground rules are clearly explained and 

## understood. 

## 3. Make sure the meetings emphasize both individual and family needs, goals and accomplishments. Discuss 

## positive events and efforts. During the meeting, you can give allowances and praise and reward behavior 

## progress and changes. Share other relevant family information, such as an upcoming family vacation or school 

## event to prepare for. 

## 4. Let each family member speak without criticism or interruption. Each person should share their thoughts, 

## feelings, achievements and hopes. 

## 5. Don't dwell on the past. Remember that the meeting is not a time or place to scold, punish, recall past mistakes, 

## blow off steam or single out a particular person. Those issues should be taken up separately and individually. 

## 6. The meetings should last no more than 20 or 30 minutes unless your family wants to continue. 

## 7. Everyone should understand and accept that parents have the final word in difficult decisions. 

## 8. Keep a record should be kept of the main points, rewards, progress toward goals, new goals and agreements. 

## 9. Before the meeting ends, anyone who wants to should have a chance to say how they think the meeting went. 

## Ask what might be done to make the next meeting better.
