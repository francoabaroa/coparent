# Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS): Common 

# Questions & Concerns 

## By: Lanre O. Falusi, MD, MEd, FAAP 

## Of all the issues I've discussed with parents of infants 

## over the years, I have to say that sudden, unexplained 

## death is one of the hardest. 

## Every year, more than 3,000 babies in the U.S. die of 

## sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and other causes 

## that are unclear at first, including accidental 

## suffocation or strangulation. The shock, grief, and guilt 

## felt by families who lose an infant can be crushing. 

## Here are questions parents and caregivers often ask 

## about SIDS, along with the insights from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) that can help you address and 

## reduce your baby's risks of dying from SIDS. 

## What exactly is SIDS? 

## SIDS is the unexplained death of a seemingly healthy baby less than a year old. Most of these deaths occur while 

## babies are sleeping, which is why we also call these deaths "sleep-related deaths." In the past, SIDS was sometimes 

## called "crib death," but most of these deaths do not occur in cribs. 

## Why is it unsafe for a baby to sleep on their stomach? 

## Research suggests that SIDS may be caused by defects in the part of an infant's brain that controls breathing and the 

## ability to wake up. If a baby is not getting enough oxygen, it is important for the baby to wake up. This is probably why 

## stomach sleeping is dangerous. Babies who sleep on their stomachs sleep more deeply, and it's harder for them to 

## wake up if they are not getting enough oxygen. 

## Does SIDS run in families? 

## Experts are still working on understanding this, but we know that little ones whose siblings or cousins died of SIDS 

## face higher risks of dying from SIDS. 

## Are there other risks (/English/tips-tools/ask-the

## pediatrician/Pages/are-some-babies-at-higher-risk-for-sids.aspx) I 

## should know about? 

## Low birth weight and being born preterm can increase the risk for SIDS since a smaller or preterm infant's brain 

## might not be mature enough to control breathing and heart rate, especially during sleep. 

## Twins, triplets, and other multiple births also have higher risks since they may be born with low birth weight and 

## preterm. 

## Are parents to blame for some SIDS deaths? 

## When talking about SIDS, we should NEVER force blame, shame, judgment, or guilt on anyone. SIDS can happen to any 

## family, as we can see from stories like this one (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/Safe-Sleep-Charlies

## Story.aspx). 


### Babies who die likely have a problem with waking up when they are not getting enough oxygen. When this is coupled 

### with sleep situations where babies don't get enough oxygen (such as sleeping on the stomach or side; sleeping with 

### other people; sleeping with blankets, pillows, and other soft bedding; sleeping with the head elevated or on an inclined 

### surface), the baby can die. This is the basis for the safe sleep guidelines every family can follow. Here are updated 

### guidelines (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/A-Parents-Guide-to-Safe-Sleep.aspx) shared earlier this year by 

### the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). 

## How do the AAP safe sleep guidelines help families reduce SIDS 

## risks? 

### If you're caring for an infant under a year old, I hope you'll study the full guidelines—but let's start with some 

### highlights. First, babies should always sleep on their backs. Infants who sleep on their tummies or sides may have 

### trouble getting enough oxygen and trouble waking up, so parents and caregivers should follow the "back to sleep" rule 

### at naptime and nighttime. 

### We also know that placing babies for sleep on a firm, flat surface that meets CPSC safety standards (like a crib, 

### bassinet, or play yard) protects them from SIDS. Little ones should never sleep on a fluffy comforter, a couch or 

### armchair, a waterbed, or padded play spaces like baby nests, since soft surfaces can easily block their noses and 

### airways. Your baby's sleep space should also be kept 100% free of pillows, blankets, bumper pads, plush toys, and other 

### soft objects that can block breathing. 

### Overheating has been linked with higher SIDS risks, so your child's room should be kept at a temperature that is 

### comfortable. In warmer conditions, parents and caregivers should check for sweating, a hot chest, or flushed skin—all 

### signs that babies are suffering from heat distress. 

## Should I bring my baby into my own bed so I can watch over them? 

### No, this is one thing you should NEVER do. Bed-sharing has caused countless infant deaths, which can happen when 

### adults or bigger siblings shift during sleep, trapping a little one in an unsafe position. The pillows and blankets we use 

### on our own beds can also block infants' breathing. In fact, the AAP states unequivocally that there is no safe way to 

### sleep with your baby on the same bed, chair, couch or other surface. I hope this is one rule you'll follow every time. 

## Is there a safe way to monitor my infant, especially at night? 

### You can sleep in the same room with your infant for at least the first six months, which makes it much easier for you to 

### feed, soothe and keep track of them. You don't have to move into the nursery, of course! Instead, most parents place a 

### crib, bassinet, cradle, or play yard outfitted with a firm mattress in their own bedroom. Room sharing reduces SIDS 

### risks by as much as 50%, so it's well worth the extra effort. 

## Does breastfeeding protect babies from SIDS? 

### It does! Feeding your baby human milk for at least 2 months reduces your baby's risk of SIDS by at least 50%. This may 

### be because infants who consume only human milk may wake more easily and often than formula-fed infants. These 

### frequent awakenings are protective for the baby. 

### The immune boost that breastfeeding gives your child may also play a role in safe sleep. Here are more reasons the 

### AAP recommends feeding only breast milk to your child (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Where

### We-Stand-Breastfeeding.aspx) for at least the first six months, and longer if you wish. 

## Does smoke exposure increase a baby's chances of dying from SIDS? 

### Studies show that smoking even 1 cigarette per day while pregnant doubles the risk of SIDS.Exposing babies to 

### secondhand smoke after they're born will also elevate their chances of dying from SIDS. There are many possible 

### reasons for this, including the fact that children exposed to secondhand smoke suffer from more colds and 

### respiratory problems than those living in smoke-free homes. Also, one in five babies born to people who smoked 

### during pregnancy will have low birth weight, another risk factor for SIDS. 

### For their health and safety, NEVER smoke near your baby. This includes vaping and e-cigarettes, which contain 

### nicotine. You can learn more about the health benefits of protecting your child from secondhand smoke here

## Are there special devices that can help prevent SIDS? 

### Yes, but the best is also the simplest. Using a pacifier (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21505778/) has been shown to 

### protect little ones from SIDS while offering soothing comfort, making this a double win! If you're breastfeeding, wait 

### until your baby is latching on well and has started to gain weight before introducing a pacifier. Formula-fed infants 

### can take a pacifier anytime. Don't worry if your baby spits it out at first, since you can always try again later. 

### As for other devices, I would strongly suggest you NOT use a home heart monitor in hopes of reducing your child's 

### risks for SIDS. There is no evidence that these tools actually help, and they aren't required to meet the same safety 

### standards that medical devices do. Worse yet, using a heart monitor can give you a false sense of security. It's much 

### better to rely on the safe sleep guidelines, which are based on carefully conducted research we know we can trust. 

## How can I help a parent who's lost a child to SIDS? 

### There is no way I can convey how hard it can be for these families, who often believe they caused their child's death. 

### The best way to support them is to show compassion with zero judgment or shame. Never invoke a so-called silver 

### lining by saying that "this too shall pass," or suggesting that parents can find comfort in their other children. 

### If you have no idea what to say (which most of us don't), keep it simple: "I can't imagine the pain you are feeling right 

### now, but I truly care about you." You might offer to handle household chores or watch other children to help grieving 

### parents rest and recover. 

## Remember, your pediatrician is ready to help you 

### If you have questions about SIDS or any infant health topic, your pediatrician is as close as your phone. Call or email 

### them for support, insights and guidance anytime.
