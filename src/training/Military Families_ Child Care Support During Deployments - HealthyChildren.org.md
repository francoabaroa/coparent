# Military Families: Child Care Support During Deployments 

## For your family, it may be that frequent moves have made it harder for children to know 

## grandparents and other relatives. On the other hand, these family members may play a vital 

## supportive role to your children during deployments (/English/healthy-living/emotional

## wellness/Pages/Deployment-and-Children.aspx) and will have the opportunity to forge close 

## lifelong relationships. 

## If extended family will play a greater role in caring for your child during deployment than 

## they did previously, there are key things to keep in mind to allow smoother transitions. 

## Planning Ahead = Smoother Transition 

## Try to make transitions between caregivers go as smoothly as possible. For example, grandmother may arrive in 

## advance of the deployment so she will represent continuity and be associated with the loving nature of your home. 

## Beyond that, children will benefit by seeing that the temporary caregiver has genuine respect for the deployed parent. 

## If she arrives the day of departure, she may be associated with confusion or be viewed as a replacement. 

## No child will appreciate anyone replacing a parent, and that can breed unnecessary resentment. Fostering closeness 

## between your children and a temporary caregiver far in advance will make your children feel more secure. 

## Try to have the caregiver connect prior to deployment through visits, phone calls, or social media. If you will be 

## relocating to a family member’s home while your spouse is away, try to visit there prior to the move or, if that is not 

## possible, use digital photos to familiarize your children with the environment. 

## Communicating Your Plan to Your Children 

## Children and adolescents need to know "who will take care of me" and that the adults around them are sensitive to 

## their needs. You and your spouse should have a discussion with your children and caregiver. 

## The discussion should be targeted to the age of your children and should include 

## the following key points: 

## You have given a great deal of thought about who can best help to care for your children. 

## Explain why this person was chosen. Ideally, you should be able to say that you have chosen someone who also 

## loves your children. 

## Reinforce that this is temporary and that the caregiver does not replace the deploying parent. 

## The caregiver represents you and should be respected. 

## Explain that the distant parent will always be thinking of the children and will stay in contact whenever possible, 

## but because of distance will be unable to give the daily attention the children deserve. Because you care so much 

## for your children, you have carefully chosen someone who will do a good job of caring for those everyday needs. 

## Discussing Your Parenting Style with the Caregiver 

## You and your spouse should also find the opportunity to discuss your parenting approach with the caregiver. 

## It’s important that your children experience consistency of care rather than having to adjust to new approaches. You 

## should discuss parenting style, and the blend of control and rules with warmth and support. Ideally we strive for a 

## balance between rules and warmth, remembering that discipline means guidance, not control, but adults disagree 

## about these things. Even married couples don’t always see eye-to-eye on parenting style, but well-functioning 

## households do the best they can to disagree behind the scenes to present a united front to the children. When they 

## don’t, children learn to play parents off of each other. It’s important that you discuss this openly in advance so 

## children don’t receive confusing messages.

### If the temporary caregiver clearly understands your approach, hopefully she will remain as consistent as possible in 

### maintaining that approach. Don’t be surprised if your extended family member from a different generation holds a 

### different parenting philosophy than you do. She may be more lenient, or she may think you are too passive and she 

### would be stricter. This is all the more reason to work this through openly in advance. This will make the household 

### run more smoothly during deployment and hopefully prevent the returning service member from having to respond 

### to a 7-year-old shouting, "Grandma never told us what to do."
