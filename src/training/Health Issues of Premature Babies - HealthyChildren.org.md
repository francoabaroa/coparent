# Health Issues of Premature Babies 

## Because premature babies are born before they are physically 

## ready to leave the womb, they often have health problems. These 

## newborns have higher rates of disabilities (such as cerebral palsy 

## (/English/health-issues/conditions/developmental

## disabilities/Pages/Cerebral-Palsy.aspx)) and even death. African 

## Americans and Native Americans have the highest neonatal death 

## rate associated with prematurity. 

## Because of these health concerns, premature babies are given extra 

## medical attention and assistance immediately after delivery. 

## Depending on how early the baby has arrived, your pediatrician or 

## obstetrician may call in a neonatologist (/English/family

## life/health-management/pediatric-specialists/Pages/What-is-a-Neonatologist.aspx) (a pediatrician who specializes in 

## the care of premature or very ill babies) to help determine what, if any, special treatment the infant needs. 

## Here are some of the most common conditions that occur in premature infants. 

## Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) 

## What It Is: RDS is a breathing disorder related to the baby's immature lungs. It occurs because the lungs of 

## preterm babies often lack surfactant, a liquid substance that allows the lungs to remain expanded. 

## Treatment: Artificial surfactants can be used to treat these babies, along with a ventilator to help them breathe 

## better and maintain adequate oxygen levels in their blood. Sometimes, extremely preterm babies may need long 

## term oxygen treatment and occasionally may go home on supportive oxygen therapy. See When Baby Needs 

## Oxygen At Home (/English/ages-stages/baby/preemie/Pages/When-Baby-Needs-Oxygen-At-Home.aspx) for 

## more information. 

## Chronic Lung Disease/Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) 

## What It Is: BPD, or chronic lung disease, is a term used to describe babies who require oxygen for several weeks 

## or months. They tend to outgrow this uncommon condition, which varies in severity, as their lungs grow and 

## mature. 

## Apnea and Bradycardia 

## What It Is: Apnea (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/Sleep-Apnea-Detection.aspx) is a temporary pause 

## (more than fifteen seconds) in breathing that is common in preterm infants. It often is associated with a decline 

## in the heart rate, called bradycardia. A drop in oxygen saturation as measured by a machine called pulse 

## oximetry (/English/ages-stages/baby/preemie/Pages/Apnea-Monitors.aspx) is called desaturation. Most infants 

## outgrow the condition by the time they leave the hospital for home. 

## Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) 

## What It Is: ROP is an eye disease in which the retina is not fully developed. 

## Treatment: Most cases resolve without treatment, although serious cases may need treatment, including laser 

## surgery in the most severe instances. Your infant may be examined by a pediatric ophthalmologist 

## (/English/family-life/health-management/pediatric-specialists/Pages/What-is-a-Pediatric

## Ophthalmologist.aspx) or retina specialist to diagnose and, if needed, recommend treatment for this condition.

## Jaundice 

### What It Is: Jaundice (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/jaundice.aspx) happens when a chemical called bilirubin 

### builds up in the baby's blood. As a result, the skin may develop a yellowish color. Jaundice can occur in babies of 

### any race or color. 

### Treatment: Treating it involves placing the undressed baby under special lights (while her eyes are covered to 

### protect them). 

## Other Health Problems 

### Other conditions sometimes seen in preterm babies include anemia (/English/health

### issues/conditions/chronic/Pages/Anemia-and-Your-Child.aspx) of prematurity (a low red blood cell count) and heart 

### murmurs (/English/health-issues/conditions/heart/Pages/Heart-Murmur.aspx).
