# Bottle Feeding Basics 

## The most obvious difference between bottle-feeding (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding

## nutrition/pages/Bottle-Feeding.aspx)and breastfeeding (/English/ages

## stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/default.aspx) is that the bottle lets you see how much your baby 

## is drinking. Depending on what kind of parent you are, this may make you feel better because you 

## know what your baby is getting, or it may give you something new to obsess about. Whenever you 

## read guidelines for bottle-feeding, remember that each baby is different. Bigger babies need 

## more food. Your baby may go through a growth spurt and seem hungry all the time, and then she 

## may have a period when she eats less for a while. In general babies know how much food they 

## need to grow. If you attend to your baby’s hunger cues, she’ll tell you how much food she wants 

## and when she’s full. 

## Choosing A Bottle 

## Choosing a bottle can be as challenging as picking a formula. Manufacturers make all sorts of claims about their 

## nipples working more like the human breast or their bottles preventing gas. I haven’t seen good scientific literature 

## that supports these claims, so I can’t recommend one brand over another. 

## How Many Ounces? 

## Just like breastfed babies, bottle-fed newborns may start off slowly for 2 to 3 days, often taking only 1 to 2 ounces (30– 

## 60 mL) at a time. After the first 2 to 3 days of life she’ll probably be taking 2 to 3 ounces (60–90 mL) every 3 to 4 hours. 

## Sometimes your baby may sleep 4 to 5 hours between bottles, but she’ll need a lot of food over the first month or so of 

## life, so if she hasn’t awakened to eat after 5 hours it’s a good idea to go ahead and wake her up. You might even 

## consider waking her up after 3 or 4 hours during the daytime, hoping she’ll sleep a little longer at night. 

## After the first month of life (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/The-First-Month-Feeding-and

## Nutrition.aspx) your infant is likely to take around 4 ounces from the bottle every 4 hours or so, at least on average. 

## That intake rises gradually so that by age 6 months, she’ll take 6 to 8 ounces (180–240 mL) 4 or 5 times a day. Another 

## way to think about normal intake is by weight; for every pound of body weight, your infant will consume around 2½ 

## ounces (75 mL) per day. That said, every baby is different, and her doctor will weigh and measure her at each wellness 

## examination (/English/family-life/health-management/Pages/Well-Child-Care-A-Check-Up-for-Success.aspx) to 

## assess whether her growth is appropriate for her age. 

## Hunger Cues 

## Whether you’re breastfeeding or bottle-feeding, your baby will give the same cues to let you know when she’s hungry 

## and when she’s full. She will start rooting, scooting, sucking on her hand, and smacking her lips when she needs food. 

## She will release the nipple, turn away, and often fall asleep when she’s full. As she grows she may fall asleep less often 

## and instead look up and grin at you. You can be pretty confident at this point that the feeding is over, especially if she’s 

## letting formula drip on your pants. 

## Feeding FAQs 

## The 3 most common questions I answer about feeding, no matter the source, are: 

## “Is she getting enough?” 

## “Is she getting too much?” 

## “When will she stop waking up at night to feed?” 

## The first question we’ve already answered. As for too much, it’s rare for a baby to need more than about 7 or 8 ounces 

## per feeding or more than 36 ounces in a day. She may be sucking for comfort rather than hunger. As for the last 

## question, most babies will be able to make it through the night without feeding sometime between age 2 and 4 months 

## or when they weigh more than about 12 pounds. That really unfamiliar, energetic feeling you’ll have? It’s called a full

## night’s sleep.

## What You Can Do 

### More important than the type of bottle or nipple you use is how you position your baby when she eats. You’ll want to support her 

### in a semi-upright position, with her head cradled in the crook of your arm. Hold the bottle so that milk completely covers the 

### nipple; that way your baby isn’t swallowing air. Try not to bottle-feed your baby while she’s on her back. Lying down increases the 

### risk that she’ll choke, and it allows milk to run into her eustachian tubes, possibly causing middle ear infections 

### (/English/news/Pages/Middle-Ear-Infections.aspx). In the first few weeks of life you may have to gently touch the nipple to 

### her cheek to stimulate the rooting reflex. 

## When to Call the Doctor 

### Overfeeding often results in spitting up (/English/tips-tools/Symptom-Checker/Pages/Spitting-Up-Reflux.aspx) and 

### contributes to obesity (/english/health-issues/conditions/obesity/Pages/default.aspx). If your baby is taking more than 7 or 

### 8 ounces per feeding or more than 36 ounces a day, address it with her doctor.
