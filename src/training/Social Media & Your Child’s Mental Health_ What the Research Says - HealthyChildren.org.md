# Social Media & Your Childâ€™s Mental Health: What the 

# Research Says 

## By: Megan A Moreno, MD, FAAP & Jenny Radesky, MD, FAAP 

## Social media plays an important role in the lives of 

## many tweens and teens. Roughly 18% of 8to 12-year

## olds and 62% of 1318-year-olds reported using social 

## media sites such as Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, 

## Discord and Reddit every day 

## (https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/file 

## s/research/report/8-18-census-integrated-report-final

## web_0.pdf) in 2021. Among adolescents and young 

## adults, an estimated 90% use one or more social media 

## platforms. 

## All this media use can influence young people in a variety of ways. And with a reported rise in depression and anxiety 

## among teens (/English/ages-stages/teen/Pages/Mental-Health-and-Teens-Watch-for-Danger-Signs.aspx), you may 

## wonder how social media may impact your child's mental health. Research suggests it depends on how they use it. 

## Understanding potential connections between social media and mental health can help you guide your kids toward 

## healthy social media habits. 

## Ways social media use may benefit mental health 

## Social connection. One of the ways kids use social media is for social connection. Sharing photos and comments on 

## social media platforms can help keep them in touch with peers and family who live far away, for example. Teens can 

## also join groups that represent aspects of their identities or interests, such as groups around sports, theater, music or 

## LGBTQ pride and support. 

## Learning. Another positive way adolescents use social media is to learn. They can explore and follow organizations 

## such as art museums, local park systems or recipe bloggers. Some platforms also allow them to create share their own 

## content. Adolescents have described sharing their own crafts, hobbies and art to their social media audience. 

## Risky ways teens may use social media 

## Overload. Using social media too much, though, can push out other important activities. Examples include being in 

## person with friends and family or getting enough sleep (/English/tips-tools/ask-the-pediatrician/Pages/My-teen-is

## having-more-trouble-falling-asleep.aspx). 

## Unhealthy content. Social media can also expose adolescents to content that is violent (/English/family

## life/Media/Pages/Virtual-Violence-Impacts-Childrens-Behavior.aspx), dangerous or inaccurate. Further, social media 

## can present idealized images of people that can lead to issues with body image for some teens. 

## Current evidence around social media and mental health: FAQs 

## Can more social media use lead to depression? 

## There have been a lot of news stories lately about whether too much social media use contributes to depression. 

## Some studies have found that young people who used more social media were more likely to report depression 

## symptoms. It is important to consider that these studies could not tell if more social media use was impacting 

## depression, or whether participants with depression already were using more social media. The cause-and-effect 

## relationship for social media and depression remains unclear.

##### There are also research studies that found no relationship 

##### between the amount of social media use and depression 

##### symptoms. In a few other studies, researchers found that 

##### there was a small effect on depression, but only with very 

##### high levels of social media use. 

##### All of these studies focus on the quantity of social media 

##### use; they do not address the different ways that each 

##### unique child may use social media. 

##### In 2020, a review article 

##### (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31951670/) 

##### summarized all of the studies over the past five years on 

##### social media and depression. This systematic review 

##### article is a very powerful type of study that allows an 

##### understanding of evidence across multiple studies over 

##### time. This article concluded that "most recent and 

##### rigorous studies report small associations that do not 

##### distinguish between cause and effect, and are unlikely to 

##### be of clinical or practical significance." 

### My child uses social media, but doesn't 

### post much. Does that make a 

### difference? 

##### Another important consideration about social media and 

#### mental health is how your child uses social media. 

##### Passive or active use? Some studies show that teens who 

##### use social media in a passive way, such as by scrolling and 

##### looking at content as it goes by on the screen, had a higher 

##### likelihood of feeling depression symptoms. These studies 

##### also found that adolescents who used social media in a 

##### more active way, such as by liking or commenting on 

##### people's posts, or making their own posts and sharing 

##### them, did not have negative impact on mental health. 

##### These studies suggest that it is not just quantity of time a 

##### child spends on social media, but the quality of time using 

##### social media. 

### What are some other factors that may 

### play a role in how social media affects mental health? 

##### Different levels of risk. Newer research studies are teaching us that not all adolescents use social media in the same 

##### way. We're also learning that some kids may be at risk for negative consequences while others may not. This approach 

##### in research is called "differential susceptibility." What this means is that adolescents have unique combinations of 

##### risks and strengths that they bring to, and that impact, their social media use. 

#### The role of parents. A recent study (https://pediatrics.jmir.org/2022/2/e35540) looked at technology use and possible 

##### links to health and well-being behaviors, mental health and parenting. Two-thirds of adolescents in the study were 

##### doing well with their technology use and mental health. This group was called "Family-Engaged Teens," since they 

##### reported good communication with their parents about technology use. Their parents also had low levels of their own 

##### social media use. 

##### The smaller one-third group of teen participants had higher rates of negative health outcomes such as depression and 

##### loneliness. This group was called "At Risk Teens." This group of teen participants reported higher rates of social media 

##### use by their parents, as well as less frequent communication with their parents about their social media use. 

#### Another recent study found that adolescents who had higher depression symptoms reported that their parents spent 

#### up to 8 hours a day on social media. These studies highlight the important and positive role parents can play by: 

##### communicating with their children about social media, and 

##### serving as role models in monitoring their own social media use.

## How to encourage healthy social media habits for your whole family 

##### Here are steps you can take to help promote positive social media use for your child: 

##### Establish a Family Media Plan (/English/fmp/Pages/MediaPlan.aspx) for rules about social media use. Make sure 

##### that you are also following rules and role modeling healthy use for the family. 

##### Have conversations with your child about their media use, including how they are using these platforms. What 

##### do they like about them? Have they seen anything concerning? Make this an ongoing conversation. 

##### If you as a parent use social media, be sure to role model positive actions. For example, you can put away your 

##### phone at important family times such as during dinner, or during family time. 

##### Be cautious about children under 13 years old using social media. Most platforms set 13 as the minimum age to 

##### sign up. 

## Remember 

##### If you're concerned about your child's mental health, be sure to talk (/English/healthy-living/emotional

##### wellness/Pages/How-to-Talk-with-Your-Child-and-Their-Pediatrician-About-Mental-Health-Concerns.aspx) with 

##### your pediatrician.
