# Medication Safety Tips for the Breastfeeding Mom 

## If you are breastfeeding and plan to take any kind of drug—whether 

## prescription or over-the-counter—be sure to discuss with your 

## doctor or your child's pediatrician. While many medications are 

## safe during breastfeeding, a few can have serious side effects for 

## you and/or your baby—and they are not necessarily the same ones 

## that were most concerning during pregnancy. 

## What the AAP Recommends 

## Much is still unknown regarding long-term effects of various 

## kinds of medications on your baby. For this reason, while you 

## are breastfeeding, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 

## recommends to take medication only when absolutely necessary, and to take the lowest dose for the shortest 

## time possible. 

## Is your medication short-acting or long-acting? 

## When possible, use short-acting medications (those eliminated by your body quickly) rather than longer-acting 

## medication. Short-acting medicines are best taken immediately after a nursing session, while longer-acting 

## medicines should be taken just before your baby's longest sleep period. When a short-acting medication is taken 

## immediately after a nursing session, there is a good chance that much of it will already be out of your body's 

## system by the time your baby is ready to nurse again. 

## Watch for reactions in your baby: 

## When taking any medication, watch closely for reactions (/English/ages

## stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Infant-Allergies-and-Food-Sensitivities.aspx) in your baby, including loss of 

## appetite, diarrhea, sleepiness, excessive crying, vomiting, or skin rashes. Call your baby's pediatrician 

## immediately if any of these symptoms appear. 

## When to express and store your milk: 

## If your doctor needs to prescribe a potentially harmful drug for a short time, you may express and store your 

## milk (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Storing-and-Preparing-Expressed-Breast-Milk.aspx) until 

## the medication is cleared from your body. The length of time required to clear the drug from your system varies 

## based on the particular medication, but your doctor can advise you about this. Pumping and discarding breast 

## milk exposed to medication is rarely indicated. It is recommended that you have a discussion with both your 

## doctor and a lactation consultant prior to discarding any milk. 

## Birth Control 

## Frequent, exclusive breastfeeding ( no water, juice, formula, solid foods, or other supplements for the baby), including 

## at least one night feeding, may delay your chances of becoming pregnant during the first six months after birth. 

## However, after about six weeks, especially if you are only partially breastfeeding, you can begin using contraceptives if 

## your milk supply is firmly established. You should discuss the issue with your doctor. 

## While there are no harmful effects on infants when mothers use birth control (/English/ages

## stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/birth-control-and-breastfeeding.aspx), research has shown that birth control 

## pills with high doses of estrogen may decrease milk supply (/English/ages

## stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Decreased-Milk-Supply.aspx).

### Progestin-only pills (sometimes referred to as mini-pills) are least likely to interfere with breastfeeding, although 

#### they have increased side effects for the mother. 

#### Consider using condoms, a diaphragm, or a cervical cap and spermicide instead, since these forms of birth 

#### control are least likely to interfere with your milk supply. 

## Homeopathic & Herbal Medicines 

#### While many homeopathic and herbal remedies are generally safe, some remedies may be harmful for breastfeeding 

#### women and infants. In many cases, very little scientific research has been done regarding the implications of using 

#### such treatments while nursing. 

#### The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not regulate (/English/health

#### issues/conditions/treatments/Pages/FDAs-Role-in-the-Drug-Approval-Process.aspx) homeopathic, herbal, or natural 

#### remedies. Therefore, there is no nationally approved oversight safety. When taken in large quantities, certain 

#### substances create negative effects such as increased blood pressure and reduced milk supply. It's safest to refrain 

#### from taking herbs or other homeopathic medications before discussing with your doctor first. 

#### If a homeopathic or herbal remedy must be taken, the same recommendations apply as with any other 

#### medication: take the smallest dose possible, and always take right after a nursing to minimize medication 

#### amounts in your breast milk. 

## Remember... 

#### Always make sure that your doctor is aware of any medications you are taking while you are breastfeeding. 

#### Communication is important for optimizing the safety of both you and your baby.
