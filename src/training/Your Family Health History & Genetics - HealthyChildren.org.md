# Your Family Health History & Genetics 

## It is important for parents to learn as much as they can about their family health history in order 

## to have a complete record for your child throughout his or her life. 

## Family Health History Plays a Major Role In: 

## Identifying familial and hereditary disorders 

## Determining inheritance patterns and recurrence risks for known and suspected genetic 

## disorders 

## Identifying those at risk for a genetic disorder 

## Identifying those not at risk for a genetic disorder 

## Providing information necessary for appropriate genetic counseling 

## Providing an important adjunct to patient management of all childhood diseases, such as growth problems 

## (/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/puberty/Pages/When-a-Child-is-Unusually-Short-or-Tall.aspx) and asthma 

## (/English/health-issues/conditions/allergies-asthma/Pages/Asthma.aspx) 

## Ideally a family history is recorded at your child first visit to the pediatrician, as well as a mother’s first prenatal visit. A 

## family history should also be updated yearly with each well-child visit (/English/family-life/health

## management/Pages/Well-Child-Care-A-Check-Up-for-Success.aspx). 

## Questions Your Pediatrician May Ask About Family History: 

## Are there any health problems that are known to run in your family, or that close relatives have been told are 

## genetic? If so, what are these conditions? 

## Is there anyone in the family who had cancer, heart disease, or other adult-onset health problem at an early age, 

## such as between 20 and 50? 

## Does/did anyone in the family have intellectual disability (/English/health-issues/conditions/developmental

## disabilities/Pages/Intellectual-Disability.aspx), learning problems (/English/health-issues/conditions/learning

## disabilities/Pages/What-are-Learning-Disabilities.aspx), or have to go to a special school? 

## Have there been any early deaths in the family, including stillbirths, infant deaths, multiple miscarriages, or 

## shortened life span? 

## What is your ethnic background? Some genetic conditions are more common in certain geographic, ethnic, and 

## racial groups. 

## Have any relatives had extreme or unexpected reactions to medications or therapy? 

## Barriers to Collecting a Family History 

## According to a survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, although 96.3% of Americans considered 

## knowledge of family history important to their personal health, only about 30% have ever tried to actively gather and 

## organize their families’ health histories. 

## Barriers for families to collecting a family history include: 

## Lack of time 

## Incomplete records 

## Inaccessible family members 

## Adoption (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/adoption-and-foster-care/Pages/Questions-About-Biological

## Parents.aspx) 

## Incorrect or vague diagnoses 

## Denial or guilt 

## Family members not talking to each other 

## Blame 

## Multiple family members who care for a child
