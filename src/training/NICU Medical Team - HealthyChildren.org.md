# NICU Medical Team 

## Your baby may have more medical professionals than you have encountered in your entire 

## lifetime. In every NICU, a member of the medical team is present in the NICU 24 hours a day, and 

## a neonatologist is always on-call for that unit. 

## Neonatologist 

## A neonatologist is a physician who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of sick newborns. 

## Neonatologists have 3 years of specialized training, specifically to treat newborns, beyond that 

## required for general pediatricians. The neonatologist is usually the most knowledgeable member 

## of the team treating your newborn and directs the medical care of your baby. The lead physician in most NICUs is a 

## neonatologist and, in the hierarchy of the medical team, is referred to as the attending physician. 

## The neonatologist’s availability varies from NICU to NICU. In some units, care is directed by a team of neonatologists. 

## That team then shares the responsibility for providing care on a 24-hour basis with a different member of the team 

## being responsible for your baby’s care each day. In other facilities, especially in large centers that are also accredited 

## for training the next generation of neonatologists or pediatricians, the neonatologist may be present in the unit for 

## only a portion of each day (and will usually be present during patient rounds). During rounds, members of the health 

## care team discuss and review your baby’s current condition and determine a medical plan of care. The neonatologist 

## makes recommendations to ensure that the NICU team provides the best care for your infant based on a daily plan. If 

## unexpected problems arise, the neonatologist is available to the health care team 24 hours a day. 

## The neonatologist is responsible for overseeing the medical decisions regarding your baby. The attending 

## neonatologist may also supervise other physicians, some of whom are in varying levels of their professional training, 

## including residents, and fellows. In many large centers the medical team is supported by clinical directors or chiefs of 

## the NICU who may not have direct care of your child at all times but who work with the entire team of neonatologists 

## as well as the nurse managers to oversee the general operations of the whole unit. 

## Neonatal Nurse Practitioner 

## An NNP or advanced registered nurse practitioner (ARNP), also called an advanced practice registered nurse, or 

## APRN, is an RN who has completed advanced education and training in the care and treatment of newborns and their 

## families. In most institutions, a nurse practitioner must have a master’s degree in nursing. Working in collaboration 

## with a neonatologist or attending physician, the NNP is an expert in neonatal resuscitation; examines, diagnoses, and 

## designs a care plan for your baby; and serves as an education resource for all members of the NICU team. The NNP 

## may also perform procedures such as intubation, central line placement, chest tube insertion, and lumbar puncture. 

## In most US states, NNPs (and ARNPs or APRNs) may prescribe medications. 

## Neonatal Physician Assistant 

## A neonatal physician assistant (NPA) is a specialist who has earned a certificate or degree from an accredited school 

## and passed a state licensing examination. An NPA has the same general background as other physician assistants, but 

## has completed education and training in the care and treatment of infants and their families. The NPA works under 

## the supervision of a neonatologist or attending physician. An NPA performs delivery room resuscitation and has been 

## trained to assess, diagnose, and design a care plan for your baby. The NPA may also perform procedures such as 

## intubation, central line placement, chest tube insertion, and lumbar puncture and may serve as an education resource 

## for members of the NICU team. An NPA may prescribe medications in most US states. 

## Hospitalist 

## A pediatric hospitalist is a physician who has completed a pediatric residency and has developed specific skills and 

## interest in caring for infants and children who require inpatient hospital care. Some hospitalists choose to spend part 

## or all of their time working in a NICU. Hospitalists work under the supervision of a neonatologist and are capable of 

## performing many of the procedures and care for babies in the NICU.

## Resident 

### A resident is a physician who has graduated from medical school and is enrolled in a hospital-based program of 

### specialized training called a residency program. Residency programs vary according to specialty (pediatrics, 

### obstetrics, surgery, and so on) and in the amount of time required to complete the training. Pediatric residencies 

### usually take 3 years to complete. A resident can be in his or her first year of training or a physician in the second or 

### third year of the program. You may also hear a resident called an R-1, R-2, or R-3 (denoting a first-, secondor third

### year resident) or PGY-1, PGY-2 or PGY-3 (for postgraduate year 1, 2, or 3) or PL-1, PL-2, or PL-3 (for post-licensure year 1, 

### 2, or 3). Most residents in the NICU are enrolled in pediatric residencies, but residents from other specialties, such as 

### family practice, anesthesia, or obstetrics, may be involved as well. Residents are usually very visible on the unit. They 

### are closely involved with your baby’s daily care as members of the medical team. Residents assess your infant daily, 

### then plan and revise the medical care. Residents perform many NICU procedures, such as intubation, placement of IV 

### and arterial lines, lumbar puncture, and chest tube insertion Resident teams may be composed of members in varying 

### years of their residency training; often senior residents will help supervise junior residents. 

## Neonatal Fellow 

### A neonatal fellow is a physician who has completed medical school as well as a pediatric residency and is currently 

### training to become a neonatologist. The fellow works closely with the attending neonatologist and may be more 

### visible on the unit than the neonatologist. 

### Responsibilities of a fellow vary widely. In some units, a fellow may be there all day overseeing the daily plans for each 

### baby in the NICU and at delivery room resuscitations. In other units, the fellow makes rounds in the mornings and 

### provides consultation for residents, NNPs, and NPAs during the rest of the day or night. 

## Pediatrician 

### A pediatrician is a physician who has completed a pediatric residency and who provides medical care for children 

### from birth to 18 years (sometimes up to 21 years). In some hospitals, pediatricians with interest in the care of babies 

### with special needs may provide care for babies in the NICU. Other pediatricians may not have special training in NICU 

### care and may therefore refer your baby to a neonatologist. After your baby is discharged from the NICU, your 

### pediatrician commonly becomes your baby’s primary care provider. 

### Depending on the needs of your baby, a family practitioner may also be your baby’s primary care provider. 

## Other Medical Personnel 

### Your baby’s medical team may call on other specialists to assist them in providing care for your baby. These 

### consultants may be present in your hospital, available on an intermittent basis, or by telephone.
