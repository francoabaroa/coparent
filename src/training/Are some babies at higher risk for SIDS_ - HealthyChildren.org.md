## Question 

# Are some babies at higher risk for SIDS? 

## Michael Goodstein, MD, FAAP 

## Answer 

## Thousands of U.S. babies die suddenly and unexpectedly 

## each year, usually during sleep (/English/ages

## stages/baby/sleep/Pages/a-parents-guide-to-safe

## sleep.aspx). Sometimes, the cause is found, such as when 

## bedding or other items near them blocks breathing. 

## Other times, such as with sudden infant death syndrome 

## (SIDS), the exact cause can't be determined. But while we 

## don't yet know exactly what causes SIDS, also called 

## unexplained sudden death in infancy, there are some 

## risk factors we know about. 

## Types of SIDS risk factors 

## It important to know that risk factors are findings that are associated with an increased or decreased likelihood of 

## SIDS, but are not the cause of the death. Some risk factors, including many related to the sleep environment, can be 

## changed to lower your baby's risk. Other risk factors cannot be changed. 

## For example, babies who are born preterm (premature (/English/ages-stages/baby/preemie/Pages/default.aspx)) or 

## with a low birth weight (under 5 lbs. 8 oz.) are 2 to 3 times more likely to die of SIDS or other sleep-related deaths. We 

## also know that your baby is at higher risk if you smoked or drank alcohol during pregnancy. Recent research shows 

## that every cigarette smoked during pregnancy increases your baby's risk of SIDS. In fact, It has been estimated that, if 

## everyone stopped smoking during pregnancy, up to one-third of SIDS deaths could be avoided. 

## What other SIDS risk factors have been studied? 

## Interestingly, about 60% of the deaths occur in males and 40% in females. Age also plays an important role in SIDS and 

## sleep-related deaths. SIDS peaks between 1 and 4 months of age, and 90% of the cases take place in the first 6 months 

## of life. Suffocation and strangulation deaths in the sleep space also occur mostly in the first 6 months of life, but there 

## are different peaks based on the how the death occurred: overlays (suffocation when a larger person sleeps on the 

## baby, which can happen with bed-sharing) peak at 2 months; soft bedding deaths (when the baby's face and nose are 

## blocked by soft bedding) peak at 3 months, and wedgings (when a baby can't breathe because they are stuck between 2 

## hard surfaces, such as the bed and a wall) peak at 6 months. 

## Why don't we know what causes SIDS yet? 

## Researchers have been hard at work trying to unlock the secrets of SIDS for over 50 years, and much progress has 

## been made. But it is very hard to study when we can't predict these tragedies before they happen, and they mostly 

## occur while everyone is asleep. Our best working model is the Triple Risk Hypothesis, which proposes 3 factors in 


#### these deaths: 1) an underlying abnormality or immaturity in the baby's breathing or sleep waking systems, 2) a critical 

#### period of development (first months of life), and 3) environmental factors or stressors (such as stomach or side 

#### sleeping, overheating or covering the nose and mouth). Each death results from the interaction of multiple factors. 

#### For many of these tragic deaths, it seems that the baby cannot wake up or arouse enough to move their head when 

#### they are not getting enough oxygen. However, we also know that there are other reasons that these babies die. Up to 

#### 10% of SIDS deaths are due to sudden irregular heartbeats, some may be related to specific abnormalities in the brain. 

#### Some may be triggered by an abnormal immune response to infection. Still others may be related to seizures 

#### (/English/health-issues/conditions/seizures/Pages/default.aspx) and some may have a genetic component. 

## So, is there any test my baby can take to predict the risk of or prevent 

## SIDS? 

#### Unfortunately, there is no test to help predict or prevent SIDS at this time. Years ago, Italian researchers tried to use 

#### electrocardiograms (EKGs) to identify babies at risk for heart arrhythmias (/English/health

#### issues/conditions/heart/Pages/Irregular-Heartbeat-Arrhythmia.aspx)(irregular heartbeats), but this was not 

#### successful. The brain abnormalities that researchers have identified in some cases cannot be seen in advance using 

#### current technology. They can only be found at autopsy in specialized research facilities. 

#### Although there is no "SIDS gene," many genes have been identified that may play a role in certain SIDS cases. There 

#### are genes related to some cardiac arrythmias, others that affect brain chemicals (neurotransmitters) involved in sleep 

#### arousals (a baby's ability to wake up), and others that impact immune response to infection, to name a few. 

## What about the recent study saying researchers found a biomarker 

## for SIDS? 

#### Everyone desperately wants to find answers so we can prevent these tragedies from happening. So it's understandable 

#### how this report generated a lot of excitement. But the reality is that this was a small, preliminary study with promising 

#### results that need additional testing. Although there was a statistical difference in the AVERAGE levels of the tested 

#### chemical in the SIDS group vs. the control group, the RANGE of levels between the two groups had a lot of overlap. A 

#### good screening test must be able to clearly separate out those at risk from those who are not. This test cannot do this 

#### yet. 

## If there is no test for SIDS, what can I do now to keep my baby safe? 

#### The best thing you can do for your baby at this time is create a safe sleep environment to minimize the risk of SIDS 

#### and to prevent issues like suffocation. Babies are safest sleeping on the back, close to but separate from the parents 

#### (room sharing-not bed sharing) in an uncluttered crib, bassinet or play yard (no pillows, loose blankets, stuffed 

#### animals, etc.). There should be nothing in the sleep area but a firm, flat non-inclined mattress with fitted sheet. 

#### There are a number of other safe sleep recommendations that can help. These include having a smoke-free 

#### environment, letting your baby use a pacifier, keeping them up to date on recommended immunizations 

#### (/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Your-Babys-First-Vaccines.aspx), and breastfeeding or the use of 

#### human milk. Providing human milk to your baby for at least 2 months can decrease the risk of SIDS by 50%! 

## Remember 

#### Although the overall risk of SIDS is low--a little under 1 death per 1000 live births--this number is still much too high. 

#### Our SIDS rates in the United States are much higher than those of many other countries. As scientists continue to 

#### search for more information about how SIDS happens, try to minimize risk factors as much as possible to help prevent 

#### these tragic deaths. And don't hesitate to talk with your pediatrician about keeping your sleeping baby safe.
