# Nursing During Pregnancy 

## Women who become pregnant while breastfeeding an older child often wonder whether they 

## can continue nursing through pregnancy and after the new baby’s birth. The answer is a qualified 

## yes to both questions, depending on your medical history, your older baby’s responses, your own 

## feelings, and your milk supply. 

## Breastfeeding mothers who have miscarried previously or who have a history of premature 

## delivery should stay in touch with their obstetrician and report any uterine contractions, since 

## the nipple stimulation of breastfeeding may increase your risk of delivering too soon. Most often 

## there is no cause for greatconcern, but it’s important to be sensitive to your body’s signals. 

## After the first few months of pregnancy, your milk supply will probably diminish somewhat, and the taste of your 

## breast milk may change as well. Either of these changes may cause your baby to refuse the breast milk and eventually 

## wean himself. You may initiate weaning yourself if you experience too much nipple tenderness or physical 

## discomfort. If you and your older baby do continue breastfeeding, it is important to keep in mind that pregnancy and 

## breast milk production both require extra energy. Be sure to monitor your food intake as you prepare for childbirth 

## and get plenty of rest. 

## Breastfeeding both your older child and your infant, called tandem nursing, can in some cases ease your older child’s 

## adjustment to the new baby, address your own desire to maintain closeness with the older child, and even make child 

## care easier in some cases as both children are fed and comforted on the breast. Again, though, tandem breastfeeding 

## takes more energy than nursing a single child. 

## Keep in mind that the new baby’s breastfeeding needs are the most important at this time. Your infant urgently needs 

## the colostrum and immune-protective benefits more than your older child. To ensure that your infant receives 

## adequate milk, breastfeed her before nursing your older child and allow her breastfeeding needs to take top priority. A 

## one-year-old or toddler can make up for a decrease in breast milk with nutritious solid foods. When taking care of a 

## newborn or young infant and older children as well, be sure to wash your hands frequently to prevent germs passing 

## from one child to another.
