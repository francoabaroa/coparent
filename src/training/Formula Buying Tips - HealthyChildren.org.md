# Formula Buying Tips 

## Buying formula is a significant expense of parenthood. If you are so 

## inclined, here is a little list of ways you might save a bit along the 

## way. 

## Do the math. We realize that it's not always easy, fun, or 

## feasible, but it can be quite worthwhile to take the time and 

## figure out how much you're paying per ounce. You may be 

## surprised by what you find by comparing prices between 

## brands as well as by comparing types and sizes. Once you've 

## looked at the label and figured out how many total prepared 

## ounces you'll be getting in any given can or container, divide 

## the price by the total number of prepared ounces. Depending 

## on the retailer, the price per ounce may already be calculated and listed for your convenience right next to the 

## total price posted on the display shelf. 

## Stock up. To do this, you'll first want to make sure that your baby is perfectly content with the formula he's 

## getting. Then take advantage of any sales and coupons you may spot along the way. You'll want to remember to 

## check the expiration date printed on the cans before stocking up. While many will have expiration dates well 

## more than a year, you won't want to get stuck with a bunch of cans whose time will be up before you can use 

## them. 

## Save receipts. Early on it's more difficult to know for sure that the formula you buy now is going to be the 

## formula you buy forever after (i.e., through the end of the first year). While you're still settling in over the next 

## several weeks, we suggest tucking your receipts--for formula and all your other new-baby purchases--away 

## somewhere for safekeeping and easy retrieval.
