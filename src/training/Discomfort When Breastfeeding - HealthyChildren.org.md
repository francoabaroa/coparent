# Discomfort When Breastfeeding 

## I find that breastfeeding hurts a lot for the minute or so 

## after my baby latches on. I know how important 

## breastmilk is for her, but the initial pain makes me want 

## to give up. Will this situation change? 

## Some new mothers feel more discomfort than others during different aspects of the 

## breastfeeding process, and some women have more-sensitive nipples than others. Some feel, as you do, that the first 

## few suckles of a breastfeeding session are uncomfortable. 

## It may help to know that most of these sensations fade after the first couple of weeks of breastfeeding. Other mothers 

## dislike the feeling they experience as their milk lets down, but most mothers readily adjust to this brief “pins and 

## needles” sensation. 

## It would be a shame to give up breastfeeding because of temporary feelings of discomfort. Hang in there for at least a 

## week or two and then reassess how you feel. 

## If you have severe pain or discomfort that does not diminish as the baby settles into nursing, ask for help with latching 

## on and request pain medication, if needed, that’s safe to take when breastfeeding.
