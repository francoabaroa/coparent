# From Bottle to Cup: Helping Your Child Make a Healthy 

# Transition 

## By: Jennifer Shu, MD, FAAP 

## You've probably heard that when your baby is around 6 

## to 9 months old, it's time to begin moving away from 

## bottle feeding. But like many parents, you may feel a 

## little apprehensive about this next step in your child's 

## growth and development. 

## If your little one pouts, shouts or bursts into tears when 

## you offer them a "big kid cup," take a deep breath. 

## Protests like these are totally normal! After all, little 

## humans don't like letting go of familiar habits any more 

## than we do. And the comfort they get from sucking on a 

## warm bottle can be hard to give up. 

## Like all growth stages your child will pass through, this one takes patience and time. But there are many good reasons 

## not to give in when your child demands a bottle. 

## Why prolonged bottle feeding can cause health problems 

## Pediatricians and dentists stress the benefits of training your child to drink from a cup at mealtime as you gradually 

## reduce the number of bottle feedings. Ideally, this transition will begin around 6 months, when you offer your child a 

## cup for the first time. You will then reduce the number of bottle feedings slowly, completing the transition sometime 

## between 12 and 18 months. 

## Letting children bottle-feed longer than this can cause them to: 

## Skip meals. Little ones who sip on bottles during the day often don't feel hungry at mealtimes. This may mean 

## they're getting less of the fiber and rich nutrients found in solid foods. If you're begging your child to eat, bottles 

## might be the cause. 

## Reach an unhealthy weight. For many kids, bottles become high-calorie meal supplements and snacks, leading 

## to toddler obesity (/English/health-issues/conditions/obesity/Pages/childhood-obesity-a-complex-disease.aspx). 

## And while many people find chubby toddlers adorable, pediatricians point out that early obesity sets the stage for 

## weight (and health) problems later in life. 

## Develop cavities. Early childhood caries, sometimes called "baby bottle tooth decay" or baby tooth cavities, 

## happen when your child's teeth are constantly bathed in milk, formula, juice or other drinks. Little ones who 

## drink from bottles well into their second year may also have tooth alignment problems and even speech delays, 

## since little mouths need to strengthen the muscles for clear speech. 

## Resist even more. Toddlers cling to their bottles even more fiercely as time goes by. This can trigger a major 

## power struggle between you and your child, so starting early is the healthiest path for both of you. 

## Tips for a smoother transition to drinking from a cup 

## The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that you offer your child a cup when they start eating solid 

## foods, usually around 6 months. You can use a "sippy" (training) cup with a spouted lid or offer a cup and straw. Some 

## children may choose to drink from an open cup without a straw – and that's just fine, too. 


#### Sippy cups should be used only while little ones are learning. It's healthiest for kids to drink from an open 

#### cup by about 2 years of age. (If your child has a chronic illness, physical differences or shows signs of small motor 

#### skill delay, ask your pediatrician to help you put together a schedule that follows your child's abilities.) When 

#### your child is using a sippy cup, only fill them with plain fluoridated water without juice or sugar. 

#### Move away from the bottle gradually. When you begin weaning, tell your child they can drink from a bottle at 

#### mealtimes. Gradually eliminate bottle feedings at other times, especially naps or bedtime. Be ready to offer extra 

#### snuggles, songs or bedtime stories so your child feels reassured, but learns to self-soothe without a bottle. Giving 

#### your child plain water in bottles between meals and then moving to plain water in sippy cups or cups can help 

#### with the transition. 

#### Start offering a cup to your child as early as 6 months. Bring one to the table with your child's plate and 

#### encourage them to give it a try. Begin by putting formula or breast milk in their cup—whatever they're drinking 

#### already. (This might feel more natural than starting with water.) As they get the hang of things, you can fill their 

#### cup with plain water at mealtimes, too. 

#### Celebrate their success. Notice your little one's progress and offer them praise. If it feels right, put on party hats 

#### and sing a happy tune. Your child is eating and drinking like a big kid, which helps set the stage for lifelong 

#### health. Hooray! 

#### If your child balks, do a little investigating. Maybe they aren't thirsty when you offer them a mealtime drink, 

#### and that's okay. Model good habits by drinking water when you eat together. If they seem to need a little more 

#### attention, don't hold back. "Wow, you took a sip! Good job! I love seeing you drink from your big-kid cup." 

#### Bring everyone into the act. Let daycare providers, sitters, grandparents, siblings and friends know that your 

#### child is building a new skill. Other caregivers need to follow the same routine so your child can move forward. 

## Issues to watch for along the way 

#### Bottle weaning can be tricky, so it's smart to know some of the challenges that parents and caregivers sometimes face. 

#### Here are a few extra tips for you. 

#### Offer cups mainly at mealtime. Little ones who carry their cups around all day like security blankets may drink 

#### way too much (and need more frequent diaper changes). If your toddler is thirsty, offer them a little plain water, 

#### but then set the cup aside and remind them it will be there when it's time to eat. 

#### Trust your child to self-soothe without a bottle. Temporary sleep problems can turn into serious struggles if 

#### you give in to your child's protests and offer a bottle at bedtime. Create a healthy new routine when your little 

#### one can snuggle with you, listen to a story or soft music and drift off. A pacifier may also help. 

#### Offer healthy beverages. Plain water is the healthiest drink (https://www.mouthhealthy.org/en/nutrition/food

#### tips/water-best-beverage) for your child, and the fluoride in tap water helps prevent tooth decay. (If you're 

#### wondering how fluoride works and whether it's safe for kids, here's a helpful article 

#### (https://www.mouthhealthy.org/en/az-topics/f/fluoride).) 

#### Milk and juice contain natural sugars that deliver extra calories and increase cavity risks, so offer small 

#### portions. Avoid drinks with added sugar, especially carbonated beverages 

#### (https://www.mouthhealthy.org/en/nutrition/food-tips/sugary-drinks), which damage tooth enamel. 

#### As your child transitions to an open cup , place one next to the bathroom sink or water dispenser so they can 

#### serve themselves. Help them practice with the faucet or dispenser valve and offer praise for progress. (Another 

#### big-kid milestone to celebrate!) 

## Choosing the right cup for your child 

#### There are literally hundreds of choices out there, so this can be confusing. Many sippy cups have a valve under the 

#### spout to stop spills. But kids have to suck to get any liquid from them, which is just like drinking from a baby bottle. 

#### Not at all helpful for learning and development! 

#### If you prefer a sippy cup rather than an open cup (with or without straw), choose one with no valve. It should have a 

#### snap-on or screw-on lid with a simple spout. Opt for one with two handles to help little hands get a grip. Some cups 

#### have a weighted base that pulls them upright when they tip—great for minimizing spills. But remember, the sippy cup 

#### is an optional step toward using a “regular” cup. Many children transition from breast or bottle to a regular cup 

#### without a sippy cup in between!

## What about breastfed babies? 

#### With many parents pumping for convenience, little ones may drink breast milk from bottles as part of their regular 

#### routine. In this case, breastfeeding parents can follow the same steps for weaning as those who use formula. 

#### If you have used no bottles at all, you can still follow a weaning routine that uses many of the same steps. Introduce a 

#### cup filled with breast milk around 6 months of age, and slowly reduce the number of breastfeeding sessions from 

#### several per day to one and then, eventually, none. 

#### Keep in mind that your child can drink breast milk from a cup for as long as you want to provide it. Breastfeeding 

#### sessions will gradually become snuggle sessions offering your child physical comfort and love, just as you did when 

#### you were nursing. 

## Remember 

#### Offer your child a cup around 6 months, and steadily move away from bottle or breast feeding between 12 and 18 

#### months. The sooner you start, the easier the transition will be. 

#### Your child's resistance doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong. Be patient and trust that your little one will 

#### gradually start drinking like a big kid. 

#### If resistance turns into a full-blown power struggle, talk with your pediatrician. Also consult your pediatrician if your 

#### child has a chronic illness, physical difference or developmental delay that will affect their ability to move away from 

#### bottle feeding.
