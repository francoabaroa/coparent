# The Truth About Home Apnea Monitors for SIDs 

## When babies need them—and when 

## they don't 

## SIDS stands for sudden infant death syndrome. It is the sudden, 

## unexplained death of an infant under one year old. 

## SIDS is rare, but parents worry a lot about it. It is more common in 

## babies that were premature (/English/ages

## stages/baby/preemie/Pages/Health-Issues-of-Premature

## Babies.aspx). There's also more risk if you had another baby who 

## died of SIDS. 

## Home apnea monitors track the breathing and heart rate of sleeping babies. An alarm goes off if a baby's breathing 

## stops briefly (apnea) or if the heart rate is unusually slow. This monitor might sound like a good idea to concerned 

## parents. But most newborns do not need a monitor. Here's why: 

## Home apnea monitors give little or no protection from SIDS. 

## Research has not shown a clear link between apnea and SIDS. Even full-term newborns in the first few weeks of life 

## may have brief periods of apnea. But this is not linked to SIDS. 

## Monitors cause unnecessary worry. 

## Home apnea monitors cause many false alarms. The noise can make parents worry too much and lose sleep. 

## Parents may actually feel more fear and anxiety if they often use medical equipment to check on their healthy baby. 

## One study found that parents of monitored infants said they felt more depressed, compared to parents of infants that 

## weren't monitored. 

## There are better ways to protect babies against SIDS. 

## There has been a lot of research on SIDS. Since the start of the "Back to Sleep" campaign in 1994, there are half as many 

## SIDS deaths in the U.S. This campaign encourages two important steps to reduce the risk of SIDS (/English/ages

## stages/baby/sleep/Pages/Preventing-SIDS.aspx): 

## You should always put your baby to sleep on his or her back (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/Sleep

## Position-Why-Back-is-Best.aspx)—not on the stomach. 

## You should also use a firm crib mattress and keep pillows, blankets, and stuffed animals out of the crib. See How 

## to Keep Your Sleeping Baby Safe: AAP Policy Explained (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/a-parents-guide

## to-safe-sleep.aspx) for more information and tips. 

## These steps help prevent "re-breathing." Re-breathing can happen when a baby is sleeping face down or trapped in soft 

## bedding. As a result, the baby breathes more carbon dioxide instead of taking in oxygen-rich fresh air. This may be 

## related to raising a baby's risk of getting SIDS. 

## When is a home apnea monitor a good idea? 

## In rare cases, your doctor may recommend a home apnea monitor for your baby. The device may be needed if: 

## Your baby needs home oxygen (/English/ages-stages/baby/preemie/Pages/When-Baby-Needs-Oxygen-At

## Home.aspx).
