# Expressing Breastmilk On The Job 

## Readjusting to your previous work routine can be challenging enough without factoring in a 

## breastfeeding schedule. Fortunately, you have taken the time to prepare your baby, your 

## caregiver, your co-workers, and yourself for this new situation, so you are making the transition 

## in the best possible way. Starting back to work in the middle of the work week will make it easier 

## for everyone to adjust to the change, since this will provide you with a twoor three-day trial 

## period before you take on a full workweek. Plan ahead to take certain items to work with you each 

## day. Many women get everything together the night before. You will need your pump, a cooler for 

## transporting and perhaps storing breast milk, and a lunch or snacks to help keep your energy up. 

## You may also want to wear breast pads and pack a clean blouse or blazer in case of milk leakage 

## or spills. 

## On the first day back at work, check in with your supervisor; remind him about your agreement regarding your 

## breastfeeding schedule and make sure that the space allocated for expressing milk is still available. (If possible, visit 

## during your maternity leave to check on the space and to finalize any arrangements. This will ease your mind on that 

## busy first day back.) When you begin your first pumping sessions, try to relax and keep your mind off the people 

## waiting for you outside the room. Any stress could delay your letdown reflex or reduce your milk supply, delaying 

## your return even more. Trying to do paperwork or computer work at your desk or making phone calls while pumping 

## is generally not effective. Thinking about your baby—how comforted she will be as she drinks your breast milk and 

## how good for her your milk is—may help you relax and start your milk flow. Some women find that looking at a 

## photograph of their baby or even listening to a tape of her hunger cry works like a charm. 

## As you adjust to your new routine, you’ll learn ways to integrate your pumping schedule into your day. This will 

## become easier as your co-workers grow used to your brief absences one to three times per day and see that you can 

## still be productive in spite of them. You will learn how to slip discreetly out of a meeting that has run long and is 

## interfering with your pumping schedule—just as another co-worker might excuse himself to visit the restroom. You 

## may even find how easy it can be to recover from or laugh at any snafus—a milk stain on a blouse or an interrupted 

## pumping session—with the help of supportive and empathetic friends. 

## As you continue to express breast milk at work, monitor how much you are producing. Diminished milk supply is a 

## common problem for employed mothers and is most often the result of skipped pumping sessions or not pumping 

## long enough. Also, pumping may not express as much milk as a baby can get from a breastfeeding session if he is an 

## effective nurser. 

## To increase your supply, pump more frequently for at least ten minutes per session, even if your milk stops flowing 

## before then. When at home with your baby, offer him the breast at least every two or three hours. If he sleeps through 

## the night, consider waking him at your bedtime for an additional feeding. On weekends, breastfeed exclusively and 

## nurse whenever he shows an interest. 

## Once your milk production has increased again, maintain your supply by drinking an adequate amount of liquids, 

## getting enough rest, and relaxing as much as possible during pumping sessions. Remember, cutting a session short to 

## get back to work a few minutes earlier isn’t worth the cost in terms of your long-term breastfeeding relationship with 

## your baby. If these suggestions don’t help, contact your pediatrician or lactation specialist for additional advice.
