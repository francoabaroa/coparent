# Teeth Grinding in Children 

## Many children grind their teeth with a loud, grating sound while asleep. 

## Tooth grinding (or bruxism) is very common, particularly in toddlers and preschoolers. In most children, it 

## goes away by 6 years, but some continue to grind their teeth into adolescence and even adulthood. 

## Tooth grinding doesn’t mean that your child is having a nightmare (/English/ages

## stages/preschool/Pages/Nightmares-and-Night-Terrors.aspx) or reliving a frustrating event from the 

## daytime. Some causes of tooth grinding include pain (for instance, from an ear infection 

## (/English/health-issues/conditions/ear-nose-throat/Pages/Ear-Infection-Information.aspx) or 

## teething (/English/ages-stages/baby/teething-tooth-care/Pages/Teething-4-to-7-Months.aspx)) and improper alignment 

## of the teeth. 

## Although stress (/English/healthy-living/emotional-wellness/Pages/Helping-Children-Handle-Stress.aspx) and anxiety 

## (/English/health-issues/conditions/emotional-problems/Pages/Anxiety-Disorders.aspx) can also increase tooth 

## grinding, there is no connection between tooth grinding and problems of behavior or personality. Since it usually goes away 

## before the permanent teeth are in, in most cases it is unlikely to damage the teeth; however, if you have any concerns, check with 

## your child’s dentist and mention it at each regular dental check-ups.
