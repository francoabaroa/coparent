# Winning the Food Fights 

## Why do they want to cover everything with ketchup? Why do they insist they hate something 

## they’ve never even tried? If you’ve ever tried to get your child to eat without all the success you’d 

## hoped for, this new book may be just what you need. 

## As the mother of a 22-month-old boy who has discovered the power of stating his dining opinions 

## firmly, I couldn’t have received more timely support than that of my latest read, Food Fights: 

## Winning the Nutritional Challenges of Parenthood Armed with Insights, Humor, and a Bottle of 

## Ketchup (/English/bookstore/Pages/Food-Fights.aspx), by Laura A. Jana, M.D., FAAP, and Jennifer 

## Shu, M.D., FAAP, and published by the AAP. 

## Readers are likely to have the same sentiment regardless of their child’s age. After all, feeding one’s children is an 

## ongoing responsibility of parenthood that often becomes complicated by stage-specific needs — and that in addition 

## to a mountain of well-intentioned advice and government recommendations. 

## A quick search on “child nutrition” at Amazon.com Books finds more than 4,700 results. Pediatricians Jana and Shu 

## know that despite being exposed to all that information, we are still left with questions. Fortunately, they have 

## practical, reality-based answers. 

## A Tough Challenge 

## "It is impossible to ignore the fact that food-related battles rank right at the top of the daily list of parental challenges,” 

## write the co-authors. They let you know right away that they mean business, but they do it with the kind of 

## encouragement that you hope to gain from bonding with fellow parents. 

## Barely into the first chapter of Food Fights, one sure statement is enough to convince you: 

## “With some basic insights along with some palatable peacekeeping strategies, you can win the nutritional challenges 

## of parenthood and play a defining role in shaping your child’s lifelong eating habits.” 

## Thank goodness I resisted the urge to skip the practical advice for the newborn period in lieu of heading straight for 

## more curious matters — such as why “everything tastes better with ketchup.” With plenty of comic relief, Drs. Jana 

## and Shu draw on research, anecdotes, their experiences as pediatricians and mothers, and best practices. 

## “Reviewing the underlying principles of what you do and what you do for your kids can serve as a powerful way to 

## relate to them. Sometimes people can see it for themselves but not their kids,” says Dr. Jana. 

## Weighty Decisions 

## Before delving into the book’s main subject matter, Drs. Jana and Shu present two facts that can often be traced to poor 

## nutritional habits: 

## 1. Children with obese parents (/English/health-issues/conditions/obesity/Pages/Organic-Causes-of-Weight-Gain

## and-Obesity.aspx)are 80 percent more likely to become obese themselves 

## 2. 30 percent of American adults over the age of 20 are considered obese 

## Once the idea is introduced, it seems obvious enough that a child wants whatever his or her parents eat. But it’s a great 

## reminder for those of us who become parents believing we’ll become more health-conscious as our baby develops 

## more astute observation skills. 

## If that’s the case, it is one of the first ways parents are vulnerable to “slippery slopes,” or routines that “ease 

## themselves into existence while we’re too busy going about our parenting business to notice,” as the authors describe 

## it.

#### “While we had every intention of focusing our attention on the questions parents typically ask that are specific to 

#### their kids, we constantly found ourselves discussing eating habits in general,” write the authors. “After all, if we as 

#### parents can’t get our own eating habits and waistlines under control, how is it that we think we will be able to teach 

#### our children to do so?” 

## Strategizing and Peacekeeping 

#### “Parents often get themselves into a pattern and don’t know what’s coming or how to make the next transition. We’re 

#### giving people a heads-up before they turn what was a good thing into a bad habit (/English/family-life/family

#### dynamics/communication-discipline/Pages/Common-Childhood-Habits.aspx),” says Shu. She points out that once 

#### these habits are formed, we often admit that if someone had told us ahead of time, we might have done things 

#### differently. 

#### Consider some common examples, such as: 

#### Middle-of-the-night feedings (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/Sleeping-Through-the-Night.aspx) 

#### Battles over the bottle (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Practical-Bottle-Feeding-Tips.aspx) 

#### The cure-all status of a sippy-cup (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Discontinuing-the

#### Bottle.aspx) 

#### Food Fights introduces 10 “palatable peacekeeping strategies” to keep in mind. Meant as techniques to solve or 

#### prevent food-related struggles, the ideas surface throughout the book and illustrate the power of being proactive, 

#### rather than reactive. They also provide comfort for parents, who shouldn’t feel that they’re facing this battle alone. 

#### “A lot of principles are the same from age to age,” says Dr. Jana. “Once you extract all the fundamental principles, you 

#### can basically apply them to just about any food fight that arises.” 

## Patience Pays 

#### There is a message embedded throughout the book that parents need to hear over and over: Be patient with yourself, 

#### be patient with your children. One of the peacekeeping strategies is emphatic on this point: “If at first you don’t 

#### succeed ... try, try again.” Along with that, another point reminds you “the food pyramid wasn’t built in a day.” 

#### Another solution involves some patience, as well: the “no thank-you” bite, a tried-and-true source of compromise. 

#### Studies show that it can take between 10 and 15 tastes of one type of food before a child accepts it or likes it. Offering 

#### your child one taste before allowing him or her to refuse a dish adds up toward the desired result. 

#### “Don’t take ‘no’ as a rejection,” says Dr. Jana. “You’re making progress by just exposing your child to new foods and 

#### flavors.” 

## Away from Home 

#### Aside from its focus on the habits of daily eating in addition to the other body functions associated with it, a large 

### section of Food Fights is dedicated to the challenges of eating away from home. This can entail dining with family and 

#### friends, at restaurants (/English/ages-stages/preschool/nutrition-fitness/Pages/Eating-Out-Without

#### Reservations.aspx), and even on a plane (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Peanuts-on-a-Plane.aspx). 

#### “If you set the tone with consistency and expectations, children will be more likely to know that you expect them to 

#### act that way at somebody else’s house or a restaurant,” says Dr. Shu. “You always have to look at the next step.” 

### Indeed, Food Fights helps give you the confidence to look ahead to that next step. You don’t need to be daunted by the 

#### prospect of reading through every “childhood nutrition” book on the market. An outline of children’s tales 

### recommended in the chapter called “Read All About It!”, however, seems like a much better idea. 

#### Just remember: Your food fights are a battle your entire family can win one bite at a time. Having this timely battle 

#### plan in your hands is a great place to start.
