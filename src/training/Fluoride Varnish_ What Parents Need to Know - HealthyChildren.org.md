# Fluoride Varnish: What Parents Need to Know 

## Healthy gums and teeth are important to your child's overall health. 

## This is why your child's doctor will talk with you about good dental 

## habits (/English/healthy-living/oral-health/Pages/First-Steps-to-a

## Healthy-Smile.aspx) even before your child's first tooth appears. 

## Once your child has a tooth, your doctor may recommend that your 

## child receive fluoride varnish treatments in the pediatrician's office 

## to help prevent tooth decay (/English/healthy-living/oral

## health/pages/Preventing-Tooth-Decay-in-Children.aspx). This can 

## be done 2 to 4 times per year. The number of treatments depends 

## on how likely it is that your child may get a cavity. 

## Pediatricians are trained to apply fluoride varnish because many young children do not see or have access to a dentist 

## until they are older. If your child is seeing a dentist at a young age, as recommended by the American Academy of 

## Pediatrics, fluoride varnish may be applied in a dental office instead. 

## Read on for more information from the American Academy of Pediatrics about fluoride varnish. 

## What is Fluoride Varnish? 

## Fluoride varnish is a dental treatment that can help prevent tooth decay, slow it down, or stop it from getting worse. 

## Fluoride varnish is made with fluoride, a mineral that can strengthen tooth enamel (outer coating on teeth). 

## Keep in mind that fluoride varnish treatments cannot completely prevent cavities. Fluoride varnish treatments can 

## best help prevent decay when a child is also brushing using the right amount of toothpaste with fluoride, flossing 

## regularly, getting regular dental care, and eating a healthy diet. 

## Is Fluoride Varnish Safe? 

## Fluoride varnish is safe and used by dentists and doctors all over the world to help prevent tooth decay in children. 

## Only a small amount is used, and hardly any fluoride is swallowed. It is quickly applied and hardens. Then it is brushed 

## off after 4 to 12 hours. 

## Some brands of fluoride varnish make teeth look yellow. Other brands make teeth look dull. However, the color of 

## your child's teeth will return to normal after the fluoride varnish is brushed off. Most children like the taste. 

## How is Fluoride Varnish Put on the Teeth? 

## Fluoride varnish is painted on the top and sides of each tooth with a small brush. It is sticky but hardens once it comes 

## in contact with saliva. Your child may feel the hardened varnish with his tongue but will not be able to lick the varnish 

## off. 

## It does not hurt when the varnish is applied. However, young children may still cry before or during the procedure. 

## Fortunately, brushing on the varnish takes only a few minutes. Also, applying the varnish may be easier when a child is 

## crying because his mouth will be slightly open. 

## You may be asked to hold your child in your lap while you are placed knee-to-knee with the person applying the 

## varnish.
