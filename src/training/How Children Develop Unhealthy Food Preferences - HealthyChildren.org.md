# How Children Develop Unhealthy Food Preferences 

## By: Suanne Kowal-Connelly, MD, FAAP 

## Have you ever wondered why it's so difficult to get kids 

## to eat their vegetables? Not wanting to eat broccoli is 

## rooted in a great deal of more complicated issues than 

## just not liking green food. How we come to like certain 

## foods is associated with many factors and is referred to 

## as food preferences. 

## How Food Preferences Are 

## Developed: 

## In the first 2 years of life—when learning is constantly taking place—food preferences are also forming. Most are 

## learned, but some are innate. A child's food preferences directly affect eating behavior, which in turn is linked to 

## overall health, wellness, and the formation of obesity. 

## For years now, the food and beverage industry has used this knowledge to their advantage and encourages the 

## development of unhealthy food preferences in children of all ages through various marketing and advertising 

## techniques. 

## The Food and Beverage Industry's Role in the Formation of Food 

## Preferences: 

## How often have you seen a food advertisement for broccoli? Healthy foods are advertised less than 3% of the time in 

## comparison to their counterparts. This has a direct impact on children's food preferences—considering food and 

## beverage companies spend $2 billion dollars a year on food marketing campaigns directed at children. 

## The fast food industry spends nearly 5 million dollars a day marketing products high in sugar, fat and salt, while also 

## suggesting portion sizes grossly disproportionate to a child's energy needs. Increasingly, fast food companies are also 

## using toy tie-ins with major children's motion pictures to try to attract young people. Remarkably, studies 

## demonstrate that even very young children exposed to persuasive ads can develop food cravings for unhealthy foods 

## that they have never even tasted! 

## This has a direct consequence on the formation of potentially lifelong, unhealthy food preferences associated with the 

## development of obesity and all that comes with it. Although food preferences can be unlearned, this is often a 

## monumental task as we age. 

## Regulation—or lack thereof 

## The marketing of food to children on media is unregulated in the U.S. Instead, major food and beverage 

## manufacturers have voluntarily pledged to limit child-directed marketing of unhealthy foods as part of the Children's 

## Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative (http://www.bbb.org/council/the-national-partner-program/national

## advertising-review-services/childrens-food-and-beverage-advertising-initiative/). However, independent research 

## groups have highlighted several limitations of that program, and young children remain highly exposed to 

## advertisements for foods and beverages that may contribute to unhealthy food preferences. 

## The Problem with Baby and Toddler Snacks: 

## Reducing sodium and sugar intake early on can help set taste preferences and help children make healthy food 

## choices later in life. However, a report (http://www.uconnruddcenter.org/BabyFoodFACTS) from the UConn Rudd 

## Center for Food Policy & Obesity found only 4 out of 80 baby and toddler snacks met nutritious standards. In addition, 

## 50% of baby food snacks and 83% of toddler food snacks contained added sweeteners. 


##### Parents need to look carefully at nutrition labels (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Front-of-Package

##### Nutrition-Labels.aspx) when selecting commercial toddler foods and infant or toddler snacks, desserts, and juice 

##### drinks. Choose products lower in added sugar and sodium. Get tips here (/English/healthy

##### living/nutrition/Pages/How-to-Tame-Your-Childs-Sweet-Tooth.aspx) for taming your child's sweet tooth in a world of 

##### sugary treats. 

## The Problem Continues as Children Grow: 

##### Older children are bombarded with ad campaigns through every existing marketing vehicle. Walk through any 

##### supermarket and notice where the children's cereal is located. It invariably sits enticingly at a child's eye level. Point

##### of-sale placement of candies and sweets are another well-thought-out marketing tactic. 

### Food marketing and media use 

##### Children are also exposed to countless ads on TV, streaming services, through video games, social media, and most 

##### internet websites. This is one of many important reasons why the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 

##### recommends that screen time be avoided from birth to 18 months (except for video chatting with loved ones). Here's 

##### why (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/Why-to-Avoid-TV-Before-Age-2.aspx). Parents of children 18 to 24 months of 

##### age who want to introduce digital media should choose high-quality programming/apps and co-watch limited 

##### amounts together. For children 2 to 5, media limits are very appropriate and should be limited to 1 hour or less per day 

##### of high-quality programming. The AAP screen time guidelines also emphasize the role that media can play in 

##### disrupting healthy eating habits, such as when media is on during family mealtimes. Create a family media plan 

##### (/English/media/Pages/default.aspx) that includes screen-free zones, like the dinner table. 

#### And what about celebrity endorsements? A study (http://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.2015-3977) in the July 2016 Pediatrics 

##### examined the food industry's use of music celebrities to endorse sugary soft drinks and nutrient-poor foods through 

##### multi-million-dollar campaigns. Results also showed these celebrities are highly popular among teenage audiences— 

##### considering adolescents ages 12 to 18 report spending almost 2 hours listening to music each day! 

### Food marketing in schools 

##### Advertising, serving, and promoting unhealthy foods continues to occur in schools across the US. Many groups are 

##### actively pursuing innovative methods of enhancing food literacy for children and their families, which include 

##### improving food choices, as well as learning how to grow, cook and properly identify healthy foods. 

#### The AAP policy statement, Snacks, Sweetened Beverages, Added Sugars, and Schools 

#### (http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2014-3902) , explains the three categories of foods and 

##### beverages kids eat at school and where there is opportunity for parents, pediatricians, and students to raise awareness 

##### about the importance of healthy choices. It's understandable given the food preferences they have become 

##### accustomed to—and they are generally less expensive than healthier alternatives. 

##### A study (http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2015-1720) published in the August 2016 issue of 

#### Pediatrics suggests that marketing tactics, often blamed for popularizing nutritionally poor foods, can also lead more 

##### kids to select vegetables at lunchtime. Elementary school students were offered vegetables in their cafeteria from a 

##### large salad bar. In some schools, the salad bar was decorated with banners showing cartoon characters gaining 

##### "superhuman" powers by eating the salad bar veggies. Other schools showed the same scenario on a TV monitor set up 

##### nearby. Some schools used both the banners and the monitor to entice the kids. The control group had just the plain 

##### table of fresh veggies. In the group with the monitor and the banner, 3 times the vegetables were chosen. When either 

##### the banner or monitor was used, twice the healthy foods were taken as compared to the control group. Clearly, 

##### advertising can be manipulated to present messages of value capable of impacting the development of healthy food 

##### preferences and behaviors. 

## What Parents Can Do: 

##### Parents need to be well-informed about the potential negative health consequences of most current food marketing 

##### practices. This information can help them plan accordingly in reference to media exposure and the introduction of 

##### unhealthy foods in their child's diet. 

##### If you're not satisfied with the choices available in your child's school cafeteria, get involved (/English/family

##### life/Community/Pages/School-Lunches-You-Can-Make-a-Difference.aspx) in your school's parent-teacher 

##### organization and brainstorm some healthful alternatives, as parents and teachers all over the country are doing.
