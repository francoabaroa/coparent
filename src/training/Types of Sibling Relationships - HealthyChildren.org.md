# Types of Sibling Relationships 

## Almost 80% of children grow up with at least one brother or sister. Brothers and sisters teach 

## each other how to get along with others. Even if they do not always get along with each other, 

## siblings play very positive roles in each other's lives. 

## Read on to learn more about how siblings get along the way they do. 

## What is a sibling? 

## In today's world there are many types of families 

## (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/family-life/family-dynamics/types-of-families/pages/Different-Types-of

## Familes-A-Portrait-Gallery.aspx). Besides the traditional mother-and-father family, children are being raised by 

## grandparents, other relatives, foster parents (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/family-life/family

## dynamics/types-of-families/pages/Foster-Parenting.aspx), single parents 

## (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/family-life/family-dynamics/types-of-families/pages/Single-Parent

## Families.aspx), or same-sex parents (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/family-life/family-dynamics/types-of

## families/pages/Gay-and-Lesbian-Parents.aspx). As a result, brothers and sisters come in many forms. 

## Traditional siblings are brothers and sisters with the same mother and father. 

## Half siblings share either the same mother or the same father. 

## Stepsiblings (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/family-life/family-dynamics/types-of

## families/pages/Stepsiblings.aspx) are brothers and sisters who are not related biologically, but whose parents 

## are married to each other. No matter what type of siblings they are, their relationships with each other are 

## important. 

## Why siblings get along the way they do 

## Many things affect relationships between brothers and sisters. Some of these are: 

## Personality 

## Parents often wonder how children from the same parents growing up in the same home can be so different. In fact, siblings are 

## sometimes more different than alike. Even if siblings are alike in some ways, it is important for parents to recognize the unique 

## personality of each of their children. 

## Age 

## Children of different ages behave differently. For example, younger children may fight in more physical ways. As they get older, 

## their fighting may be more like arguments (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/family-life/family

## dynamics/Pages/Family-Arguments.aspx). 

## Gender 

## Gender affects relationships as well. Many parents find that children of the same sex compete with each other more than do 

## opposite-sex children. 

## Family size, spacing, and birth order 

## No two children view the family the same way. An only child's experience is different from that of a child in a larger family. 

## Children who are less than 2 years apart sometimes have more conflict than children who are spaced further apart.
