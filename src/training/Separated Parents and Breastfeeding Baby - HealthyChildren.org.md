# Separated Parents and Breastfeeding Baby 

## My wife and I separated during her pregnancy and she 

## has custody of the baby. I would like to set up a visitation 

## schedule with my baby. Is this possible with a 

## breastfeeding infant? 

## You are off to an excellent start as a parent by recognizing your child’s need to breastfeed as a top 

## priority at this time. Ideally, you will be able to work with the baby’s mother to create a visitation schedule that allows 

## for this need, rather than relying on a courtmandated arrangement that might be less favorable. 

## The best visitation schedule starts with the length and frequency of separations from the mother that your baby 

## already experiences, and gradually lengthens as time passes. If the mother doesn’t work outside the home and 

## breastfeeds on demand, you will need to begin with frequent, brief visits (perhaps visiting the child for an hour before 

## work, during lunch, or after work on appointed days, preferably in the mother’s home). 

## If he is accustomed to longer separations with a caregiver, you can take the caregiver’s place for the same length of 

## time. As you increase the number and length of your visits with your child, discuss with his mother the possibility of 

## using a bottle to feed him breast milk she has expressed with a pump or by hand—and keep in mind that you will be 

## able to feed him other foods after he is six months old. 

## Once you have reached this stage and feedings are spaced apart more, it becomes easier for you to go out with your 

## child for a brief time. Eventually he will be able to happily stay overnight and on weekends with you.
