# Possible Problems: Inverted, Flat, or Pierced Nipples 

## Inverted or Flat Nipples 

## One breast characteristic you should certainly point out to your obstetrician and pediatrician is 

## inverted or flat nipples. Inverted nipples retract inward toward the breast instead of protruding 

## out when the areola is gently squeezed. Flat nipples neither retract nor protrude but remain 

## more or less flat. When not compressed, some inverted nipples appear normal. Others contain a 

## small dimple or may have a clear indentation at all times. You can test your own nipples by gently 

## compressing the areola about one to two inches behind the nipple. If your nipples draw inward or 

## remain flat, tell your obstetrician and pediatrician. 

## Inverted nipples, and to a lesser extent flat nipples, can create a problem during breastfeeding by making it more 

## difficult for the baby to properly latch on to the breast. In some cases, inverted nipples may actually impede the flow of 

## milk. They are also more prone to injury of the nipple surface. Fortunately, a woman with inverted or flat nipples can 

## still breastfeed if her nipples can protrude outward with stimulation. In addition, inverted and flat nipples sometimes 

## become sufficiently everted, or normally protruding, on their own during pregnancy, so that by the time the baby is 

## born, breastfeeding can proceed without problems. Even if the nipples don’t evert on their own, this characteristic 

## should not prevent most women from successfully breastfeeding their children. 

## Some methods used in the past to correct inverted nipples during pregnancy may actually reduce breastfeeding 

## success and are no longer routinely recommended. These include using breast shells—plastic cups with a hole in the 

## center that are pressed against the breasts, leaving the nipples exposed. (Breast shells may be helpful after childbirth, 

## although their benefit has not been proven in studies.) Manual exercises to encourage the nipples to protrude, called 

## nipple rolling, have no effect. Experts now agree that it is best to wait until after childbirth to address inverted nipples 

## —but your medical support team certainly should be informed about your situation to better guide you. 

## Pierced Nipples 

## In most cases, pierced nipples do not interfere with breastfeeding, though any rings or studs should be removed prior 

## to a breastfeeding session to prevent choking. If your piercing became infected at the time of the piercing or later, 

## inform your doctor. Such infection, as well as any scarring that may have occurred, can make nursing more difficult. 

## While breastfeeding, some of your milk may leak through the pierced hole. This is usually not a problem, but if you 

## have any questions, be sure to ask your pediatrician or a lactation specialist to check that your baby is nursing well.
