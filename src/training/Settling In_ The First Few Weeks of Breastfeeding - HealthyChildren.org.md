# Settling In: The First Few Weeks of Breastfeeding 

## The first weeks of breastfeeding are a fascinating time of transition for you as well as your baby. 

## During this time you will learn what it feels like to breastfeed, how to recognize your baby’s 

## hunger signals, and how to know when your let-down or milk ejection reflex has occurred. You 

## will learn whether your baby is a frequent snacker or prefers less frequent but longer meals, 

## whether nursing tends to put her to sleep or to stimulate her, and whether she enjoys pausing 

## occasionally to exchange looks with you or focuses entirely upon nursing until she’s had her fill. 

## She will not always breastfeed in the same way, of course—just as you will not always be in the 

## same mood each time you nurse. But you will begin to recognize and respond to breastfeeding 

## cues. As you do so, the two of you will gradually grow more comfortable together, respond to each 

## other’s signals more effectively, and develop a unique breastfeeding rhythm. 

## Ideally, by the time you arrive home your baby will already have learned to latch on to the breast properly. Your 

## newborn may even prefer one breast at this point, tending to nurse longer on one than on the other. It is a good idea to 

## let her nurse as long as she wants. Keep in mind that once your mature milk comes in, its content changes during the 

## course of a single breastfeeding from the somewhat watery foremilk to the creamier, fat-rich hindmilk, which, like any 

## good dessert, leaves your baby feeling content and sleepy. By allowing your baby to nurse until she’s satisfied (once 

## she’s latched on properly), you can ensure that she will receive all the benefits of breast milk. 

## Even if she clearly prefers one breast over the other, however, it’s important to alternate the breast you offer first with 

## each breastfeeding session. This ensures that a full milk supply is stimulated for both breasts and that as much milk 

## as possible has been removed from each. At first, to remember which breast to start with, consider moving a safety pin 

## from one side of your nursing bra to the other after each feeding. Later on you will know which breast feels fuller and 

## start the next feeding there.
