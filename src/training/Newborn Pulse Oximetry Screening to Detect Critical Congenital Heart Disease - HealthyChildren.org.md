# Newborn Pulse Oximetry Screening to Detect Critical 

# Congenital Heart Disease 

## Most babies are born with healthy hearts and have enough oxygen 

## in their blood. However, about 1 baby in every 100 is born with a 

## congenital heart defect (CHD (/English/health

## issues/conditions/heart/Pages/Challenges-Faced-by-Parents-of

## Children-with-Congenital-Heart-Disease.aspx)) and 25% of those 

## babies with CHD will have a critical congenital heart defect (CCHD). 

## Babies with critical CHDs have low oxygen levels and usually 

## require surgery or other procedures in the first year of life. 

## Sometimes intervention must be done urgently, within the first 

## days or weeks of a baby's life. Some examples of critical CHDs 

## include coarctation of the aorta, transposition of the great arteries, 

## hypoplastic left heart syndrome, and tetralogy of Fallot. 

## What is pulse oximetry? 

## Pulse oximetry ( also called pulse ox) is a simple and painless test 

## that measures the level oxygen is in the blood. 

## There are types of CCHD that cause lower than usual blood 

## oxygen levels and those can be picked up by pulse 

## oximetry―even before a baby becomes sick. Early detection and 

## appropriate management can then be provided and may improve a 

## baby's outcome. 

## The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends pulse 

## oximetry be performed at all newborn screenings to detect 

## CCHD. As of 2018, policies for screening newborns have been 

## implemented in all states in the U.S. 

## Fetal ultrasounds of the heart do not detect all types of heart defects. 

## While many problems in the fetal heart are now found early by fetal ultrasounds―and families are getting referred 

## earlier to pediatric cardiologists (/English/family-life/health-management/pediatric-specialists/Pages/What-is-a

## Pediatric-Cardiologist.aspx) for further care, there are still cases of CHD that can be missed. 

## Many newborns develop signs and symptoms of CCHD such as turning very blue or breathing fast right after birth. 

## Those babies are diagnosed and treated before being discharged from the hospital. However, there are babies with 

## certain types of CCHD who may look and act healthy for several days before becoming suddenly seriously ill at home. 


## How is this screening is done? 

#### A small soft sensor is wrapped around the baby's right hand and one foot. The sensor is 

#### hooked up to a monitor for about 5 minutes and measures the oxygen level in the blood and 

#### the heart rate. It is fast, easy, and does not hurt. Pulse oximetry screening is done after 24 

#### hours after birth to allow the baby's heart and lungs to fully adjust to life outside his or her 

#### mother. After the screening is completed, the doctor or nurse will go over the reading with 

#### the baby's parents. 

## What happens a baby fails the pulse oximetry screening? 

#### If the screening test suggests a problem, additional testing to evaluate for CHD or for other potential causes of low 

#### oxygen will be necessary before the baby will be discharged from the hospital. 

#### Testing may include a chest radiography and bloodwork. A thorough ultrasound of the baby's heart called an 

#### echocardiogram will be performed and read by a pediatric cardiologist. The echo will evaluate all the structures and 

#### function of the baby's heart in detail. If the baby's echo shows any problems, the baby's medical team will discuss next 

### steps with the parents in detail. See Common Types of Cardiac Testing (/English/health

### issues/conditions/heart/Pages/Common-Types-of-Cardiac-Testing.aspx) for more information. 

#### Note: As with any screening test, sometimes there can be times when the pulse oximetry screening test is not correct. 

#### Sometimes there can be false positives, meaning that while the pulse ox screen suggests a problem, the echo will be 

#### reassuring that the heart is normal. Just because a baby fails the pulse oximetry screening test does not mean that 

#### the baby has a heart defect. There are other reasons that a baby may have lower oxygen levels, such as infection or 

#### lung problems. These are also very helpful to be picked up early. As well, some healthy babies can have a low pulse 

#### oximetry reading while their heart and lungs are adjusting after birth. 

## If a baby passes the pulse oximetry screening, does it mean he or she 

## has no heart defects? 

#### Unfortunately, no. Pulse oximetry testing picks up only some types of CHD. Heart defects which are not causing a low 

#### blood oxygen level at the time of the screen are not picked up by the test. 

#### Even if a baby passes the pulse oximetry screening, parents should watch: 

#### How well their baby is feeding 

#### Any difficulty in breathing 

#### Increased irritability 

#### Excessive sleepiness 

#### Bluish color to the lips or skin 

#### Grunting 

#### Fast breathing 

#### Poor weight gain 

#### Parents are advised to contact their baby's doctor right away if they notice any of these signs.
