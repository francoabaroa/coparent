# Building Balanced Snacks to Feed to Toddlers

## Toddlers need important nutrients to build their brains 

## and bodies. Children this age use a lot of energy to grow 

## and play, but they have small stomachs. They may not 

## be able to eat enough at mealtime to make it between 

## lunch and dinner. 

## Every toddler is different. Many toddlers need an 

## afternoon snack. Some toddlers also need a morning 

## snack. 

## Here are some ideas to help you build snacks for your hungry toddler that offer a healthy balance of the nutrients 

## they need. 

## How to put balanced snacks together 

## Children sometimes come to think of a "snack" as a time to eat highly processed foods (/English/healthy

## living/nutrition/Pages/Food-Additives.aspx). You can help avoid this trap by serving a variety of healthy, freshly 

## prepared foods to your kids—even at snack time. 

## Keep in mind that not every snack needs to be a mini-meal; a balanced diet can be achieved over the course of the 

## entire day. When you serve snacks with fruits and veggies, whole grains, beans and proteins, though, you know your 

## toddler is on the right nutritional track. 

## Some balanced snacks you can put together using key food categories: 

## Fruits 

## Apples, peaches, plums, pears (all thinly sliced) 

## Grapes, grape tomatoes, berries (all smashed or cut lengthwise) 

## Oranges, grapefruit sections (cut into pieces) 

## To make a balanced snack for your toddler, you can 

## include: 

## a protein food (includes dairy foods) 

## a fruit and/or vegetable and 

## a grain or starchy vegetable 


##### Bananas (sliced lengthwise) 

##### Frozen fruit (defrosted and cut into pieces) 

##### Avocado (sliced) 

##### Dried apricots, peaches, pears, dates, prunes, raisins (pitted and cut into small pieces) 

##### Rinsed canned fruits 

### Example combinations 

##### Plain yogurt + defrosted frozen fruit (diced) + a piece of toast 

##### Paper thin sliced apples + thin spread of seed butter + cooked frozen pea 

## Vegetables 

##### Carrots, green beans, cauliflower, broccoli (steamed until soft) 

##### Yams or sweet potatoes (cooked and diced) 

##### Peas (cooked and smushed) 

##### Steamed spinach or greens (pureed) 

##### Rinsed canned vegetables 

### Example combinations 

##### Rinsed canned corn + diced cooked sweet potato + smashed black beans 

##### Steamed cauliflower + cooked rice + cooked tofu cubes 

## Dairy products 

##### Plain yogurt 

##### Cow's milk or non-dairy (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/milk-allergy-foods-and-ingredients-to

##### avoid.aspx) milk 

##### Cottage cheese 

##### Cheese (shredded or diced) 

### Example combinations 

##### Quesadilla made with cheese + quartered grape tomatoes 

##### Cottage cheese + rinsed canned peaches + English muffin 

## Grains 

##### Tortillas, pita bread, whole wheat bread 

##### Rice, corn, quinoa, grits (cooked) 

##### Hot cereals 

##### No or low-sugar whole grain cold breakfast cereals soaked in milk 

### Example combinations

##### Oatmeal + peanut butter and shredded apple stirred into it 

##### O's cereal soaked in non-dairy milk + scrambled eggs + smashed blueberries 

## Proteins 

##### Salmon and sardines 

##### Chunk light (skipjack) tuna can be served once per month. Tuna fish can be higher in mercury, which is not good 

#### for toddlers. (See "Healthy Fish Choices for Kids (/English/safety-prevention/all-around/Pages/Protecting-Your

#### Children-From-Contaminated-Fish.aspx) .") 

##### Peanut butter, nut and seed butters (spread thinly) 

##### Edamame, chickpeas, beans (cooked and mashed) 

##### Lentils 

##### Hummus 

##### Cooked tofu cubes 

##### Eggs (scrambled or hard boiled and cut) 

##### Chicken, turkey, pork, beef, lamb (cooked and diced) 

##### Ground nuts and seeds (mixed into foods) 

### Example combinations 

##### Cooked quinoa + diced chicken + steamed broccoli 

##### Cooked rice + lentil curry with greens 

## Toddler serving sizes 

##### Serve toddlers small portions to start, such as 3 quartered strawberries and ⅛ of a quesadilla. 

##### If your child finishes this, they will decide if they are still hungry and ask for more. If they don't finish this, they are 

##### full. Let them stop eating. 

##### Because you are serving snacks with fruits and veggies, whole grains, beans and proteins, it's okay to let them fill up at 

##### snack time. 

## Foods to avoid with toddlers 

### Choking hazards 

##### Big chunks of food, and hard, round, and slippery foods are a choking hazard for children under age 4. Cook or cut up 

##### these foods to minimize choking risk. Avoid whole nuts, spoons of peanut butter, and popcorn until age 4. 

### Sugary, salty & overly processed foods 

##### Toddlers don't need added sodium or sugar (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/How-to-Reduce-Added-Sugar

##### in-Your-Childs-Diet.aspx). For health reasons, avoid added sodium and sugar until they are 2 years old. 

##### Foods like salty crackers, chips, cookies, pastries and cakes can be fun sometimes, but your child will eat these when 

##### they are older. Serve these foods less often. 

## Best beverages for toddlers 

##### Serve snacks with water or milk (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Recommended-Drinks-for-Young

##### Children-Ages-0-5.aspx). Delay serving juice until age 2 to help protect your child's teeth and avoid developing a 

##### preference for sweet drinks. (See "Recommended Drinks for Children Age 5 & Younger (/English/healthy

##### living/nutrition/Pages/Recommended-Drinks-for-Young-Children-Ages-0-5.aspx).")
