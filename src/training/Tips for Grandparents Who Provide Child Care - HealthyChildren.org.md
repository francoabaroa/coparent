# Tips for Grandparents Who Provide Child Care 

## As a grandparent, you may become the person providing part-time care for your grandchild at 

## times, perhaps on a scheduled day or two during the week or for a few hours here and there. 

## The recommendations about the best environment for the child, safety issues, special needs, and 

## the size of the group (if you care for more than one child) should be considered. 

## You are not just "another babysitter" 

## As a grandparent, your role is unique and important. You are not just "another babysitter." You 

## have a fundamental connection, providing the continuity between generations that your grandchild will come to 

## understand and respect. 

## Take advantage of this irreplaceable role. Your involvement with your grandchild, introducing him to your 

## own world, is especially valuable. Treasure it. 

## Make the most of those special days when you are the babysitter, and offer to do it regularly if you are able. 

## Share stories with your grandchild and read to him regularly (/english/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Developmental

## Milestones-of-Early-Literacy.aspx). 

## Assisting with drop off and pick up 

## At times, you may not be the actual caregiver for your grandchild, but rather you'll take him to and from a child care 

## center or babysitter (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/babysitting-reminders.aspx). 

## When driving with your grandchild, be sure he is properly buckled in the appropriate car seat at all times. 

## Provide another set of eyes to evaluate the quality of the center (/English/family-life/work-play/Pages/Your

## Child-Care-Checklist.aspx) or sitter. This will help your grandchild's parents feel secure in their own choice of a 

## child care setting. 

## Note: If you've accepted the responsibility of picking up or dropping off your grandchild at regular times, introduce 

## yourself to the responsible person at that site and provide them with your telephone number as a contact person. 

## Realizing times have changed 

## As you know, times have changed, although caring love is still the universal and timeless ingredient in helping 

## children to thrive. 

## Educate yourself on the new medical discoveries since you raised your own children by asking your grandchild's 

## parents to share information. The medical profession has learned a lot about having infants sleep safely on their backs 

## (/English/family-life/work-play/Pages/A-Child-Care-Provider%27s-Guide-to-Safe-Sleep.aspx) and on safer over-the

## counter medications (/english/safety-prevention/at-home/medication-safety/Pages/Choosing-Over-the-Counter

## Medicines-for-Your-Child.aspx) for illnesses, as well as many other things. It keeps us young to learn new things. 

## Medication safety 

## At your home, make sure that you secure any of your personal medications by storing them up and away from sight or 

## reach so that your grandchild can't get hold of them. See Childproofing Tips for Grandparents (/english/safety

## prevention/at-home/Pages/A-Message-for-Grandparents-Keeping-Your-Grandchild-Safe-in-Your-Home.aspx) for 

## more information.
