# Potty Talk: How Parents Can Discourage the Behavior 

## My three-year-old daughter’s interest in toilet training 

## has come with an unfortunate side effect: potty talk. 

## While I am happy to see her learning to use her potty 

## with relative ease, I am very tired of hearing the words 

## poopy-head, butt, and pee-pee shouted out in public 

## places, followed by gales of laughter. How can I stop this kind of talk 

## without dampening my child’s interest in her potty? 

## Bathroom humor, or potty talk, commonly accompanies toilet training and preschool development in general. Three

## and four-year-olds become interested in these words as they hear them increasingly from you during toilet training 

## (/english/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/default.aspx)or from their friends during play. Not only do these 

## new terms seem to hold the key to the puzzle of how their bodies work and why boys and girls differ—two issues that 

## fascinate them at this age—but they offer the added punch of terrific shock value. Saying “poopy-head” is bound to get 

## a strong reaction from you and plenty of laughter from your daughter’s friends. What preschooler could resist such a 

## word? 

## How to Discourage Potty Talk 

## You can discourage this behavior (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/communication-discipline/Pages/Normal

## Child-Behavior.aspx) by taking care not to overreact to it. If your child gets no shocked response, using the words is 

## not as fun. Calmly acknowledge her motive for using such terms (“That word sounds funny to you, huh?”), then 

## redirect her attention (“I know a good joke. Listen to this.. .”). 

## It is not too soon, also, to start teaching your child that certain behavior is appropriate in some situations but not in 

## others (“Talk about bathroom stuff with Mom and Dad, not with your brother’s friends.”). As long as you don’t expect 

## perfect results right away and don’t focus too intensely on this issue, it will pass.
