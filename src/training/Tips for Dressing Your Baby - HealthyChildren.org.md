# Tips for Dressing Your Baby 

## Step-by-Step 

## When dressing your baby: While supporting your baby on 

## your lap, stretch the garment neckline and pull it over your 

## baby's head. Use your fingers to keep it from catching on his 

## or her face or ears. Don't try to push your baby's arm through 

## the sleeve. Instead, put your hand into the sleeve from the 

## outside, grasp your baby's hand, and pull it through. 

## When undressing your baby: Take off the sleeves one at a 

## time while you support your baby's back and head. Then 

## stretch the neckline, lifting it free of your baby's chin and face 

## as you gently slip it off. 

## Clothing Tips 

## In colder weather (under 75 degrees Fahrenheit [23.88 degrees Celsius]): Your baby will need several layers of 

## clothing to keep warm. It's generally best to dress your baby in an undershirt and diapers, covered by pajamas or 

## a dressing gown, and then wrap him or her in a receiving blanket. For an extra layer, a wearable blanket sleeper 

## or sleep sack is a safe alternative. 

## In hot weather (over 75 degrees Fahrenheit [23.88 degrees Celsius]): You can reduce your baby's clothing to a 

## single layer. A good rule of thumb is to dress the baby in one more layer of clothing than you are wearing to be 

## comfortable in the same environment. See Baby Sunburn Prevention (/English/ages-stages/baby/bathing-skin

## care/Pages/Baby-Sunburn-Prevention.aspx) for more information. 

## If your baby is premature : He or she may need still another layer of clothing until his or her weight reaches 

## that of a full-term baby and his or her body is better able to adjust to changes in temperature. 

## If you've never taken care of a newborn baby before : The first few times you change a baby's clothes can be 

## quite frustrating. Not only is it a struggle to get that tiny little arm through the sleeve, but your baby may shriek 

## in protest through the whole process. Babies do not like the rush of air against their skin, nor do they enjoy being 

## pushed and pulled through garments. It may make things easier for both of you if you hold your baby on your lap 

## while changing the upper half of the body, then lay him or her on a bed or changing table while doing the lower 

## half. 

## When you're dressing her in one-piece pajamas : Pull them over your baby's legs before putting on the sleeves. 

## Pull T-shirts over her head first, then put one arm at a time through the sleeves. Use this opportunity to ask 

## "Where's the baby's hand?" As your baby gets older this will turn into a game, with him or her pushing his or her 

## arm through just to hear you say, "There's the baby's hand!" 

## Certain clothing features can make dressing much easier. Look for garments 

## that: 

## Snap or zip all the way down the front, instead of the back 

## Snap or zip down both legs to make diaper changes easier 

## Have loose-fitting sleeves so your hand fits underneath to push the baby's arm through 

## Have no ribbons or strings to knot up, unravel, or wrap around the neck (which could cause choking)

#### Are made of stretchy fabric (avoid tight bindings around arms, legs, or neck) 

## Swaddling 

#### During the first few weeks, your baby will spend most of his or her time wrapped in a receiving blanket. Not only does 

#### this keep your baby warm, but the slight pressure around the body seems to give most newborns a sense of security. 

### How to swaddle correctly: 

#### 1. To swaddle (/English/ages-stages/baby/diapers-clothing/Pages/swaddling-is-it-safe.aspx), spread the blanket out 

#### flat, with one corner folded down. 

#### 2. Lay your baby face-up on the blanket, with his or her head above the folded corner. 

#### 3. Straighten your baby's left arm, and wrap the left corner of the blanket over your baby's body and tuck it between 

#### his or her right arm and the right side of his or her body. 

#### 4. Then tuck the right arm down, and fold the right corner of the blanket over your baby's body and under his or her 

#### left side. 

#### 5. Fold or twist the bottom of the blanket loosely and tuck it under one side of your baby. 

#### 6. Make sure your baby's hips can move and that the blanket is not too tight. You want to be able to get at least two 

#### or three fingers between the baby's chest and the swaddle.
