# Childproofing Your Home for Poisons 

## Children are naturally curious and love to explore. 

## Young children especially like to explore by putting 

## things in their mouths. 

## Before or as soon as your child begins crawling or 

## walking, take extra steps to make sure harmful items 

## are out of reach, out of sight, and ideally stored in a 

## cabinet with lock or safety latch. Check each room of 

## your home for these potential hazards: 

## Cleaning products 

## All-purpose cleaners 

## Bleach (/English/health-issues/conditions/prevention/Pages/Cleaners-Sanitizers-Disinfectants.aspx) 

## Dishwashing detergent (liquid, powdered, or single-use packets or tablets) 

## Drain openers and toilet bowl cleaners 

## Furniture polish 

## Laundry detergent (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/Laundry-Room-and-Detergent-Safety.aspx) 

## (liquid, powdered, or single-use packets or tablets) 

## Detergent in single-use laundry packets (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/Laundry-Room-and

## Detergent-Safety.aspx) is very concentrated and can be toxic. 

## Even a small amount of the detergent can cause serious breathing or stomach problems or eye irritation. 

## Never let your children handle or play with the packets. The packets dissolve quickly when in contact with 

## water, wet hands, or saliva. Biting a packet can cause it to burst, shooting detergent into the child's mouth and 

## throat or eyes. 

## Remember to seal the container and store it in a locked cabinet after each use. Make sure the container is out 

## of sight and reach of children. 

## Adults should follow the instructions on the product label. 

## Personal and hygiene products 

## Nail polish removers 

## Cosmetics (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/Face-Paints-Makeup-Toxic-Ingredients.aspx) 

## Mouthwash 

## Perfume and aftershave 

## Items that may be in your basement or garage 

## Antifreeze and windshield wiper fluid 


#### Gasoline (/English/ages-stages/teen/substance-abuse/Pages/Gasoline-Sniffing.aspx), kerosene, and lamp oil

#### devices that contain small button-cell batteries out of reach and sight of children. Button batteries can cause 

#### severe injury or death if ingested.

### Houseplants 

#### Certain houseplants may be harmful if children get ahold of them. Call Poison Help at 1-800-222-1222 for a list or 

#### description of plants to avoid. You may want to do without houseplants for a while or, at the very least, keep all 

#### houseplants out of reach.

#### caregivers are home but not paying attention.

## What to do in case of poisoning 

#### If you find your child with an open or empty container of a dangerous nonfood item, your child may have been 

#### poisoned. 

#### 1. Stay calm and act quickly. 

#### 2. Get the item away from your child. If there is still some in your child's mouth, make your child spit it out or 

#### remove it with your fingers. Keep this material along with anything else that might help determine what your 

#### child swallowed. 

#### 3. Do not make your child vomit because it may cause more damage. 

#### If your child is unconscious, not breathing, or having convulsions or seizures, call 911 or your local emergency 

#### number right away. 

#### If your child does not have these symptoms, call Poison Help at 1-800-222-1222. You may be asked for the following 

#### information: 

#### Your name and phone number 

#### Your child's name, age, and weight 

#### Any medical conditions your child has 

#### Any medicine your child is taking 

#### The name of the item your child swallowed 

#### The time your child swallowed the item (or when you found your child), and the amount you think was 

#### swallowed 

#### If the poison is very dangerous, or if your child is very young, you may be told to take your child to the nearest hospital. 

#### If your child is not in danger, the Poison Help staff will tell you what to do to help your child at home.
