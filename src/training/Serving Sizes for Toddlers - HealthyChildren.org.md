# Serving Sizes for Toddlers 

## A toddler's daily energy requirements are not very large. After 

## tripling their birth weight by their first babies, a child's growth 

## (/English/health-issues/conditions/Glands-Growth

## Disorders/Pages/Growth-Charts-By-the-Numbers.aspx) slows 

## down. So, the amount they eat does not need to be huge. 

## A general guide for feeding your 

## toddler 

## Each day, a child between ages 1 and 3 years needs about 40 

## calories for every inch of height. This means that a toddler 

## who measures 32 inches in height, for example, should be taking in an average of about 1,300 calories a day. 

## However, the amount varies with each child's build and activity level. 

## The child's serving size should be approximately one-quarter of an adult's. 

## Example of an average toddler-sized meal 

## One ounce of meat, or 2 to 3 tablespoons of beans 

## One to 2 tablespoons of vegetables 

## One to 2 tablespoons of fruit 

## One-quarter slice of bread 

## Your toddler will get enough calories along with all the protein (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Beyond

## Chicken-Nuggets.aspx), vitamins, and minerals they need from an average daily intake similar to the chart below.
