# Corrected Age For Preemies 

## If your baby was born early, you have 2 important days to mark on 

## the calendar: the day your baby was born and your estimated due 

## date. 

## When you measure your baby's development—that is, when you 

## look at what is "normal" for your baby's age—consider both of those 

## dates. By looking at the difference between them, you can adjust 

## your baby's calendar age to account for prematurity and calculate 

## his or her corrected age. 

## During the first 2 years, using your baby's corrected age will 

## give you a better idea when he or she should reach common 

## developmental goals. 

## Calculating corrected age isn't difficult. 

## Here's how: 

## Begin with your baby's actual age in weeks (number of weeks since the date of birth) and then subtract the number of 

## weeks your baby was preterm. This is your baby's corrected age. (A pregnancy is now considered "full term" at 39 

## weeks (/English/ages-stages/prenatal/delivery-beyond/Pages/Let-Baby-Set-the-Delivery-Date-Wait-until-39-Weeks

## if-You-Can.aspx).) 

## To determine the number of weeks' preterm your baby was at birth, subtract gestational age at birth from 40. 

## Here's an example... 

## If your baby was born at 32 weeks' gestation, she was 8 weeks (2 months) preterm. If she is now 4 months old (16 weeks 

## since birth), her corrected age is 2 months. In this case, even if your baby is 4 months old, you should expect her to 

## have the developmental skills of a 2-month-old term baby. It would be unrealistic to expect your baby to be ready to 

## roll from her stomach to her back—a skill that often develops in term babies around the age of 4 months. 

## Your baby may just be beginning to hold her head up and smile, which is developmentally normal for a term baby of 2 

## months and, therefore, for a preterm baby whose corrected age is 2 months. 

## Parents are often frustrated by well-meaning family and friends who express concerns about their baby's 

## development. People may think your baby is delayed for a 4-month-old, for example, when, in fact, she is on target for a 

## baby with a corrected age of 2 months.
