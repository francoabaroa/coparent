# Why Babies Spit Up 

## By: Alejandro Velez, MD, FAAP & Christine Waasdorp Hurtado, 

## MD, FAAP 

## All babies spit up. Some babies spit up more than 

## others, or at certain times. 

## Typically, babies spit up after they gulp down some air 

## with breastmilk or formula. A baby's stomach is small 

## and can't hold a lot, after all. Milk and air can fill it up 

## quickly. 

## With a full stomach, any change in position such as 

## bouncing or sitting up can force the flap between the 

## esophagus (food pipe) and stomach to open. And when that flap (the esophageal sphincter) opens, that's when some of 

## what your baby just ate can make a return appearance. 

## So, what can you do―if anything―to reduce the amount of your baby's spit up? How do you know if your baby's 

## symptoms are part of a larger problem? Read on to learn more. 

## Common concerns parents have about spit up 

## My baby spits up a little after most feedings. 

## Possible cause: Gastroesophageal reflux (/English/health-issues/conditions/abdominal/Pages/GERD

## Reflux.aspx) (normal if mild) 

## Action to take: None. The spitting up will grow less frequent and stop as your baby's muscles mature—especially 

## that flap we talked about earlier. It often just takes time. 

## My baby gulps their feedings and seems to have a lot of gas. 

## Possible cause: Aerophagia (swallowing more air than usual) 

## Action to take: Make sure your baby is positioned properly during feeds. Also be sure to burp the baby during 

## and after feeds. Consider trying a different bottle to decrease your baby's ability to suck in air. 

## My baby spits up when you bounce them or play with them after meals. 

## Possible cause: Overstimulation 

## Action to take: Keep mealtimes calm. Limit active play for about 20 to 30 minutes afterward. 

## My baby's spitting up has changed to vomiting with muscle contractions that 

## occur after every feeding. The vomit shoots out with force. 

## Possible cause: Pyloric stenosis (/English/health-issues/conditions/abdominal/Pages/Hypertrophic-Pyloric

## Stenosis-HPS-Babies-Forceful-Vomiting.aspx) or another health problem that requires diagnosis and treatment. 

## Action to take: Call you pediatrician right away so they can examine your baby. 


### I found blood in my baby's spit-up or vomit. 

##### Possible cause: Swelling of the esophagus or stomach (esophagitis or gastritis), or another health problem that 

##### requires diagnosis and treatment. 

##### Action to take: Call you pediatrician right away so they can examine your baby. 

## Remedies for spitty babies 

##### Regardless of whether or not your baby's spit up warrants watchful waiting or medical intervention, there are some 

##### simple feeding suggestions that can help you deal with the situation at hand. 

### 5 tips to reduce your baby's spit up 

##### Avoid overfeeding. Like a gas tank, fill baby's stomach it too full (or too fast) and it's going to spurt right back out 

##### at you. To help reduce the likelihood of overfeeding, feed your baby smaller amounts more frequently. 

##### Burp your baby more frequently. Extra gas in your baby's stomach has a way of stirring up trouble. As gas 

##### bubbles escape, they have an annoying tendency to bring the rest of the stomach's contents up with them. To 

##### minimize the chances of this happening, burp not only after, but also during meals. 

##### Limit active play after meals and hold your baby upright. Pressing on a baby's belly right after eating can up 

##### the odds that anything in their stomach will be forced into action. While tummy time (/English/ages

##### stages/baby/sleep/Pages/back-to-sleep-tummy-to-play.aspx) is important for babies, postponing it for a while 

##### after meals can serve as an easy and effective avoidance technique. 

##### Consider the formula. If your baby is formula feeding (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding

##### nutrition/Pages/Amount-and-Schedule-of-Formula-Feedings.aspx), there's a possibility that their formula could 

##### be contributing to their spitting up. While some babies simply seem to fare better with one formula over another 

##### without having a true allergy or intolerance (/English/health-issues/conditions/abdominal/Pages/Milk

##### Allergy.aspx), an estimated 5% of babies are genuinely unable to handle the proteins found in milk or soy 

##### formula―a condition called Cow Milk Protein Intolerance/Allery (CMPI and CMPA). In either case, spitting up 

##### may serve as one of several cues your baby may give you that it's time to discuss alternative formulas with your 

##### pediatrician. If your baby does have a true intolerance, a 1or 2-week trial of hypoallergenic (hydrolyzed) formula 

##### designed to be better tolerated might be recommended by your baby's provider. 

##### If breastfeeding, consider your diet. Cow's milk and soy in your diet can worsen spit up in infants with Cow 

##### Milk Protein Intolerance/Allergy (CMPI and CMPA). Removing these proteins can help to reduce or eliminate 

##### spit up. 

##### Try a little oatmeal. Giving babies cereal before 6 months is generally not recommended—with one possible 

##### exception. Babies and children with dysphagia or reflux, for example, may need their food to be thicker in order 

##### to swallow safely or reduce reflux. In response to concerns over arsenic in rice (/English/ages

##### stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/reduce-arsenic.aspx), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) now 

#### recommends parents of children with these conditions use of oatmeal instead of rice cereal. See Oatmeal: The 

#### Safer Alternative for Infants & Children Who Need Thicker Food (/English/health

##### issues/conditions/abdominal/Pages/Oatmeal-The-Safer-Alternative-Need-Thicker-Food.aspx) for more 

##### information. 

### Vomit vs. spit up: what's the difference? 

##### There is a big difference between vomiting and spitting up: 

##### Vomiting is the forceful throwing up of stomach contents through the mouth. This typically involves using the 

##### abdominal muscles and is often uncomfortable, leaving you with a crying child. 

##### Spitting up is the easy flow of stomach contents out of the mouth, frequently with a burp. Spitting up doesn't 

##### involve forceful muscle contractions, brings up only small amounts of milk, and doesn't distress your baby or 

##### make them uncomfortable.

## Remember 

##### The best way to reduce spit up is to feed your baby before they get very hungry. Gently burp your baby when they take 

##### breaks during feedings. Limit active play after meals and hold your baby in an upright position for at least 20 minutes. 

##### Always closely supervise your baby during this time.

### What causes vomiting? 

##### Vomiting occurs when the abdominal muscles and diaphragm contract vigorously while the stomach is relaxed. 

##### This reflex action is triggered by the "vomiting center" in the brain after it has been stimulated by: 

##### Nerves from the stomach and intestine when the gastrointestinal tract is either irritated or swollen by an 

##### infection or blockage (as in the stomach bug) 

##### Chemicals in the blood such as drugs 

##### Psychological stimuli from disturbing sights or smells 

##### Stimuli from the middle ear (as in vomiting caused by motion sickness) 

##### Always contact your pediatrician if your baby vomits forcefully after every feeding or if there is ever blood 

##### in your baby's vomit.
