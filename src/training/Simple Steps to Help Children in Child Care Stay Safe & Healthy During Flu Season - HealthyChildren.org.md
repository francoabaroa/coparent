# Simple Steps to Help Children in Child Care Stay Safe & 

# Healthy During Flu Season 

## By: Andrew N. Hashikawa, MD, MS, FAAP 

## We have learned a lot recently about how to help kids 

## in child care avoid getting sick when respiratory 

## illnesses are spreading. 

## Still, infants in child care under age 6 months are too 

## young to get flu (influenza) or COVID vaccines. 

## Children younger than 2 years are too young to wear a 

## mask. Masks are recommended in areas with medium 

## and high community levels of COVID and any time 

## spread is more likely. 

## What can be done to keep children healthy? 

## Get a flu shot 

## For kids in child care settings, staying up to date on vaccines like flu vaccinations is key. Flu shots will not prevent 

## COVID, the cold, or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). But like these illnesses, the flu can make babies and young 

## children very sick. 

## Nearly every flu season, very young children are hit the hardest by the flu. In 2019-2020 (before the pandemic), a 

## record-breaking 199 children died from the flu (/English/health-issues/conditions/flu/Pages/default.aspx). Most who 

## died that year had not received flu vaccinations. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 

## by Dec. 31, the flu already led to 74 deaths among children this season. 

## Flu vaccines protect babies and young kids. That way, it is much less (https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/p0113

## flu-vaccine-children.html) likely they will need hospital care or die from flu complications. The American Academy of 

## Pediatrics recommends flu vaccines (/English/news/Pages/Influenza-Vaccines-Can-Protect-Children-against-the

## Flu-During-Pandemic.aspx) for babies and children 6 months of age and older. Your child can catch up on all 

## immunizations at a well-child visit (/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Recommended-Immunization

## Schedules.aspx). 

## And remember, parents and child care staff need annual flu shots, too. Child care staff may have received their COVID 

## vaccines. But COVID shots do not protect us from the flu. 

## It's not too late! 

## Many children still need to get a flu shot this season. The timing of flu season can change each year. Flu season 

## usually starts in October, peaks in February and may last into May. 

## Children are also still getting infected with COVID. Children eligible for a flu shot and COVID shot can get both at the 

## same visit. The AAP recommends COVID vaccines for everyone age 6 months and older. Adults and kids who are 

## eligible should get an updated COVID booster (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster

## shot.html), too, when it is time. (Read about COVID vaccines for kids here (/English/health-issues/conditions/COVID

## 19/Pages/Getting-Your-Child-Ready-for-the-COVID-19-Vaccine.aspx).) 

## Flu shots protect the people around us. 

## What happens at daycare when everyone is up to date on vaccinations? 

## Kids can stay in school and other activities. 


### Adults will not have to miss work or obligations. 

### We protect children who are too young to get vaccinated. 

### Community immunity through influenza vaccination helps keep those around us safe—people at high risk of 

### serious illness, like cancer patients and our grandparents. Older people (65 years and older 

### (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/65over.htm)) need flu shots, too. They are at higher risk of getting very sick 

### from the flu. 

## Serious flu illness and death can be (mostly) avoided. 

### We all know that little kids like to put everything in their mouths! Young children's immune systems are not fully 

### developed. Flu shots equip protect young kids' immune systems to resist influenza virus in child care. 

### So why do some children with the flu end up in the hospital? The flu can make their body very weak and dehydrated— 

### much more than a common cold. Children may need hospital care if their body becomes too weak from the flu. 

### Sometimes, children develop complications from being sick, like pneumonia (when the infection spreads to the 

### lungs). 

### There is no cure for the flu. Antiviral medicine can shorten the time that a person is sick. But they do not replace the 

### need to get a flu shot. 

## Remember 

### As we have learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, there is not one way to prevent illnesses at child care 

### (/English/health-issues/conditions/prevention/Pages/Prevention-In-Child-Care-or-School.aspx). But layers of 

### protection will keep us safe. This includes: 

### teaching young children how to wash their hands and use hand sanitizer when developmentally ready, 

### making sure that eligible children and staff are vaccinated 

### keeping everyone informed about child care sick-child policies so they know when a sick child should stay home 

### (/English/family-life/work-play/Pages/When-to-Keep-Your-Child-Home-from-Child-Care.aspx) 

### contacting your pediatrician if you have any questions about getting the flu shot. 

### When we all do our part, it keeps us healthy. It keeps our friends healthy—and it protects those at highest risk, too.
