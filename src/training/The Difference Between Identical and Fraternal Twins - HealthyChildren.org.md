# The Difference Between Identical and Fraternal Twins 

## Because fraternal, or dizygotic, twins are 2 separate fertilized eggs, they usually develop 2 separate amniotic sacs, 

## placentas, and supporting structures. Identical, or monozygotic, twins may or may not share the same amniotic sac, 

## depending on how early the single fertilized egg divides into 2. 

## If twins are a boy and a girl, clearly they are fraternal twins, as they do not have the same DNA. A boy has XY 

## chromosomes and a girl has XX chromosomes. Girl-boy twins occur when one X egg is fertilized with an X sperm, and 

## a Y sperm fertilizes the other X egg. 

## Sometimes health care professionals identify same-sex twins as fraternal or identical based on ultrasound findings or 

## by examining the membranes at the time of delivery. The best way to determine if twins are identical or fraternal is by 

## examining each child’s DNA. Occasionally a family is told that their twins are fraternal based on placenta findings, 

## when they are in fact identical. Other times, a family may see the minor differences in identical twins and declare the 

## twins fraternal based on these differences in appearance. There are a few commercial laboratories that, for a fee, will 

## send families DNA collection kits to determine if the twins are identical or fraternal. The families swab the insides of 

## each child’s cheek for a DNA sample and send the kit back to the laboratory to await results. 

## Identical twins have the same DNA; however, they may not look exactly identical to one another because of 

## environmental factors such as womb position and life experiences after being born. Our family joke about one of our 

## twin’s stitches for a lacerated upper lip was that he wanted to distinguish himself from his identical twin brother! In 

## addition to life’s bumps, bruises, and differing hairstyles, a child’s DNA is constantly adapting to that child’s 

## experiences. Different stretches of one’s DNA can turn on or off in response to environmental surroundings— 

## therefore, over time, a pair of identical twins’ DNA becomes more and more distinctive. All twins, whether fraternal or 

## identical, are truly 2 separate, unique individuals.
