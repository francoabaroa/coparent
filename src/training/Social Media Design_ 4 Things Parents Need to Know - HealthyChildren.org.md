# Social Media Design: 4 Things Parents Need to Know 

## By: Jenny Radesky, MD, FAAP & Megan Moreno, MD, FAAP 

## Social media sites such as Instagram, Snapchat, 

## Facebook, Discord, TikTok, YouTube, Twitch and Reddit 

## are incredibly popular among children and teens. Kids 

## seek social connection, entertainment and ideas 

## through social media. But as they interact with these 

## platforms, kids create a "digital footprint" that make 

## them the target of digital marketing and other content 

## aimed at influencing their behavior. 

## For parents who might have grown up watching 

## television and DVDs, it's important to understand the 

## unique design features of social media that can have positive or negative effects on your child. Here are 4 of these 

## features, paired with ways you can help your child understand and manage them. 

## 1. Personalization in social media 

## Social media personalization means that every child or teen has their own custom "feed." It includes 

## recommendations that suit their tastes and personality, based on what the platform learns about them as they use it. 

## Kids can follow their favorite celebrities, sports teams, creative interests, learn about new things and discover new 

## ideas. But a personalization also means that their feeds may be tailored with digital ads (/English/family

## life/Media/Pages/5-Unhealthy-Ways-Digital-Ads-May-Be-Targeting-Your-Child.aspx) or content that aren't in their 

## best interest. Think diet ads being sent to a teen with poor body image or conspiracy theory videos being sent to a teen 

## who likes science fiction. 

## What parents can do 

## Talk to your child about what shows up in their social media feeds: what is inspiring or hilarious? What is creepy or 

## annoying? Help them recognize that personalization on social media means they may be in their own "filter bubble." 

## This can prevent them from recognizing how other people from different backgrounds experience the online world. 

## If your child seems stressed out by social media, you can have them take a 2-week break and see how it feels. Or, 

## change up their feed by searching out more positive and inspiring content. 

## 2. Easy social connection 

## As soon as your child creates a social media account, it immediately seeks to access their contacts to build a big 

## network. In some ways, this can be good. It can let them easily keep in touch with family and friends, find support for 

## specific life experiences or medical conditions, for example. It also lets them build networks that include more diverse 

## groups of people and perspectives. 

## On the downside, if their social media account isn't private, they can be contacted by marketers or adults they don't 

## know. Another potential drawback is that seeing other "popular" users with a lot of followers and "likes" can make 

## teens feel more lonely. Plus, the ease of interacting over social media also means that kids and teens may be more 

## likely to post toxic or rude comments about each other – things they wouldn't necessarily have the nerve to say in real 

## life. 

## What parents can do 

## Your child or teens' social media settings should be set to private, so that strangers can't contact them. It's important to 

## monitor kids' social media interactions. However, the approach will depend on your relationship with your child. 


#### One solution that has worked for many parents is to make a deal with their child that they will occasionally look at 

#### their texts and social media feeds together. This way, parents can help their child navigate bullying (/English/family

#### life/Media/Pages/Cyberbullying.aspx) interactions, stand up for others or filter and block people who are behaving in 

#### toxic ways. Other parents may want to give their teens privacy, but check in from time to time by asking questions like 

#### "what's the craziest or coolest thing you saw online today?" Either way, opening the doors of communication about 

#### what kids and teens experience online is key. Show them that you have an open mind about what they are 

#### experiencing online and are there to help them. 

## 3. Social media content creation & "performance" 

#### Anyone with a smartphone can publish their thoughts, dance moves, musical talents or video game (/English/family

#### life/Media/Pages/Video-Games-Set-Your-Own-Ratings-System.aspx) expertise. This ready access allows or diverse 

#### children and teens have a voice in a world that is dominated by adults. It also means that some kids start to "perform" 

#### online in a way that isn't authentic to their inner true self. Instead, they may start to over-focus on "likes" and positive 

#### online feedback. Research has also found that content creators sometimes post racist or sexist material that doesn't 

#### get taken down by platforms. 

### What parents can do 

#### Does your child post their own material online? If possible, subscribe to their channel to get regular updates and 

#### monitor what they're posting. If you think they're getting too obsessed with their appearance or their "followers," have 

#### them take a break or find other ways they feel competent and valued. Also, help them recognize the subtle biases and 

#### inappropriate posts that may show up in their feed, so they can become more critical thinkers about what they see. 

## 4. Social media algorithm traps 

#### Social media algorithms, sets of mathematical rules based on what users have viewed before, determine what people 

#### see on their sites. This means that your child's feed will be filled with videos or posts that the platform predicted your 

#### child might click on. Research has found that algorithms can "pigeon-hole" users into feeds dominated by self-harm, 

#### eating disorder content or biased posts. 

#### Social media posts that are the most extreme – in terms of beauty, sexiness, violence or humor, for example – tend to 

#### get the most "engagement." Because of this, they are then amplified in users' recommendation feeds. This may lead to 

#### teens seeing more unrealistic views of beauty, wealth or behavior. In turn, it may influence their self-esteem or get 

#### them to take part in dangerous internet challenges (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/Dangerous-Internet

#### Challenges.aspx). 

### What parents can do 

#### Help your kids become savvy about ridiculous beauty standards, extreme stunts, challenges or over-the-top social 

#### media posts that may appear in their feed. Also help them understand that more extreme posts go "viral" because 

#### social media companies make more advertising money, and collect more data, when users are sharing and interacting 

#### more. 

## The big picture 

#### Whether your child is already on social media or they're asking you if they can start, be sure to go through your family 

#### rules for using it. You can make a family media plan (/English/fmp/Pages/MediaPlan.aspx) that everyone agrees to 

#### follow. Overall, it's important to be open-minded about the laughs and connections that teens get from social media. 

#### But it is also important to help them recognize behavior that is not authentic, misinformation and how they are 

#### profiled by companies. 

#### Keep channels of communication open about the whole family's media use. Consider how mhow it's affecting mood, 

#### sleep (/English/tips-tools/ask-the-pediatrician/Pages/My-teen-is-having-more-trouble-falling-asleep.aspx), or family 

#### interactions, and whether it's a positive force in your lives or becoming a time-waster.
