# Toddlers and Breastfeeding 

## My toddler wants to breastfeed only when he’s upset or 

## tired. Is it healthy to continue breastfeeding if nursing 

## has turned into a comfort ritual more than anything 

## else? 

## Your toddler may turn to nursing for comfort and reassurance, but he is certainly still benefiting 

## from the nutritional and immunologic benefits. In any case, emotional support is a perfectly legitimate aspect of 

## breastfeeding. 

## Seeking out a reassuring nursing session when he’s upset and bouncing back as soon as he finishes builds your 

## child’s confidence and feelings of security and well-being. Certainly there is no evidence that extended breastfeeding 

## makes a child more dependent or harms him in any way. 

## On the contrary, many parents proudly tell how independent, healthy, and exceptionally bright their long-term 

## breastfed children become. As long as you are comfortable breastfeeding your toddler, there is no reason to stop.
