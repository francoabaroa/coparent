# Clogged Milk Ducts 

## Sometime during the course of breastfeeding, you may experience a sore breast or notice a small 

## lump on your breast that may be red or irritated and hurts when you touch it. This lump may be 

## the result of a clogged milk duct, which can happen if there’s an abrupt change in the feeding 

## schedule, inadequate draining of the breast, not varying nursing positions, or wearing clothes or 

## bras that are too tight. 

## Treatment 

## A clogged duct should be dealt with immediately since it can lead to a breast infection. The best 

## initial treatment for a clogged duct is to continue nursing, taking care to drain the breast as much as possible with 

## each feeding. (If you suddenly stop breastfeeding, your breast will probably become engorged, which could make the 

## condition worse and lead to an infection.) 

## Before each feeding, gently massage the breast, beginning on the outside and working your way toward the nipple, 

## paying particular attention to the firm area. Breastfeed as often and as long as possible, offering your baby the sore 

## breast first if you can tolerate it, because your baby will nurse most vigorously on the first breast, thus draining it more 

## effectively. 

## Try switching positions to allow better drainage. Express milk from that breast after each feeding if your baby has not 

## completely relieved breast fullness. Apply comfortably warm, moist towels on the affected breast several times a day 

## (or take several warm baths or showers), gently massaging the area around the clogged duct down toward the nipple. 

## If the lump on your breast remains for more than a few days, if it increases in size or redness, or if you develop a fever 

## or significant discomfort, make an appointment to see your doctor. 

## Prevention 

## Keeping pressure off your breasts will help prevent clogged ducts. You can do this by wearing clothing that is not 

## restrictive (avoid tight tops, bras, or underwire bras; if necessary, switch to a larger bra size, or go without a bra for a 

## while); by changing your nursing position so that your baby drains the milk from all areas of the breast equally; and by 

## not sleeping on your stomach. 

## If you notice dried milk plugging the openings in your nipples, wash them gently with warm water after each 

## breastfeeding session. Continued difficulties with clogged ducts may signal a problem with your baby’s latching on or 

## with your nursing position. Arrange for a visit with your pediatrician or lactation specialist to correct these problems.
