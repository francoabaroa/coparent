# Shoes for Active Toddlers 

## In the early months, babies' feet (/English/ages

## stages/baby/Pages/Babys-Changing-Feet.aspx) develop best if 

## they're not confined in shoes; socks are all that's needed to keep 

## their feet warm; however, once children start walking outdoors, 

## they need shoes for protection. 

## Shoe Shopping Tips for Parents 

## Look for comfortable shoes with nonskid soles, such as 

## sneakers, that will help keep your toddler steady on slippery 

## floors. 

## Buy well-made shoes, but don't spend a lot of money. 

## At this stage, your child's feet grow so rapidly that the first pair of shoes won't last more than 2 or 3 months. 

## Checking the Fit 

## You should check the fit about once a month; the top of your child's big toe should be about finger-width distance 

## from the inside edge of the shoe. It's better to have no shoes at all than shoes that are too tight. 

## Common Concerns from Parents 

## "My 15 month old is showing no signs of getting ready to walk. He shows little 

## interest in moving about." 

## Possible cause: Developmental delay (/English/ages-stages/toddler/Pages/Assessing-Developmental

## Delays.aspx) 

## What parents should do: Talk with your pediatrician to arrange an evaluation of your toddler's development. 

## "My child turns her toes noticeably inward when she walks." 

## Possible cause: Normal developmental stage 

## What parents should do: This tendency usually disappears as your child matures. It rarely interferes with 

## mobility. See Pigeon Toes (Intoeing) (/English/health-issues/conditions/orthopedic/Pages/Pigeon-Toes

## Intoeing.aspx). 

## "My child is limping. She is complaining of pain." 

## Possible cause: Injury, infection, arthritis (/English/health-issues/conditions/orthopedic/Pages/Arthritis.aspx), 

## or another condition that requires treatment 

## What parents should do: If you can't see and remove an obvious source of pain, such as a splinter 

## (/English/health-issues/conditions/skin/Pages/Splinters-and-Other-Foreign-Bodies-in-the-Skin.aspx), ask your 

## pediatrician to determine the cause of the limp. 

## "My child limps but isn't complaining of pain. He walks with a waddling gait." 

## Possible cause: Neuromuscular weakness or hip joint disorder (/English/health

## issues/conditions/orthopedic/Pages/Hip-Dysplasia.aspx) 

## What parents should do: Talk with your pediatrician, who will examine your child and determine whether he 

## should be seen by another pediatric specialist.

## "My child often walks on the balls of her feet after many months of walking." 

### Possible cause: Habit or a neuromuscular problem 

### What parents should do: Although normal during early walking, walking on the toes or the balls of the feet after 

### 2 years of age should be evaluated. Ask your pediatrician to determine whether your child has a problem that 

### requires treatment. 

## "My toddler has difficulty walking. He falls a lot and has trouble getting on his 

## feet again. He uses his hands to climb up his legs when trying to stand. He tends 

## to waddle when he walks." 

### Possible cause: Muscular dystrophy or another neuromuscular condition that requires diagnosis and treatment 

### What parents should do: Call your pediatrician, who will examine your child and may refer you to another 

### pediatric specialist. If the diagnosis is confirmed, your child will need long-term treatment. Your pediatrician will 

### also help you find support groups for children and parents.
