## These tips are helpful for all children, but they can be especially helpful for children with anxiety. Parenting is a busy 

## job, so use your judgment about which tips make the most sense for your family. 

## Connect with your child 

## Set aside one-on-one time every day without TV or other media (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/social

## media-and-your-childs-mental-health-what-research-says.aspx). Even just 10 minutes each day can make a 

## big difference. Try gardening or taking care of houseplants, drawing or going for a bike ride. 

## Praise your child and make them feel good about themselves. For example, "You did a great job on that 

## homework assignment!" or "Thank you for helping me with the laundry. I'm so lucky to have your help." 

## Find out what's worrying your child , because stress can make them feel anxious. Things such as being bullied 

## at school, divorce, or a death in the family can make a child feel anxious. Your child may need extra help to 

## handle issues such as these. 

## Help your child learn to manage fears 

## When your child is calm, start a conversation about things they can do to manage fears and worries when they 

## happen. For example, let them know that they can 


#### Practice deep breathing and muscle relaxation. 

#### Use positive self-talk (for example, "I can try this" instead of "I can't do this"). 

#### Think of a safe place , such as their bedroom or favorite place outdoors. 

#### Gradually facing fears. Consider gradually exposing your child to feared objects or activities. 

#### Praise and reward brave behavio r: the goal is to cope, not avoid. 

### Build healthy habits 

#### Healthy lifestyle habits can help reduce stress and support a positive mood (/English/health

#### issues/conditions/COVID-19/Pages/Mood-Boosting-Tips-for-Families-COVID-19.aspx). 

#### Get active! Encourage your child to be active for at least an hour every day. This activity can include playing 

#### outside, joining a sports team or an activity at the YMCA, biking or walking to school (/English/safety

#### prevention/on-the-go/Pages/Safety-On-The-Way-To-School.aspx), or dancing at home to favorite music. 

#### Eat healthy. Eat healthy meals every day, including fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and protein foods. 

#### Remember to eat breakfast! 

#### Get plenty of sleep (/English/healthy-living/sleep/Pages/healthy-sleep-habits-how-many-hours-does

#### your-child-need.aspx). School-aged children need 9 to 12 hours of sleep every night, and teens need 8 to 10 

#### hours. 

#### Build a family media plan (/English/fmp/Pages/MediaPlan.aspx) to set healthy guidelines around 

#### entertainment screen time. Avoid scary or violent TV shows, video games, and movies. 

#### Set up family routines. Follow a regular schedule for playtime, mealtime, and bedtime. Knowing what to expect 

#### can help your child feel safe and secure. 

## How can I help my child manage school anxiety? 

#### Children may find it hard to focus on or even go to school when they're feeling worried. If your child is having trouble 

#### in school, try these ways to help. 

#### Gently but firmly tell your child why it's important to go to school (/English/ages

#### stages/gradeschool/school/Pages/School-Attendance-Truancy-Chronic-Absenteeism.aspx). 

#### Talk with your child's teachers and the guidance counselor about what to do if your child asks to go home 

#### from school early. 

#### If you think your child may be upset by family stress or pressure to do well in school , let them know they are 

#### doing a good job and you're proud of them. 

#### Help your child set realistic goals for school. If they set goals that are too hard to meet, they may feel worse 

#### about themselves. 

#### Remind your child that they can take steps to control their worries. For example, they can think about what 

#### to do ahead of time to handle a stressful situation. 

#### Reward your child's brave behaviors at school. Spending time doing fun activities with a parent is a very 

#### powerful reward. 

## Remember, you know your child best. 

#### Whether it's at school or the doctor's office, you are your child's biggest advocate. Don't hesitate to speak up on behalf 

#### of your child. 

## When do I need to go back to the doctor? 

#### If your child's anxiety doesn't go away or gets worse, get back in touch with the doctor. You and the doctor can make a 

#### plan to try new approaches or strategies with your child. 

### It's especially important to talk with your child's doctor if: 

#### Your child starts to experience other behavior problems , such as shyness. 

##### Back to Top 


#### Something scary happens in your child's life that may make their anxiety worse , such as an injury or death 

#### in the family. 

#### You suspect your child's anxiety is affecting another medical condition (for example, if your child's asthma 

#### gets worse with anxiety). 

#### The doctor can also help you decide whether visiting a specialist may help. For example, a type of therapy called 

#### cognitive behavioral therapy can be helpful for children with anxiety. 

## Make time to care for yourself, too. 

#### Parenting can be stressful. If you're feeling overwhelmed (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/Pages/Feeling

#### Overwhelmed-with-Parenting-Demands.aspx), don't be afraid to ask for support from family, close friends, social 

#### services, or your faith community. Children pick up on the stress and worries of adults, so getting support for yourself 

#### can help your child too.
