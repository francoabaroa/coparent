# Diapers: Disposable or Cloth? 

## By: Laura A. Jana, MD, FAAP and Jennifer Shu, MD, FAAP 

## As a new parent, you may not have heard of the ongoing 

## cloth versus disposable diaper debate. Use of disposable 

## diapers has become so accepted as a modern-day 

## convenience that many parents wouldn't dream of 

## using a substitute. In contrast to 1955, when essentially 

## all American babies wore cloth diapers, an estimated 

## 90% (or even 95%) of 21st century American babies are 

## sporting the latest in disposable fashions. 

## While a simple internet search on the subject quickly 

## makes it clear how strongly some people feel about the 

## cloth versus disposable debate, we have no intention of taking sides. Instead, we figure we'd offer you some facts and 

## practical advice related to the use of each type, with the rest of our information weighted toward disposable use only 

## because it is applicable to a majority of parents these days. 

## Disposable. Disposable diapers are very absorbent, a feature that can be good and bad. Using them may mean 

## your baby's skin has less contact with pee and poop and may offer the added convenience of less frequent 

## changing. However, it may also be more difficult to monitor exactly how much your baby is peeing—a task that is 

## especially important during the newborn period, as well as when you're faced with watching for signs of 

## dehydration. 

## Some cloth diaper advocates argue that babies in disposable diapers have a much higher incidence of diaper rash 

## (presumably due to longer contact with diaper contents resulting from less frequent changing). Interestingly, 

## however, one of the commonly recommended approaches to treating Diaper rashes is for cloth diaper users to switch 

## to disposable. Also garnishing a lot of attention is the fact that “disposable" diapers are not biodegradable, and billions 

## (with estimates around 20 billion diapers, or 3.5 million tons) make their way into landfills each year. 

## We have been happy to learn that some communities have begun recycling or responsibly composting used 

## disposable diapers, while some of the country's leading diaper makers seem to be making an effort to be more eco

## friendly, improving everything from the materials they use to the amount, transport, and packaging of diapers. We 

## certainly hope that this sustainability-minded approach continues across the entire disposable diaper industry. 

## Cloth. Cloth diapers are supposedly more comfortable than disposable diapers (we say supposedly because 

## neither of us has any personal recollection, and we aren't exactly sure how one would otherwise prove such a 

## claim). Proponents also claim that babies who wear cloth diapers are five times less likely to develop diaper 

## rashes than their disposable diaper-clad counterparts. But unlike disposable diapers, cloth diapers are not as 

## absorbent, need to be changed more frequently, and usually need to be worn with an overlying stay-dry cover. 

## These covers typically come in the form of plastic, cotton, or terry cloth. 

## Do you see what I pee? 

## Disposable diapers these days are so effective at absorbing whatever pee may come their way, they can actually 

## pose a challenge to parents who are trying to keep close tabs on just how much their newborns are peeing. 

## Fortunately, some diaper brands now come with a colorfully effective solution: a strip on the diaper that changes 

## color when wet, allowing you to more clearly see when your baby pees. 


##### As for the materials used to make them, cloth diapers have long been made of cotton—a material that is notorious for 

##### requiring a lot of water to produce. Those focused on reducing the environmental impact of diapering point to 

##### bamboo-based cloth diapers as more eco-friendly, as well as a more readily available alternative to cotton. 

##### And because cloth diapers (and their covers) require a lot of washing by either the parents or a diaper service and 

##### therefore use a great deal of water and detergent, people in the disposable diaper camp point out that cloth diapers 

##### also have a negative effect on the environment—especially when they are washed in small, half-full loads of laundry, 

##### put into a dryer instead of line dried, or both washed and dried.

### An environmentally superior diaper? 

##### One of the most significant concerns parents have when it comes to the use of diapers these days is the effect they 

##### have on the environment—a concern that is well worth paying attention to. What may come as a surprise, 

##### however, is that it's in no way clear that disposable diapers have any greater effect than their cloth counterparts. 

##### Both disposable and cloth diapers have an effect on the environment that is determined by taking into account the 

##### full “life cycle" of the diaper, from start to final use. This includes how much energy, water, and raw materials are 

##### used, as well as how much atmospheric emissions and waterborne and solid wastes are created. 

##### While studies suggest that disposable diapers use more raw materials and produce more solid wastes, cloth diaper 

##### use potentially consumes significantly more water and produces more waterborne wastes. The conclusion: we 

##### wish we had a definitive one for you. When it comes to declaring environmental superiority of cloth versus 

##### disposable diapers, it still seems to be a wash.
