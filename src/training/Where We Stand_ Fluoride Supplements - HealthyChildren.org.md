# Where We Stand: Fluoride Supplements 

## Babies under 6 months old should not get fluoride 

## supplements. After that time, however, breastfed and 

## formula-fed infants need appropriate fluoride 

## supplementation if local drinking water contains less 

## than 0.3 parts per million (ppm) of fluoride. 

## If your home is supplied by its own well , have 

## the well tested to determine the amount of natural 

## fluoride in the water. If your baby consumes 

## bottled water instead or your home is connected 

## to a municipal water supply, check to see if the 

## water is fluoridated (/English/healthy-living/oral

## health/Pages/Water-Fluoridation.aspx). 

## If your family prefers bottled water , you should consider purchasing water marketed for babies with fluoride 

## added; sometimes called "nursery water." It is available in the baby food aisle in grocery stores, and can be used 

## when mixing formula (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/How-to-Safely-Prepare-Formula

## with-Water.aspx). 

## Your pediatrician or pediatric dentist (/English/family-life/health-management/pediatric-specialists/Pages/What-is

## a-Pediatric-Dentist.aspx) can advise you on whether there is a need for fluoride drops for your baby and prescribe the 

## appropriate dosage. Formula-fed infants receive some fluoride from their formula if the drinking water is fluoridated. 

## The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that you check with your pediatrician or pediatric dentist 

## to find out if any additional fluoride supplements are necessary. 

## Remember, appropriate fluoride supplementation is based on each child's unique needs. A supplement should be 

## considered by you and your doctor until all of a child's permanent teeth are present in the mouth.
