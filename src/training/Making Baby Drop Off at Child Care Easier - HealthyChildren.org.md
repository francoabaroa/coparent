# Making Baby Drop Off at Child Care Easier 

## Getting the day started can be a challenge. So here are some 

## suggestions to make your separation (/English/ages

## stages/toddler/Pages/Soothing-Your-Childs-Separation

## Anxiety.aspx) at the child care setting a little easier for both of you. 

## 0 to 7 months 

## In early infancy your baby primarily needs love, comforting, 

## and good basic care to satisfy his physical needs. 

## Although this period may be a difficult time of separation for 

## you, young infants generally will transition to a consistent 

## child care worker in almost any setting. Be patient during this initial settling-in period. 

## 7 to 12 months 

## Stranger anxiety (/English/ages-stages/toddler/Pages/Soothing-Your-Childs-Separation-Anxiety.aspx) normally 

## occurs at this time. Suddenly your baby may be reluctant to stay with anyone outside his family. The unfamiliar 

## setting of a child care center also may upset him. 

## If possible, do not start child care during this period, or just ease into it. If your child is already in a program, take 

## a little extra time each day before you say good-bye. Create a short good-bye ritual, perhaps letting him hold a 

## favorite stuffed animal. Say good-bye and then quietly leave. Above all, be consistent from day to day. 

## 12 to 24 months 

## This is when separation anxiety peaks and your child has the most difficulty with your leaving. He may not 

## believe that you will return, and may weep and clip to you as you try to leave. 

## Be understanding but firm and persistent. Reassure him that you will return when you're done with work 

## (/English/family-life/work-play/Pages/Working-Parents.aspx) or have finished your errands. Once you have left, 

## do not reappear unless you are prepared to stay or walk with your child to the door.
