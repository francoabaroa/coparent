# Where We Stand: Vitamin D & Iron Supplements for 

# Babies 

## The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends infants 

## be fed breast milk (also known as human milk) exclusively for the 

## first 6 months after birth. Human milk contains a natural balance 

## of vitamins, especially C, E and the B vitamins. So, if you and your 

## baby are both healthy, and you are well nourished, your child may 

## not require any supplements of these vitamins. However, breastfed 

## infants need supplemental vitamin D. 

## Why do babies need vitamin D 

## supplements? 

## Our bodies need sunlight to produce vitamin D, which is why exposure to sunlight is good in moderation. However, 

## children should wear sunscreen, hats, and protective clothing when outdoors for extended periods of time to prevent 

## sunburn and reduce the risk of skin cancer later in life. For this reason, the AAP recommends that all infants receive a 

## vitamin D supplement (unless they are consuming more than 27 ounces per day of commercial formula that has the 

## vitamin D supplement added. 

## How much vitamin D do babies need? 

## Vitamin D supplements of 400 IU (10 mcg) per day are recommended for babies up until age one year, with 600 IU (15 

## mcg) per day for children over one year. Talk to your pediatrician about supplemental vitamin D drops. 

## Do babies need iron supplements? 

## For the first four months, your breastfed baby needs no additional iron. The iron in their body at birth was enough for 

## their initial growth. But now the reserves will be low and as their growth increases, so will their need for iron. At four 

## months of age infants who are partially or completely breastfeeding should be supplemented with 1 mg/kg per day of 

## oral iron until appropriate iron-containing complementary foods (including iron-fortified cereals) are introduced in 

## their diet. 

## If there were pregnancy or birth complications such as diabetes, low birth weight, or prematurity, or if your baby was 

## small for gestational age and is taking breast milk, iron supplementation may start in the first month after birth. 

## Fortunately, once you start your baby on solid foods, they’ll also receive iron from meats, iron-fortified cereals and 

## green vegetables.
