# Forms of Baby Formula: Powder, Concentrate & Ready-to

# Feed 

## By: Laura Jana, MD, FAAP & Jennifer Shu, MD, FAAP 

## Infant formulas generally come as ready-to-feed liquid, 

## concentrated liquid and powder. Which type is going to work best 

## for you is likely to depend on how much formula you plan to use, 

## where you plan to use it and how much you want to spend. 

## Start thinking in ounces 

## Bottle-feeding your baby will require you to think in ounces and 

## adopt it as your standard unit of measurement. 

## Here are the basic measurements you'll need for formula 

## success: 

## 1 ounce = 30 cc (cubic centimeters) = 30 mL (milliliters) 

## 8 fluid ounces = 1 cup 

## 32 fluid ounces = 1 quart 

## Formula prep by form 

## Powder. The simple concept here is that you add powder to premeasured water and shake a lot. In what we can 

## only assume was an enlightened attempt to eliminate room for mixing errors, most powdered formula is mixed 

## according to the same recipe: 1 scoop of powder to every 2 fluid ounces of water. Powdered formula comes in 

## cans containing enough powder to make anywhere from 90 ounces to more than 200 ounces of prepared 

## formula. It is certainly your most economical choice, and quite frankly works perfectly well for most babies. You 

## can decide whether to mix it up as you go or prepare a full day's worth at a time and refrigerate it for up to 24 

## hours. 

## Liquid concentrate. This is the "just add water as directed and shake" formula option. Mixing and measuring is 

## again quite straightforward, because all brands of concentrate call for equal amounts of water and concentrate. If 

## you intend to end up with a total of 4 fluid ounces of prepared formula, you'll need to mix 2 fluid ounces of 

## concentrate with 2 fluid ounces of water. Of course, many people choose to mix an entire can of concentrate 

## (13 fluid ounces) with an equal amount of water. The resulting 26 fluid ounces of now-ready-to-feed formula can 

## be covered and put in the refrigerator to be used over the next 48 hours. While some parents find concentrate to 

## be easier, neater, and/or more convenient than powder, it is a convenience for which you will pay more. 

## Ready-to-feed. This is your no-mixing, no-measuring, no-mess option. Typically sold in 2-,6-or 8-fluid-ounce 

## containers (with anywhere from 4 to 24 to a pack) or 1-quart (32-fluid-ounce) containers/cans, the use of ready

## to-feed formula is hopefully self-explanatoryâ€” what you see is what you give. While the fairly small "Ready-to

## Feed" caption isn't always prominently displayed on the label, you'd be hard pressed to miss the distinguishing 

## price tag. While buying ready-to-feed formula inevitably costs the most, it leaves almost no room for error 

## (assuming you don't mistake it for concentrate and dilute it with water). Unopened ready-to-feed formula can be 

## conveniently stored at room temperature. Once opened, unused portions can be covered and then refrigerated 

## for up to 48 hours.
