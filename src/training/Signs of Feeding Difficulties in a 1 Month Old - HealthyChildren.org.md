# Signs of Feeding Difficulties in a 1 Month Old 

## The following are some possible warning signs of feeding problems, 

## and should be discussed with your pediatrician. 

## Too Much Feeding: 

## If bottle-fed (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding

## nutrition/Pages/Amount-and-Schedule-of-Formula

## Feedings.aspx), the baby is consuming more than 4 to 6 ounces 

## (120 to 180 mL) per feeding. 

## She vomits (/English/health

## issues/conditions/abdominal/Pages/Infant-Vomiting.aspx) 

## most or all the food after a complete feeding. 

## Her stools are loose and very watery (/English/ages-stages/baby/diapers-clothing/Pages/Diarrhea-in

## Babies.aspx), eight or more times a day. (Keep in mind that breastfed babies normally tend to have much more 

## frequent and looser stools.) 

## Too Little Feeding: 

## If breastfed (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/pages/Monitoring-Your-Baby%27s-Feeding.aspx), the 

## baby stops feeding after ten minutes or less. 

## She wets fewer than four diapers per day; particularly if she has begun sleeping through the night, she may be 

## feeding inadequately (since most babies feed at least once during the night), and may urinate less often and 

## become mildly dehydrated. 

## She has infrequent or very hard stools (/English/ages-stages/baby/diapers-clothing/Pages/Infant

## Constipation.aspx) in the first month. 

## She appears hungry, searching for something to suck shortly after feedings. 

## She becomes more yellow (/English/news/Pages/Jaundice-in-Newborns.aspx), instead of less, during the first 

## week. 

## Feeding Allergy or Digestive Disturbance: 

## Your baby vomits most or all food after a complete feeding. 

## She produces loose and very watery stools eight or more times a day or has blood in the stools. 

## She has a severe skin rash.
