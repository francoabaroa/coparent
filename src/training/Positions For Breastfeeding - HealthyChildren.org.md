# Positions For Breastfeeding 

## Most new mothers first try breastfeeding sitting up in a 

## hospital bed, with the baby supported by a pillow in 

## their lap and cradled in their arms. If you choose this 

## position, elevate the head of the bed as much as 

## possible and place pillows behind you until your back is 

## comfortable. Place your baby on a pillow on your lap 

## (this is an especially good idea if you've given birth by 

## cesarean section, or C-section (/English/ages

## stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Breastfeeding-After

## Cesarean-Delivery.aspx)) so his head is level with your 

## breast. Put pillows at your sides to rest your arms on so 

## they won't tire in mid-feeding. 

## Get comfortable 

## At home, you may find an armchair helpful. If you breastfeed while sitting in a chair, be sure it offers sturdy back and 

## arm support and is not too low or high. A pillow or two tucked behind your back can make nursing in a chair more 

## comfortable, as can a low footstool to support your legs. It is always important to make sure that you are comfortable 

## before beginning the feeding. 

## Whether you are sitting up in bed or have settled into an armchair, keep your back straight but relaxed as you offer 

## your baby the breast. Your baby may find it more difficult to latch on properly if you are leaning forward or back. This 

## changes the angle at which the baby receives the breast, and your back may soon feel the strain of this as well. If your 

## breasts are large, you might want to place a rolled-up towel or receiving blanket beneath your breast to keep your 

## baby's mouth at a straight-on angle with the nipple, in addition to supporting the breast with your hand. 

## Once you are comfortably positioned, you can hold your baby in a number of ways. As you practice breastfeeding 

## before leaving the hospital, try several positions (for both your baby and yourself) and ask your nurse or lactation 

## specialist for assistance if needed. Feeding in more than one position can help prevent nipple soreness and clogged 

## milk ducts, since different positions drain different areas of the breast more effectively. Some positions also work 

## better than others in certain circumstances. 

## All of these positions described are for guidance only. There is not an absolute right or wrong way to hold your baby 

## for breastfeeding. Every mother and baby find the positions that work well for them. If you are a first-time 

## breastfeeding mother, however, you may find the following guidance helpful for getting started. 

## The cradle hold 

## The traditional position is called the cradle hold or Madonna hold. For this position, support 

## your baby on the arm that's on the same side as the breast you intend to use. Holding your 

## upper arm close to your body, rest your baby's head in the crook of your elbow, support his 

## back with your forearm, and cup his bottom or upper thigh with your hand. His arm may be 

## positioned around your body or tucked slightly under his body to keep it out of the way. 

## Once he's properly supported, rotate your forearm so his entire body turns toward you. His 

## pelvis should be up against your abdomen, his chest against your chest, and his mouth lined 

## up with your nipple. You can now bring your baby's mouth to the nipple (rather than the 

## nipple to his mouth) without making him turn his head to the side. It is important for your 

## baby's head to be aligned with the rest of his body instead of turned off to the side. 

## The cross-cradle hold 

## A variation on the cradle hold, the cross-cradle or crossover hold involves the same positioning except you support 

## your baby on the arm opposite the breast being used. In this position, your hand supports your baby's neck and upper 

## back, rather than his bottom, and his bottom rests either in the crook of your arm or on the pillow on your lap. Again, 


#### rotate your baby's body so it faces you and his mouth is lined up with your nipple. This is a good position for a baby 

#### who has difficulty latching on, because you can more easily guide his head into a better position by holding the back of 

#### his neck between your thumb and fingers. You may use your hand to support the breast while helping your baby to 

#### latch. 

## The laid-back position 

### Laid-back breastfeeding positioning takes advantage of the biologic responses that occur when the baby is skin-to

### skin with the mother in a prone position. This position is sometimes referred to as the Australian or down-under 

#### position. The mother lies semi-reclined on her back, with the baby lying stomach-to-stomach on top of her. This 

#### position is especially useful for mothers who have an overactive let-down reflex or an overabundant milk supply. 

## The side-sitting, clutch or football Hold 

### Many breastfeeding women find that the side-sitting hold, also known as a clutch hold or 

### football hold, is an easier position to maintain. This may be especially true for those who 

#### have given birth by cesarean delivery, because it keeps the baby's weight off the abdominal 

#### incision. The clutch hold may also be useful for mothers of twins since one baby can nurse 

#### on each side; for women with large breasts or flat nipples since the mother can see both her 

#### nipple and her baby's mouth and can easily control the baby's head; and also for premature 

#### babies. In a clutch hold, your baby is held similarly to how you would hold a handbag 

#### clutched under your arm or a football clutched close to your body. 

#### To feed your baby in this position, place him beside you—on the side of the breast you will 

#### use—with his head near your breast. Tuck his body up against your side, under your arm. 

#### Your forearm should support his upper back, and your hand and fingers should support his shoulders, neck, and head. 

#### His legs will stretch out straight behind you or, if you are in a chair, you can rest his bottom against the back of the 

#### chair and angle his legs straight up. Finally, place a pillow under your elbow for support, keep your baby's head level 

#### with your breast. 

## Reclining or lying down 

### You may find that feeding your baby in a reclining position, rather than sitting, allows 

#### for some welcome relaxation. Nursing while lying down helps particularly if you have 

#### had a cesarean delivery or otherwise feel tired or unwell in the days following 

#### childbirth. To do this, lie on your side with one or more pillows behind your back and 

#### under your head for support. (A pillow placed between your knees may make you 

#### more comfortable.) Keep your back and hips in as straight a line as possible. Hold your 

#### baby closely on his side so he faces you with his mouth with your arm around him. You 

#### may use your hand to support the breast while helping the baby to latch. 

#### An advantage of this position is you don't have to get up to reposition your baby on 

#### your other breast. Simply place a pillow under him to elevate him until he's parallel with your upper breast and lean 

#### over farther to bring the upper breast to him. Or, if you prefer, hug him to your chest, roll over to your other side, and 

#### reposition him. You can support your baby by placing a pillow or rolled-up blanket behind his back, which gives your 

#### lower arm a rest. 

## Remember 

#### Once you and your baby have become pros at breastfeeding, you'll be able to nurse while talking on the phone, reading 

#### a book, supervising your other children, or walking around. If you have any questions about breastfeeding your baby, 

#### talk with your pediatrician.
