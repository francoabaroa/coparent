# Talking About 13 Reasons Why & Teen Suicide: Tips for 

# Parents 

## When the Netflix series "13 Reasons Why" premiered in 

## 2017, it quickly became one of the most watched—and 

## most controversial—shows aimed at teen viewers. 

## With its third season expected to release in 2019, the 

## series continues to spark debate over how the show 

## portrays teen suicide (/English/health

## issues/conditions/emotional-problems/Pages/ten

## things-parents-can-do-to-prevent-suicide.aspx) and its 

## possible effect on viewers. 

## Raising Awareness–and Risk? 

## The drama centers on a high school student who died by suicide and leaves behind 13 audiotapes for people she 

## blames for her action. 

## Fans of the series say it increases much-needed awareness about teen suicide, currently the second leading cause of 

## death for children and young people 10 to 24 years old. In addition to graphic portrayal of suicide, the show also 

## focuses on bullying (/English/safety-prevention/at-play/Pages/Bullying-Its-Not-Ok.aspx) and cyberbullying 

## (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/Cyberbullying.aspx), underage drinking (/English/news/Pages/AAP-Policy

## Statement-Underage-Drinking-and-Associated-Risks.aspx), sexual assault (/English/news/Pages/AAP-Updates

## Recommendations-on-Caring-for-Teens-After-Sexual-Assault.aspx), guns in the home (/English/safety-prevention/at

## home/Pages/Handguns-in-the-Home.aspx), school violence (/English/news/Pages/AAP-Offers-Resources-to-Help

## Parents,-Children-and-Others-Cope-in-the-Aftermath-of-School-Violence.aspx), and other discussion-worthy topics. 

## But some experts warn the show may do more harm than good. Although the series is fictional, teens can be impulsive 

## and emotional. Watching a character decide to commit suicide might trigger them to do the same. After the show was 

## released, medical and mental health professionals reported teens listing their own 13 reasons why they wanted to kill 

## themselves. Some families said they believe the show triggered their children to actually take their lives. 

## According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2017 youth survey 

## results (https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/pdf/trendsreport.pdf): 

## 32% of high school students experienced ongoing feelings of sadness or hopelessness 

## 17 % said they'd seriously considered attempting suicide. 

## 14 % made a suicide plan 

## 7% tried to kill themselves 

## Is Suicide "Contagious?" 

## Research suggests that exposure to a peer's suicide can, in fact, have a "contagious" effect—especially among 12to 13

## year-olds. After reviewing more than 50 international studies, a group of major health and media organizations 

## developed recommendations that advise against "presenting suicide as a tool for accomplishing certain ends, such as 

## revenge or recognition," or "glorifying suicide or persons who commit suicide." 


### Can exposure to a fictional character's suicide also have a "copycat" effect? 

#### Since the premiere of "13 Reasons Why," researchers have been trying to answer that question. Among the findings: 

#### ● In the days following the premier of "13 Reasons Why," researchers found a significant spike in internet 

#### searches (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2646773) using terms such as 

#### "how to commit suicide" and "how to kill yourself." 

#### ● A more recent study funded by the National Institutes of Health (https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news

#### releases/release-13-reasons-why-associated-increase-youth-suicide-rates) found a 29% increase in suicide 

#### among U.S. adolescents between ages 10-17 after the release of season 1. In April 2017, the month after Netflix 

#### released all 13 episodes for streaming, the teen suicide rate in this age group reached a 19-year high. It remained 

#### high the rest of the year, with 195 more suicides reported in this age group than would have been expected. 

#### ● Another new study (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953619302072?via%3Dihub) 

#### found that students between 18-29 who watched the show's entire second season had fewer thoughts of suicide 

#### and greater interest in helping someone feeling suicidal than those who didn't view any episodes; however, the 

#### researchers also found students who watched only part of season 2 showed higher suicide risk and less optimism 

#### about the future. 

## How to Help Teens Process the Show in a Safe & Healthy Way: 

#### Despite concerns about "13 Reasons Why," the show can serve as a powerful teaching tool with informed, adult 

#### guidance from parents, teachers, spiritual leaders, and others who work with teens. 

### What parents can do: 

#### ● Co-view. The AAP media use guidelines (http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2016

#### 2592) encourage parents to co-view programs with their children and discuss what they are seeing. This is 

#### especially important for shows such as "13 Reasons Why" with themes difficult to process and easy to 

#### misinterpret. Watching the show together lets parents pause and point out instances of cyberbullying, for 

#### example. Then parents can ask if their child has seen it happen at school, how he or she reacted, and what to do if 

#### it happens again. 

#### ○ Children in groups at a higher risk for suicidal thoughts and actions should not watch the show alone, 

#### said Cora Breuner, MD, MPH, FAAP, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Committee on 

#### Adolescence. This includes kids with a family history of suicide, a history of physical or sexual abuse, mood 

#### disorders, and drug and alcohol use, and/or those who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or 

#### questioning.

#### ● Discuss reality vs. fiction. Explain that the show gives an unrealistic view of the help available for teens who 

#### may feel suicidal. In particular, the lack of effective mental health care (/English/healthy-living/emotional

#### wellness/Pages/Mental-Health-Care-Whos-Who.aspx) provided to the central character, Hannah Baker, is both 

#### troubling and unrealistic. Statistics show that a large majority of the time, teens with suicidal thoughts and 

#### behaviors are in the grips of treatable mental illnesses, such as depression (/English/health

#### issues/conditions/emotional-problems/Pages/childhood-depression-what-parents-can-do-to-help.aspx). In the 

#### show, Hannah voices clear suicidal warning signs (/English/health-issues/conditions/emotional

#### problems/Pages/Help-Stop-Teen-Suicide.aspx) to her school guidance counselor. Yet, the counselor failed to 

#### connect her with other professionals and resources for help and told her simply to "move on." Critics say this 

#### sends a dangerous message that adults can't help. 

#### ● Play it safe. If your teen does watch the show, make an extra effort to watch him or her a little more closely 

#### afterwards—in a mindful, nurturing way. Know the signs of depression, such as withdrawing from friends or 

#### family, eating or sleeping less or more, or losing interest in activities.If you have a gun in your home 

#### (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/Handguns-in-the-Home.aspx), make sure it is stored unloaded and 

#### locked up separately from ammunition. Studies have found the risk of suicide is 4 to 10 times higher in homes 

#### with guns than in those without. And although Hannah Baker uses a different method to end her life, suicide by 

#### firearms (http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2016-1420) is now the second leading cause 

#### of death among teens 15-19. More than 80% of guns used in teen suicide attempts were kept in the home of the 

#### victim, a relative, or a friend. 

#### ● Don't assume your child isn't watching. "13 Reasons Why" is rated TV-MA (Mature Audience), appropriate 

#### for ages 17 and up, for its graphic violence, explicit sexual activity and crude language. But school officials and 

#### pediatricians say they're learning of children as young as elementary-school age who are binge watching the 

#### show—sometimes without parents knowing, because it can be streamed privately on their phones, tablets, and 

#### computers. Parents are often surprised to find out their child has watched the series. 

#### ○ As a parent, it is your job to counsel your children and teens about smart and safe media use. Dr. Breuner 

#### said she also asks her patients (and their parents) how much time they spend on screens and which shows 

#### they watch. 

#### ● Provide access to help. Give your child suggestions for whom he or she can turn to in times of need— 

#### including you, as well as other trusted adults. Your pediatrician can also help. The AAP recommends all children 

#### over age 12 be screened (/English/news/Pages/AAP-Publishes-Teen-Depression-Guideliness.aspx) for depression 

#### at their yearly checkups. For any immediate concerns about your child, call the National Suicide Prevention 

#### Lifeline at 1-800-TALK, or text START to 741741. 

### Even if your child hasn't watched... 

#### Parents should be aware that their children may hear friends talking about the show at school or on social media— 

#### even if they haven't seen it themselves. Regardless, Dr. Breuner said the series is "absolutely inappropriate" for 

#### children under age 13. 

#### If you haven't watched the show, look up episode summaries and be prepared talk with your child about the ways 

#### fictional shows don't always reflect reality. Use the show as an opportunity to talk with your child about the very real 

#### situations teens face—and how your child can come to you with anything he or she may face in the future. 

## Keep in Mind: 

#### It may feel uncomfortable to talk with your teen about some of the difficult issues raised in "13 Reasons Why," but 

#### talking about tough topics with teens is every bit as important as making sure a baby's bath water isn't too hot.

#### Remember to talk with your child's pediatrician if you have additional questions or concerns about your child's media 

#### use or mental health.
