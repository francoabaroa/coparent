# How to Help Teething Symptoms without Medications 

## Teething Toys 

## Find something for your little gnawer that’s cool to touch but tough to chew on—a wet washcloth chilled in 

## the freezer for 15 to 30 minutes, a frozen banana or berries if you’ve introduced solids, solid (not liquid

## filled) teething rings chilled in the fridge or freezer (take them out before they are rock hard), a frozen 

## bagel, your finger, or a “lovey”-type toy. 

## If Your Baby is Older than 6 to 9 Months: 

## Offer a slow-flow sippy cup of cool water to suck on and drink for comfort. Of note, plastic teething rings with liquids have been 

## given a bad name in the past few years due to recalls— potential bacteria growing in liquid and the possibility of a baby cutting 

## through the ring and into the liquid. 

## As many parents try to avoid plastics (due to presence of phthalates/BPA (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding

## nutrition/Pages/Baby-Bottles-And-Bisphenol-A-BPA.aspx)), use the washcloth method or a cotton sock rolled up tightly to 

## gnaw on. Silicone and latex chewy toys may be a safer bet. 

## Fingers 

## Let your baby gnaw on your fingers (if his or her teeth haven’t come through), or rub your baby’s gums with your clean fingers for 

## comfort. 

## Massage 

## If you’re breastfeeding (/english/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/default.aspx) and your baby isn’t interested in a 

## teething toy but more interested in chewing on your nipples (eeeeeek) or your arms, especially around the time of feeding, 

## massage your baby’s gums with your fingers dipped in cool water prior to starting a feeding. 

## Clean teething toys, washcloths, or socks after each use. And know that it’s absolutely fine to let your baby chew all day if he or 

## she enjoys it. Still, nothing about gnawing means pain.
