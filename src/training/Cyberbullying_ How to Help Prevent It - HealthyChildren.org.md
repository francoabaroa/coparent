# Cyberbullying: How to Help Prevent It 

## By: Megan Moreno, MD, MSEd, MPH, FAAP 

## With more kids than ever using cell phones and other 

## digital devices to text, post, and chat, cyberbullying is a 

## growing concern. But there are things parents can do to 

## keep online socializing healthy for their children. 

## What is cyberbullying? 

## Also called electronic or online bullying, cyberbullying 

## includes a range of harmful words and actions that take 

## place in the digital world. Some examples: 

## sending mean messages to someone 

## sharing embarrassing pictures of them 

## making up and spreading untrue stories about them 

## telling others to ignore someone or leave them out of activities 

## Cyberbullying can take place through text messaging, on social media sites, apps, e-mail, web forums or multi-player 

## online games. 

## How is cyberbullying different from bullying? 

## Once cyberbullying became an issue, experts weren’t sure if it was a whole new type of bullying, or traditional bullying 

## moving onto new platforms. A National Academics of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine report 

## (https://nam.edu/from-the-academies/) concluded that cyberbullying and bullying are more alike than different. 

## However, there are a few differences: 

## When & where. Face-to-face bullying usually takes place during the day, for example at school. But cyberbullying 

## can happen anyplace, any day of the week, at any time of day. 

## No signature needed. Although anonymous bullying is not common, either in person or online, cyberbullying 

## can happen without knowing who is sending the messages. 

## Passing it on. Mean or embarrassing posts on social media can spread quickly online and "go viral." This can 

## increase the hurt or embarrassment from a bullying experience. 

## Just like traditional bullying, kids can experience cyberbullying in different ways, and roles sometimes change within 

## a situation. They may be the target of bullying, bully others, or witness bullying online. 

## Is cyberbullying harmful? 

## For generations, bullying was considered a childhood "rite of passage." But research now shows how harmful bullying 

## can be – to children who are bullied and to those who bully others. Some negative effects of bullying include: 

## Academic struggles. Kids who are bullied may avoid going to school, have trouble concentrating in class, or 

## even drop out of school. 

## Physical and mental health. Bullying increases a child’s risk for depression (/English/health

## issues/conditions/emotional-problems/Pages/childhood-depression-what-parents-can-do-to-help.aspx), anxiety 

## (/English/health-issues/conditions/emotional-problems/Pages/Anxiety-Disorders.aspx), and sleep problems. 

## Studies show it may also put them at higher risk for substance use (/English/ages-stages/teen/substance

## What should I do if my child is bullied online? 

### It is hard for parents to know the best way to react if their child is bullied, online or offline. Here are a few tips: 

### The Takeaway. Don’t threaten to take away your child’s device or cut their time online. They may see this as 

### punishment and be less willing to tell you about bullying situations in the future. 

### Document. If there is online evidence, save a screenshot. This may be helpful if it becomes necessary to report 

### the event. 

### Support. Talk with your child about the experience. Studies show that having just one person listen and support 

### kids who have been bullied helps them better able to handle the situation in a healthy way. 

### Report. Most social media platforms have a process for reporting bad behavior. If a classmate is bullying, you can 

### report it to the school. If the bullying involves threats of physical harm, you can consider reporting to the police. 

### Find your support, too. A child’s bullying experience can also be stressful for a parent. Parents should consider 

### finding someone to talk to for support. 

### Find resources. Talk with your pediatrician about resources (http://www.safekids.com/bullying-cyberbullying

### resources/) for bullying. 

## How parents can prevent cyberbullying 

### Discuss digital citizenship. Talk with your children about being respectful online and how negative messages 

### can hurt others. And remember, you are a role model. So if you use social media yourself, be sure to set a good 

### example of positive online interactions. 

### Check in early & often. Ask your children about what kind of messages they are seeing, sending, and getting and 

### how they feel about them. Early experiences online are important and can set the tone and expectations your 

### child has going forward. 

### Make a plan. Use our family media use plan (/English/media/Pages/default.aspx) to set guidelines and rules that 

### are important to your family.
