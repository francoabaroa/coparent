# The Many Colors of Baby Poop 

## Long after adjusting to parenthood and your role as 

## principal poop watcher and wiper, you may still find 

## yourself fretting over changes in the color of your 

## baby's poop. 

## In reality, once your baby has pooped enough to get rid 

## of the tarry meconium, all the varying shades of yellow, 

## brown, and even green that may follow are considered 

## perfectly acceptable. Mustardy yellow is the color of 

## choice for most breastfed babies. For those who are 

## formula fed, it's yellow-tan with hints of green. 

## Being presented with a changing palette of colors in 

## your baby's diaper is not uncommon—particularly later on when your baby is introduced to solid foods and snotty 

## nose colds, both of which can add new shades and substance to the mix. 

## Black, white, and shades of red 

## A few colors of baby poop, should you see them, always warrant discussion with your baby's doctor. 

## Red 

## Seeing red can mean blood, especially in the newborn period when your baby isn't eating or drinking anything red 

## colored that could be mistaken for blood when it comes out the other end. 

## Blood should not signal you to panic immediately, but you should bring it to the attention of your pediatrician, who will 

## be able to help you sort out the cause. It is not uncommon for babies to swallow some blood during delivery that 

## presents itself shortly thereafter—in either the baby's spit-up or poop. 

## Additionally, in the case of blood-streaked spit-up, remember to consider whether your own sore, cracked nipples 

## might be the source. In any case, any amount of bloody poop should be evaluated because it can be a sign of a problem. 

## Black 

## Black-colored poop is worth paying attention to because blood typically turns from red to black over time in the 

## intestinal tract. Remember that this black color alert does not apply to your baby's first few meconium bowel 

## movements, which you can fully expect to be black and tarry looking without having to be concerned about blood. 

## White 

## White poop is quite rare but needs to be brought to the attention of a doctor as soon as possible. Pale poop that's 

## lacking in color can be caused by an underlying liver problem. The earlier it is assessed, the better, for peace of mind 

## or for important medical management.
