# Nursing Cramps 

## For a few days after delivery (/english/ages-stages/prenatal/delivery-beyond/Pages/default.aspx), 

## many women have cramping pain in the abdomen at the start of each feeding. This is because 

## breastfeeding (/english/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/default.aspx) stimulates the 

## release of hormones (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Benefits-of-Breastfeeding

## for-Mom.aspx) that help shrink the uterus back to its normal size. 

## How to Ease Nuring Cramps 

## You can ease nursing cramps by emptying your bladder before you start to breastfeed (a full 

## bladder will make the cramps more intense). You can relieve the nursing cramps by not lying flat on your back; 

## instead sit up “pretzel style” with your legs folded in front of you. This helps bring your uterus forward and relieves 

## the pressure. You can also take a prescribed pain medication (/English/ages

## stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Medications-and-Breastfeeding.aspx).
