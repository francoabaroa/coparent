# Cleaning Baby Clothes 

## Washability is definitely something to consider. Be sure to look at the labels not only for size, 

## flame-resistance, or snug-fitting information but also for washing instructions. Unless you relish 

## the thought of hand-washing a lot of baby clothes and frequently replacing those that don’t hold 

## up well, we suggest you give some serious thought to the durability and washability of the baby 

## clothes you buy—especially your baby’s everyday outfits, Onesies, and sleepers. 

## Washing. Because newborns tend to have sensitive skin (and because you don’t know who 

## has handled the clothing and with what before it made its way into your possession), it’s 

## generally a good idea to wash all clothes prior to using them. An exception might be 

## outerwear such as coats and jackets that don’t have much contact with the skin (and tend not to wash and dry 

## easily). As a helpful hint, consider putting small items such as socks in a mesh bag for washing and drying and 

## remember to fasten any Velcro tabs (such as on bibs) before tossing them into the fray to avoid snagging other 

## clothes. 

## Detergents. It is a common recommendation that baby clothes should be washed separately, using special 

## “baby” detergents that supposedly leave fewer residues and are therefore less likely to cause skin irritation. In 

## reality, we’ve found that many if not most parents simply toss their baby’s clothes in with the rest of the family’s 

## laundry without causing any problems. That said, it is worth paying attention to the fact that detergents in 

## general don’t strip away the flame-retardant properties of sleepwear, but soap flakes can. Given that information, 

## you can choose your detergent as we do—buy one that smells good and gets the dirt out, and only feel compelled 

## to invest in a milder “baby” detergent (or hypoallergenic/fragrance-free “adult” detergent) if your baby develops 

## any signs of skin irritation. 

## Stain removal. The best approach to managing stains made by breast milk, formula, spit-up, or poop is to try 

## wiping or rinsing off the offending substance as much as you can while it’s still relatively fresh. We realize that 

## this may be easier said than done—especially if you find yourself in the middle of a diaper change or feeding with 

## a clothing stain that is settling itself in for the long haul—but if you can remove even some of it with a baby wipe 

## or soak the clothes in some water and detergent, you’ll be glad you did. We also suggest stocking your laundry 

## room with a good stain remover and designating a place for soaking stained or soiled clothing.
