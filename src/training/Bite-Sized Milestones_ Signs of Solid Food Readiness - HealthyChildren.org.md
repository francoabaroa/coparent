# Bite-Sized Milestones: Signs of Solid Food Readiness 

## It’s not coincidental that many of the physical skills necessary to 

## embark on solid food (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding

## nutrition/Pages/Starting-Solid-Foods.aspx)feeding are reached at 

## right about the same time that babies can rise to the occasion. And 

## just when breast milk (/English/ages

## stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/default.aspx)or formula 

## (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Amount-and

## Schedule-of-Formula-Feedings.aspx) consumption often isn’t 

## enough to tide them over, their digestive systems become ready to 

## take on the challenge of solid foods. When your baby learns to 

## master the following mealtime milestones, she is likely to be ready, 

## willing, and able to start out on her feeding adventure. 

## Hold Her Head Up High. Although some babies are able to lift their heads in a show of strength from the day 

## they are born, it’s usually not until 3 or 4 months of age that the ability to hold one’s head up consistently higher 

## and for longer periods sets in. 

## Sitting Pretty. Babies typically start sitting—albeit initially with a fair bit of propping—at about 6 months of age. 

## Fortunately, several modern-day high chairs (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/High-Chair-Safety

## Tips.aspx)and feeding chairs come with convenient recline features that offer additional support for those not 

## quite ready to sit fully upright on their own. 

## Big Enough to Take It. As a rough rule of thumb, babies are big enough to tackle solid foods right around the 

## time when they double their birth weight and reach a minimum of about 13 pounds. 

## Open Wide. As babies become more aware of the world around them, they also tend to become more interested 

## in food—often watching food intently and opening their mouths in eager anticipation when they see some 

## headed their way. 

## When your baby starts eating solid foods, be sure to introduce a variety of foods early to avoid picky eating later on.
