# Baby-Wearing 

## "Baby-wearing" is recommended not just as a response 

## to crying (/english/ages-stages/baby/crying

## colic/Pages/default.aspx), but to prevent crying and 

## promote parent-infant attachment and the baby’s 

## development. 

## How to "Baby-Wear" 

## You could place your baby in a front pouch and "wear" 

## her around the house while you cook, clean, or even pay 

## bills, for example. If you’re doing active chores, be sure 

## to keep safety in mind. This technique may make your 

## baby cry less and enhance her learning. 

## Note: Check with your baby’s care provider before using a baby pack or pouch—sometimes NICU graduates

## Too Much Holding? 

## Some parents worry about spoiling their infant with too much holding. Don’t worry. Experts agree that holding a baby 

## in the early months meets the infant’s basic need to feel safe. In fact, babies who are picked up as soon as they begin to 

## cry tend to cry less often and for shorter periods than do babies whose parents don’t respond quickly. 

## This doesn’t mean you have to pick your baby up with every peep you hear. As your baby grows, let her learn about 

## and explore personal ways to self-comfort. She will discover that sucking her fist, holding her blanket, or clasping her 

## hands together will help her feel better for a few moments.
