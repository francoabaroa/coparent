# Virtual Violence: How Does it Affect Children? 

## By: David L. Hill, MD, FAAP 

## Since the earliest motion pictures, adults have worried 

## about how children would respond to violent imagery. 

## Now that mobile screens offer kids unlimited access to 

## violent images and videos, we have even more to worry 

## about. 

## As a parent or caregiver, you may feel overwhelmed by 

## the thought of how virtual violence can affect your 

## child. But there are practical steps you can take to 

## protect kids of all ages, helping them place what they 

## see and hear in a healthier context. 

## Understanding what virtual violence means in your child's world 

## Virtual violence is any act of aggression your child might absorb through TV, movies, video games, social media and 

## other digital channels. It includes the simulated violence in blockbuster films and amateur videos and the animated 

## violence embedded in cartoons and interactive games. News reports (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/Talking-To

## Children-About-Tragedies-and-Other-News-Events.aspx) of real-life tragedies also deliver an endless loop of virtual 

## violence that young people see and hear 24/7. 

## Keep in mind that virtual violence isn't limited to instances of physical harm. Aggressive, threatening, racist or hateful 

## statements can be just as damaging to children who witness them. 

## What children see (or play) influences how they behave 

## Decades of research (https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/138/2/e20161298/52469/Virtual-Violence? 

## autologincheck=redirected?nfToken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000) link virtual violence to 

## aggressive thoughts, feelings and actions in children. And even though we're still learning about the effects of violent 

## content video games (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/Video-Games-Set-Your-Own-Ratings-System.aspx) and social 

## media (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/social-media-and-your-childs-mental-health-what-research-says.aspx), 

## experts agree that kids are deeply influenced by brutality wherever they experience it. 

## Witnessing violent acts—whether real or simulated—may give kids the sense that aggression is normal and 

## acceptable. This may lead them to act out what they see and hear, especially if they witness violence at home 

## (/English/healthy-living/emotional-wellness/Pages/stress-and-violence-at-home-during-challenging-times.aspx) or 

## in their communities. Newer studies show that exposure to virtual violence can trigger mental health struggles, 

## including depression (/English/health-issues/conditions/emotional-problems/Pages/childhood-depression-what

## parents-can-do-to-help.aspx) and anxiety (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/Pages/help-your-child-manage

## fears-and-anxieties.aspx). 

## It's worrisome enough to think of the short-term effects on our children. But long-term studies also show that 

## exposure to virtual violence in childhood leads to aggressive behavior in adulthood, even when people stop 

## consuming violent media in later years. 

## 5 practical steps to protect children & teens from the effects of virtual 

## violence 

## You can't shield your child from all forms of virtual violence. But these 5 steps can help minimize the harm that 

## violent content can do to your child's health, now and in the future. 


#### 1. Limit what very young children watch and play. If you have children under age 6, try to exclude violent 

#### content from their "media diet." Kids this young cannot distinguish fantasy from reality. To them, even violence 

#### that seems cartoonish to use seems real. 

#### 2. Use parental controls and media ratings. A variety of technologies promise to offer you control over your 

#### children's viewing and playing habits, and they can certainly be helpful if you learn how to use them. But no 

#### program can replace your personal involvement in your children's choices. Young children should always ask 

#### permission before they watch or play video games on any device. Learn more about TV content ratings 

#### (http://www.tvguidelines.org/resources/TV_Parental_guidelines_Brochure.pdf) and movie ratings 

#### (https://www.filmratings.com/Tips) that can help you choose wisely for your family. The Entertainment Software 

#### Rating Board (ESRB (https://www.esrb.org/)) publishes helpful ratings for games and apps, and Common Sense 

#### Media (https://www.commonsensemedia.org/) provides a wealth of ratings, tips and insights. 

#### 3. Watch or play with your kids. Your attention has tremendous power. Explain that you're interested in the 

#### things they like to watch and play. Sit down with them for a while to gauge the level of virtual violence in their 

#### favorite shows, movies, games or apps. This gives you a base of knowledge that can help you set realistic limits 

#### and expectations later on. 

#### 4. Discuss what you see. When enjoying entertainment with your child, take time to talk with them about it. Ask 

#### how especially violent or aggressive scenes made them feel. Show interest in their impressions and opinions 

#### without arguing with them. You can share your own views without suggesting that any single opinion is 100% 

#### right or wrong. For example, you might say, "I can understand why that character was angry. But I hate to see 

#### people get violent instead of finding other ways to settle their differences." 

#### These conversations compare what your child is seeing with your family values (/English/healthy

#### living/emotional-wellness/Building-Resilience/Pages/Books-to-Build-Character-Teach-Important-Values.aspx) 

#### such as respect, tolerance, kindness (/English/healthy-living/emotional-wellness/Building

#### Resilience/Pages/Kindness-Can-Make-a-Big-Difference.aspx) and mutual understanding. They also give you the 

#### chance to call out instances where violence is rewarded or glamorized and offer a differing viewpoint. 

#### 5. Create a family media plan (/english/fmp/pages/mediaplan.aspx). The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 

#### offers an easy-to-use tool to help parents and caregivers manage family media usage. You'll find a list of media 

#### priorities to choose from, practical tips to assure success, and the ability to print and share your plan with 

#### caregivers, family and friends. You can even save your plan and edit it as your family's needs change over time.

## Seeing your child's risks with clear eyes 

#### Though we may hear what all this research is trying to tell us, we might also want to believe we don't have to worry 

#### about our own kids. Just as 90% of all U.S. adults see themselves as better-than-average drivers, millions of us assume 

#### that virtual violence is something other parents have to worry about. 

#### I'm a parent, too, and I've fallen into this trap before. I hate to think that my sweet son might be harmed by the violent 

#### video games he enjoys playing. But I've seen how his behavior changes after he spends hours absorbed in them. And 

#### as a pediatrician, I'm equally concerned about the violence kids see in movies, videos, social media and news reports, 

#### especially school shootings and other tragedies where children are hurt or killed.

## Your pediatrician is ready to support you 

#### No single violent movie or video game will make your child violent – and failing to screen out every instance of virtual 

#### violence does NOT make you a bad parent. What matters is the amount and intensity of virtual violence your child 

#### absorbs over time. You can protect your child's health by monitoring what they watch and play and putting common

#### sense rules in place, based on your child's age, temperament and unique needs. 

#### If you're worried about virtual violence, don't hesitate to ask your pediatrician for guidance. Media use is one of many 

#### health-related subjects your child's doctor discusses with parents often. They can offer practical tips that are tailored 

#### to your family situation and, whenever needed, refer you to mental health providers who can address specific 

#### concerns or symptoms you might be seeing in your child.
