# Baby Sunburn Prevention 

## Why is a baby at special risk from sunburn? 

## A baby’s skin (/English/ages-stages/baby/bathing-skin-care/Pages/Baby-Skin-Basics.aspx) is 

## more delicate and thinner than an adult’s and burns and irritates more easily. Even dark-skinned 

## babies may be sunburned (/English/safety-prevention/at-play/Pages/Sunburn-Treatment-And

## Prevention.aspx). Babies cannot tell you if they are too hot or beginning to burn and cannot get 

## out of the sun without an adult’s help. Babies also need an adult to dress them properly and to 

## apply sunscreen (/English/safety-prevention/at-play/Pages/Sunburn-Treatment-And

## Prevention.aspx). 

## Prevention Tips 

## Learn how to stop sunburn before it happens and keep your baby happy, safe, and smiling: 

## Babies younger than 6 months should be kept out of direct and indirect sunlight because of the risk of heat 

## stroke. Particularly, avoid having a baby out between 10 a.m and 2 p.m. when the sun’s rays are strongest. 

## Keep babies in the shade as much as possible. For example, they should be moved under a tree, beach umbrella, 

## or stroller canopy. However, it is important to note that although on reflective surfaces, an umbrella or canopy 

## may reduce UVR exposure by only 50%. 

## Dress babies in lightweight cotton clothing with long sleeves and long pants and a sun hat with a wide brim. 

## Sunscreen may be applied to babies younger than 6 months to small areas of skin uncovered by clothing and 

## hats. Remember to cover all exposed areas of a baby's skin, including the face, back of the hands, back of the neck, 

## tips of the ears, and tops of the feet. 

## Apply the protection 15 to 30 minutes before going out. Keep in mind that no sunscreens are truly waterproof, 

## and thus they need to be reapplied every one and a half to two hours, particularly if a baby goes into the water. 

## Consult the instructions on the bottle.
