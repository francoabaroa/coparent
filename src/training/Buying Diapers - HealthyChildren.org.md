# Buying Diapers 

## By: Laura A. Jana, MD, FAAP and Jennifer Shu, MD, FAAP 

## At an average of nearly 30 cents a diaper for brand

## name disposables and about 3,000 diapers, you can 

## expect to spend around $1,000 during your first year of 

## diaperingâ€”and that's not even factoring in wipes, 

## diaper creams, and all the other diapering 

## paraphernalia. With those figures in mind, we thought 

## it would be useful to point out several potential ways 

## you can save yourselfsome money in the diapering 

## department. 

## Start small. Start out by buying diapers in smaller 

## quantities. You'll want to make sure you've found a good match, but also, keep in mind that your newborn will be 

## growing very quickly in the months to come. If at first you happen to settle on a more expensive brand, 

## remember that as your baby gets older (ie, potentially has less sensitive skin, less leaky poop, and pees less 

## frequently), you may want to experiment with less expensive brands. 

## Divide and conquer. Calculate your cost per diaper. This may sound obvious, but by simply dividing the cost of a 

## pack of diapers by the number of diapers in the pack, you can figure out whether what you're getting is really a 

## good deal or is just being advertised as one. Quite often, the retail (and virtual) stores list this price-per-diaper 

## cost for you, if you just remember to look for it. If and when you do, you'll find that mega-jumbo packs aren't 

## always the best bargain, and one store's sale price doesn't always beat the everyday price at another. 

## Cut coupons. If you're the coupon type, it won't take much convincing for you to find a quick search for diaper 

## coupons well worth your while. If you're not the coupon type, you might want to give it a try anyway. At the rate 

## you'll be using diapers, there's really not a good reason to pass up $1, $2, or even $5 off a pack. While you're at it, 

## consider using your coupons at stores that double manufacturers' coupons. 

## Think big. When you find a sale or have coupons, buy extra diapers in advance to spare yourself a middle of the 

## night run to the grocery store because you've used your last one. If you're going to take advantage and really 

## stock up, you might just want to consider having your reserve supply be a size up from the one your baby's 

## currently wearing. That way, you don't wind up having a stockpile of leftover, too-small diapers that don't fit as 

## your baby outgrows them faster than you can use them. 

## Join the club. Take note of frequent buyers' clubs. You know you're going to be in the market for diapers for a 

## long time to come, and by simply collecting proofs of purchase (or "diaper points"), many companies reward you 

## with baby clothes, toys, music, and other products. Similarly, some grocery and drugstore chains now tally up 

## dollars spent on baby items and offer rebates or coupons each time you reach a certain total (for example, a $10 

## store coupon every time you spend $100 on baby items at that store). 

## DIAPER(LESS) TRIVIA 

## Did you know that in certain Asian and African cultures, babies are not put into diapers? When a baby awakens or 

## the parent notices certain cues, the parent places the baby over a bush or another designated area to pee or poop. 

## Although you may want to adapt this technique when it comes time to potty train, based on social norms in 

## America, we don't recommend you try this with your newborn at home!

#### Consider your options. Consider using cloth diapers and washing them yourself. By some estimates, using a 

#### diaper service instead of paying for disposable diapers only lets you break even. By others, washing cloth diapers 

#### yourself has the potential to cut your diapering costs by as much as half.
