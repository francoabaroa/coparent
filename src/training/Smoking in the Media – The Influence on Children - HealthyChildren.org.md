# Smoking in the Media – The Influence on Children 

## Many young people know smoking (/English/health

## issues/conditions/tobacco/Pages/Teens-and-Smoking.aspx) is not 

## healthy but still think it's cool. A big reason for this is the media. 

## Tobacco and e-cigarette companies spend billions of dollars every 

## year promoting their products at stores, in magazines, and online. 

## Most ads show smokers as healthy, energetic, sexy, and successful. 

## There are also many TV, video game, and and movie scenes 

## (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/Smoking-in-the-Movies.aspx) 

## showing people smoking. These scenes promote the idea that lots 

## of people smoke and rarely show the bad consequences of smoking 

## like trouble breathing, cancer, complications with other diseases, or 

## even death. 

## Things Parents can do to Help Children Understand the Influence of 

## the Media: 

## Talk about ads with your children. Help them to understand the real messages in these ads. 

## Teach your children to be wary consumers and not to believe everything they see and hear on TV. 

## Make sure the TV shows, video games, and movies your children watch do not show smoking as cool or 

## glamorous. 

## Don't let your children wear clothes or hats that promote tobacco and e-cigarette companies or their products. 

## Do not bring any promotional products (like beach towels, coffee mugs, pens, or keychains) into the home that 

## have logos or names of tobacco or e-cigarette companies on them. 

## Talk with your children's school about starting a media education program.
