# Quirky Kids: Understanding & Supporting a Child with 

# Developmental Differences 

## By: Perri Klass, MD, FAAP & Eileen Costello, MD, FAAP 

## You're worried about a child you love. There's 

## something different, something off, something 

## eccentric, something quirky. You want to understand 

## what's going on, and most of all, you want to help. 

## Your job as a parent is to help your child grow and 

## develop and learn and thrive. To do that job properly, 

## you have to understand your child as an individual, 

## quirks and all. 

## Doing things differently 

## The world is full of quirky kids. They live with us in our houses, but they live in slightly different zones, seeing the 

## world around them through idiosyncratic lenses, walking just a little out of step, marching and even dancing to the 

## beat of different drummers. 

## The kids we are calling “quirky" are the ones who do things differently. Maybe you've noticed developmental 

## variations—a child who doesn't talk (/English/tips-tools/ask-the-pediatrician/Pages/one-year-old--Should-she-be

## talking-by-now.aspx) on time or, perhaps alternatively, talks constantly but can't get a point across. Or maybe there's 

## something about your child's temperament that makes daily life a challenge: a rigid need for absolute routine, a 

## propensity for nuclear tantrums. Or perhaps you're uncomfortably aware of social difficulties because your toddler is 

## always alone while the rest of the playgroup lives up to its name. 

## These are the differences—skewed development, temperamental extremes, social complications—that define the 

## group of quirky kids. As pediatricians and mothers, we are in contact with kids every day, and we have become 

## interested in the quirky kids among us. 

## Through a parent's eyes 

## Here are the voices of a few different parents telling us about their very different children: 

## Aidan : As Aidan got older, I noticed more and more his inability to interact with other kids and his lack of interest in 

## activities. I tried to take a music class with him. He had no interest whatsoever. He would not participate. He was 

## more interested in the lights in the room, the stuff on the bulletin board, the numbers and letters. 

## John : The weekend I decided our son, John, had autism—he was 3—we were on Cape Cod, and it was overwhelming 

## for him. He put his arms around this little tiny tree and shook back and forth the entire weekend. He was wearing a 

## sleeper with feet and sneakers, he was wearing a watch, and he was hanging on to this tree. And I said to my husband, 

## “I think he's autistic—this is so far off the curve." 

## Caitlin : Caitlin is good at math, but she can get completely stuck if there is a typo in the word problem. She's 

## idiosyncratic. She cannot stand to estimate; she must have a precise answer. If the graph paper doesn't have enough 

## lines, she gets stuck. 

## Trevor : Trevor is an anxious child who now, at the age of 9, very much wants to be like other kids and wants the 

## other kids to like him. He's an avid baseball fan and player, and that has helped him out in the social area, but he still 

## has some autistic-type behaviors, like running in circles when he is excited. He writes or draws in the air when he is 

## bored or feels uncomfortable. 


## Quirky kids among us 

### Growing up with or without a diagnosis 

##### Forty or 50 years ago, these kids would have been thought of as odd or eccentric. But they would not have undergone 

##### medical or psychiatric assessments, and they would not have been given diagnoses. Nowadays, you may find that 

##### helping your quirky child grow up involves coping with a formal diagnosis or often multiple diagnoses or diagnoses 

##### that shift and change as the child grows. 

##### We're not talking about children diagnosed with severe developmental delay and intellectual disability or major 

##### mental illness. They are outside the scope of what we define here as “quirky," and there is a great deal of specific 

##### expertise out there to help parents get them the help and support they need. We are talking about a group of children 

##### who inhabit a grayer zone, a zone of characteristics also found in typically developing children, a zone of overlapping 

##### diagnoses and evolving terminology. 

### Finding their own path 

##### Some of these children never need any special services or therapies. They follow their own eccentric paths through 

##### school and through life, accomplishing all kinds of wonderful and unusual things. But others struggle, and nowadays, 

##### that usually means medical attention. 

##### You may find, for example, that concerns will be raised about whether your child has autism spectrum disorder 

##### (/English/health-issues/conditions/Autism/Pages/default.aspx), nonverbal learning disability, or social (pragmatic) 

##### communication disorder. Depending on their strengths and weaknesses, as well as on who does the diagnosing, 

##### children may also be diagnosed with sensory processing disorder, social phobia, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity 

##### disorder (/English/health-issues/conditions/adhd/Pages/default.aspx). It's important to note that these are all 

##### relatively recent diagnostic categories that may be used to describe children who, when we were young, might have 

##### just been called “eccentric"—or maybe harsher schoolyard names. 

## Challenging yet often charming 

#### We're calling them quirky kids. We prefer this term for a reason. It's not pejorative. In fact, it's sometimes a 

##### compliment. But it does suggest the unusual features—challenging yet often charming—shared by an increasing 

##### number of children in our society. 

##### We don't mean to minimize the seriousness of your concerns or the pain that comes with worrying about a child. But 

##### it's also true that everyone gets only one childhood, one family, one set of parents. Look for ways to enjoy and 

##### appreciate the child you have, even as you look for answers and help.
