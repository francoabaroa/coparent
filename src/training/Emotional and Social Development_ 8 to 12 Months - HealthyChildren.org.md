# Emotional and Social Development: 8 to 12 Months 

## During these months, your child sometimes may seem like two separate babies. First there’s the 

## one who’s open, affectionate, and outgoing with you. But then there’s another who’s anxious, 

## clinging, and easily frightened around unfamiliar people or objects. Some people may tell you 

## that your child is fearful or shy because you’re “spoiling” her, but don’t believe it. Her widely 

## diverse behavior patterns aren’t caused by you or your parenting style; they occur because she’s 

## now, for the first time, able to tell the difference between familiar and unfamiliar situations. If 

## anything, the predictable anxieties of this period are evidence of her healthy relationship with 

## you. 

## Anxiety around strangers is usually one of the first emotional milestones your baby will reach. You may think 

## something is wrong when this child of yours who, at the age of three months, interacted calmly with people she didn’t 

## know is now beginning to tense up when strangers come too close. This is normal for this age, and you need not worry. 

## Even relatives and frequent babysitters (/English/family-life/work-play/Pages/default.aspx) with whom your baby was 

## once comfortable may prompt her to hide or cry now, especially if they approach her hastily. 

## At about the same time, she’ll become much more “clutchy” about leaving you. This is the start of separation anxiety 

## (/English/ages-stages/toddler/Pages/Soothing-Your-Childs-Separation-Anxiety.aspx). Just as she’s starting to realize 

## that each object is unique and permanent, she’ll also discover that there’s only one of you. When you’re out of her 

## sight, she’ll know you’re somewhere, but not with her, and this will cause her great distress. She’ll have so little sense 

## of time that she won’t know when—or even whether—you’ll be coming back. Once she gets a little older, her memory 

## of past experiences with you will comfort her when you’re gone, and she’ll be able to anticipate a reunion. But for now 

## she’s only aware of the present, so every time you leave her sight—even to go to the next room—she’ll fuss and cry. 

## When you leave her with someone else, she may scream as though her heart will break. At bedtime, she’ll refuse to 

## leave you to go to sleep, and then she may wake up searching for you in the middle of the night. 

## How long should you expect this separation anxiety to last? It usually peaks between ten and eighteen months and 

## then fades during the last half of the second year. In some ways, this phase of your child’s emotional development will 

## be especially tender for both of you, while in others, it will be painful. After all, her desire to be with you is a sign of her 

## attachment to her first and greatest love—namely you. The intensity of her feeling as she hurtles into your arms is 

## irresistible, especially when you realize that no one—including your child herself—will ever again think you are quite 

## as perfect as she does at this age. On the other hand, you may feel suffocated by her constant clinging, while 

## experiencing guilt whenever you leave her crying for you. Fortunately, this emotional roller coaster eventually will 

## subside along with her separation anxiety. But in the meantime, try to downplay your leave-taking as much as possible. 

## Here are some suggestions that may help. 

## 1. Your baby is more susceptible to separation anxiety when she’s tired, hungry, or sick. If you know you’re going to 

## go out, schedule your departure so that it occurs after she’s napped and eaten. And try to stay with her as much 

## as possible when she’s sick. 

## 2. Don’t make a fuss over your leaving. Instead, have the person staying with her create a distraction (a new toy, a 

## visit to the mirror, a bath). Then say goodbye and slip away quickly. 

## 3. Remember that her tears will subside within minutes of your departure. Her outbursts are for your benefit, to 

## persuade you to stay. With you out of sight, she’ll soon turn her attention to the person staying with her. 

## 4. Help her learn to cope with separation through short practice sessions at home. Separation will be easier on her 

## when she initiates it, so when she crawls to another room (one that’s babyproofed), don’t follow her right away; 

## wait for one or two minutes. When you have to go to another room for a few seconds, tell her where you’re going 

## and that you’ll return. If she fusses, call to her instead of running back. Gradually she’ll learn that nothing 

## terrible happens when you’re gone and, just as important, that you always come back when you say you will. 

## 5. If you take your child to a sitter’s home or a child care center, don’t just drop her off and leave. Spend a few extra 

## minutes playing with her in this new environment. When you do leave, reassure her that you’ll be back later. 

## If your child has a strong, healthy attachment to you, her separation anxiety probably will occur earlier than in other 

## babies, and she’ll pass through it more quickly. Instead of resenting her possessiveness during these months, maintain 

## as much warmth and good humor as you can. Through your actions, you’re showing her how to express and return

## love. This is the emotional base she’ll rely on in years to come. 

## From the beginning, you’ve considered your baby to be a unique person with specific character traits and preferences. 

## She, however, has had only a dim notion of herself as a person separate from you. Now her sense of identity is coming 

## into bloom. As she develops a growing sense of herself as an individual, she’ll also become increasingly conscious of 

## you as a separate person. 

## One of the clearest signs of her own self-awareness is the way your baby watches herself in the mirror at this age. Up 

## to about eight months, she treated the mirror as just another fascinating object. Perhaps, she thought, the reflection 

## was another baby, or maybe it was a magical surface of lights and shadows. But now her responses will change, 

## indicating she understands that one of the images belongs to her. While watching the mirror, for example, she may 

## touch a smudge on her own nose or pull on a stray lock of her hair. You can reinforce her sense of identity by playing 

## mirror games. When you’re looking in the mirror together, touch different body parts: “This is Jenny’s nose. This is 

## Mommy’s nose.” Or move in and out of the mirror, playing peekaboo with the reflections. Or make faces and verbally 

## label the emotions you are conveying. 

## As the months pass and your child’s self-concept becomes more secure, she’ll have less trouble meeting strangers 

## and separating from you. She’ll also become more assertive. Before, you could count on her to be relatively compliant 

## as long as she was comfortable. But now, more often than not, she’ll want things her own particular way. For instance, 

## don’t be surprised if she turns up her nose at certain foods or objects when you place them in front of her. Also, as she 

## becomes more mobile, you’ll find yourself frequently saying “no,” to warn her away from things she shouldn’t touch. 

## But even after she understands the word, she may touch anyway. Just wait—this is only a forerunner of power 

## struggles to come. 

## Your baby also may become afraid of objects and situations that she used to take in stride. At this age, fears of the dark, 

## thunder, and loud appliances such as vacuum cleaners are common. Later you’ll be able to subdue these fears by 

## talking about them, but for now, the only solution is to eliminate the source of the fears as much as possible: Put a 

## night-light in her room, or vacuum when she’s not around. And when you can’t shield her from something that 

## frightens her, try to anticipate her reaction and be close by so she can turn to you. Comfort her, but stay calm so she 

## understands that you are not afraid. If you reassure her every time she hears a clap of thunder or the roar of a jet 

## overhead, her fear gradually will subside until all she has to do is look at you to feel safe.
