# Consider Your Child’s Age Before Trying Tooth Whitening 

# Products 

## After the tooth fairy has made a few visits to your home, you might 

## notice that your child's pearly smile doesn't seem as white now that 

## she has a few more adult teeth. This is because the top layer 

## (enamel) of baby teeth is thinner and whiter than the enamel of 

## adult teeth. 

## Over-the-counter tooth whitening products such as whitening 

## strips, trays and gels have exploded in popularity in recent 

## years. But should children use them? 

## Pediatric dentists (/English/family-life/health

## management/pediatric-specialists/Pages/What-is-a-Pediatric

## Dentist.aspx) usually do not suggest bleaching until all baby teeth 

## have fallen out. If using at-home bleaching products, parents should read the product label for recommended ages 

## and instructions. 

## Dark teeth can be caused by colas, dark juices, popsicles, coffee and other foods. A single dark tooth could be the result 

## of an injury to the tooth, tooth decay or cavities. 

## Children should visit a dentist for a routine checkup and cleaning (/English/healthy-living/oral-health/Pages/Why

## Regular-Dental-Visits-Are-Important.aspx) every six months, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. 

## There, they can talk about whitening treatments. 

## "I tell parents to hold off decisions about bleaching (until) after age 14, because all the baby teeth are gone by then and 

## the adult teeth are fully erupted," said Martha Ann Keels, D.D.S., Ph.D. 

## She suggests starting with an at-home kit with a low amount of bleach. "It is important to pay attention to the side 

## effects and stop bleaching if the teeth start to be sensitive or the gums become irritated," she said. 

## A dentist should examine an injured tooth that has turned dark or teeth with white spots and decide if in-office 

## bleaching would work better than at-home products, she said. 

## Before your child uses whitening products to improve how her teeth look, remember that the tooth color difference 

## won't be as noticeable when all her adult teeth come in. 

## "Once all the baby teeth are out, then the contrast with white color is gone and the permanent teeth do not look so 

## yellow," said Dr. Keels. "I try to encourage accepting natural beauty over bleaching."
