# Jaundice in Newborns: Parent FAQs 

## Jaundice (/English/tips-tools/symptom

## checker/Pages/symptomviewer.aspx? 

## symptom=Jaundiced+Newborn) is the yellow color seen 

## in the skin of many newborns. It happens when a 

## chemical called bilirubin builds up in the baby's blood. 

## Read on for answers to some common questions 

## parents have about this condition and how its treated. 

## Why is jaundice common in 

## newborns? 

## Everyone's blood contains bilirubin, which comes from 

## red blood cells and is removed by the liver. Before birth, the mother's liver does this for the baby. Most babies develop 

## jaundice in the first few days after birth because it takes a few days for the baby's liver to get better at removing 

## bilirubin. 

## How can I tell if my baby has jaundice? 

## The skin of a baby with jaundice usually appears yellow. The best way to see jaundice is in white light, such as daylight 

## or under fluorescent lights. Jaundice usually appears first in the face and then moves to the chest, abdomen, arms and 

## legs as the bilirubin level increases. The whites of the eyes may also be yellow. Jaundice may be harder to see in babies 

## with darker skin color. 

## Can jaundice hurt my newborn? 

## Most babies have mild jaundice that is harmless. But in rare cases, the bilirubin level can get very high and might 

## cause brain damage. This is why testing bilirubin levels as recommended is important. 

## Does breastfeeding affect jaundice? 

## Breast milk (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Where-We-Stand-Breastfeeding.aspx) (human milk) is 

## the ideal food for your baby. Jaundice is more common in babies who are breastfed than babies who are formula-fed. 

## This happens more often in newborns who are not getting enough breast milk because their mothers are not 

## producing enough milk (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/low-breast-milk-supply.aspx) (especially if 

## the milk comes in late) or if breastfeeding is not going well, such as babies not latching on properly. 

## For the first 24 hours after birth, normal breastfed newborns receive only about 1 teaspoon of milk with each feeding. 

## The amount (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/How-to-Tell-if-Baby-is-Getting-Enough-Milk.aspx) of 

## breast milk provided increases with each day. If you are breastfeeding, you should breastfeed your baby at least 8 to 12 

## times a day for the first few days. This will help you produce enough milk and will help keep the baby's bilirubin level 

## down. If you are having trouble breastfeeding, ask your baby's doctor or nurse or a lactation specialist for help. 

## When should my baby's bilirubin level be measured? 

## Any baby that has jaundice in the first 24 hours after birth should have the bilirubin level measured right away. All 

## babies should have at least one bilirubin measurement with skin or blood test before discharge from the hospital. 

## Whether a baby needs additional bilirubin levels measured depends on the baby's age, the level of bilirubin, and 

## whether the baby has other things that make jaundice more likely. 

## It is important for your baby to get checked soon after leaving the hospital. In most cases, babies discharged before 48 

## hours should be seen within 2 days by a healthcare provider. Ask your baby's healthcare provider about their bilirubin 

## level and schedule a follow-up appointment. 


## Why do some babies need an earlier follow-up visit after leaving the 

## hospital? 

#### Some babies have a greater risk for high levels of bilirubin and may need to be seen sooner after discharge from the 

#### hospital. Ask your doctor about an early follow-up visit (/English/ages-stages/Your-Childs-Checkups/Pages/Your

#### Checkup-Checklist-Newborn-Visit-2-to-5-days-old.aspx) if your baby has any of the following symptoms: 

#### A high bilirubin level before leaving the hospital 

#### Early birth (more than 2 weeks before the due date) 

#### Jaundice in the first 24 hours after birth 

#### Breastfeeding that is not yet going well 

#### Bleeding under the scalp or a lot of bruising related to labor and delivery 

#### A parent, brother or sister who had a high bilirubin level and received light therapy 

#### Also, let your baby's doctor know if you eat fava beans (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532498/) (broad 

#### beans) or use any of the following products: mothballs, antibiotics, henna, or herbal remedies. Eating fava beans and 

#### using these products should be avoided because in rare cases this can cause severe jaundice. 

## When should I call my baby's doctor? 

#### Call your baby's doctor if you notice these symptoms: 

#### Your baby's skin turns more yellow. 

#### Your baby's abdomen, arms, or legs are yellow. 

#### The whites of your baby's eyes are yellow. 

#### Your baby is hard to wake, fussy, or not nursing or taking formula well. 

## How is jaundice in babies treated? 

#### Treatment can prevent the potentially harmful effects of jaundice. Most jaundice requires no treatment. When 

#### treatment is needed, babies are placed undressed under special lights (phototherapy). Phototherapy helps lower the 

#### bilirubin level. This is typically done in the hospital, but depending on your baby's bilirubin level, age, and other things, 

#### it can sometimes be done at home. In some babies, supplementing breast milk with formula can help lower the 

#### bilirubin level. 

#### Very high bilirubin levels are a medical emergency that might require admission to the intensive care unit and other 

#### treatment, including a special type of blood transfusion that can rapidly decrease the bilirubin level. 

### Note: Putting your baby into sunlight is not a safe way to treat jaundice. 

## When does infant jaundice go away? 

#### In breastfed babies, it is common for jaundice to last 1 month or occasionally longer. In formula-fed babies, most 

#### jaundice goes away by 2 weeks. Let your baby's doctor know if your baby has jaundice for more than 2 weeks if your 

#### baby is formula fed or longer than 4 weeks if your baby is primarily breastfed.
