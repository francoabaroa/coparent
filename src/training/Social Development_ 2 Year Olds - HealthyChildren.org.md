# Social Development: 2 Year Olds 

## Children this age can seem more concerned about 

## their own needs and act selfishly. They may refuse to 

## share things that interests them, and they do not 

## interact well with other children, even when playing 

## side by side—that is, unless they want a toy or object 

## from a playmate. 

## At times, your child's behavior may make you upset. But 

## if you take a close look, you'll notice that all other 

## children their age probably are acting the same way. 

## Learning empathy 

## At the same time, two-year-olds are developing the ability to express true empathy. You can help that process by 

## talking about how other people feel: "Emma is crying. She is sad because you took her car. Can you please give it 

## back?" Don't expect your two-year-old to always be able to control their behavior; she is still working on that skill. But 

## with your help they can practice and keep getting better 

## Is my two-year-old spoiled? 

## With such self-directed behavior, you may find yourself worrying that your two-year-old is spoiled or out of control. 

## Likely, your fears are unfounded, and they'll pass through this phase. Highly active, aggressive children who push and 

## shove usually are just as "normal" as quiet, shy ones who never seem to act out their thoughts and feelings. 

## Imitation & pretend play 

## Ironically, despite your child's apparent self-interest, they'll spend much of their playtime imitating other people's 

## mannerisms and activities. "Pretend" is a favorite game at this age. When your two-year-old puts their teddy to bed, 

## you may hear them use exactly the same words and tone of voice you use when telling them to go to sleep. No matter 

## how they otherwise resist your instructions, when your child moves over into the parent role, they imitate you exactly. 

## These play activities help your child learn what it's like to be in someone else's shoes, and serve as valuable rehearsals 

## for future social encounters. They'll also help you appreciate the importance of being a good role model, by 

## demonstrating that children often do as we do, not as we say. 

## Playgroups for two-year-olds 

## Your two-year-old will best learn how to behave around other people by being given plenty of trial runs. Don't let their 

## relatively antisocial behavior discourage you from getting playgroups together. At first it may be wise to limit the 

## groups to two or three children. And although you'll need to monitor the group so that no one gets hurt or overly 

## upset, you should let the children guide themselves as much as possible. They need to learn how to play with one 

## another, not with one another's parents.
