# Safety for Your Child: 2 to 4 Years Old 

## Between 2 and 4 years old, children are growing and 

## developing so quickly that parents and caregivers may 

## not be aware of what their little ones can do. Before you 

## know it your child will be jumping, running, riding a 

## tricycle, and using tools. 

## At this age, your child doesn't understand dangers or 

## remember "no" while playing and exploring. They are at 

## special risk for injuries from falls, drowning, poisons, 

## burns, and car crashes. In fact, injuries are the leading 

## cause of death of children younger than 4 years old in 

## the United States. 

## Here are 5 common injuries in children this age, and ways you can help prevent 

## them. 

## Falls 

## Because your child's abilities are so great now, they will find an endless variety of dangerous situations at home and in 

## the neighborhood. 

## Your child can fall off play equipment, out of windows (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/Home-Safety

## Heres-How.aspx), down stairs, off a bike or tricycle, and off anything that can be climbed on. Be sure the surface under 

## play equipment (/English/safety-prevention/at-play/Pages/Safety-Tips-For-Home-Playground-Equipment.aspx) is soft 

## enough to absorb a fall. Use safety tested mats or loose-fill materials (shredded rubber, sand, woodchips or bark) 

## maintained to a depth of at least 9 inches underneath play equipment. Install the protective surface at least 6 feet 

## (more for swings and slides) in all directions from the equipment. 

## Lock the doors to any dangerous areas (/English/safety-prevention/at-play/Pages/Pool-Dangers-Drowning

## Prevention-When-Not-Swimming-Time.aspx). Use gates on stairways and install operable window guards above the 

## first floor. Fence in the play yard. If your child has a serious fall or does not act normally after a fall, call your doctor. 

## Firearm hazards 

## Children in homes where guns (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/Handguns-in-the-Home.aspx) are present 

## are in more danger of being shot by themselves, their friends, or family members than of being injured by an intruder. 

## It is best to keep all guns out of the home. If you choose to keep a gun, keep it unloaded and in a locked place, with 

## ammunition locked separately. Handguns are especially dangerous. Ask if the homes where your child visits or is 

## cared for have guns and how they are stored. 

## Burns 

## The kitchen can be a dangerous place for your child, especially when you are cooking. If your child is underfoot, hot 

## liquids, grease, and hot foods can spill on them and cause serious burns (/English/health-issues/injuries

## emergencies/Pages/Treating-and-Preventing-Burns.aspx). Find something safe for your child to do while you are 

## cooking. 

## Remember that kitchen appliances and other hot surfaces such as irons, ovens, wall heaters and outdoor grills can 

## burn your child long after you have finished using them.

#### To protect your child from tap water scalds (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/Bathroom-Safety.aspx), the 

#### hottest temperature at the faucet should be no more than 120°F. In many cases you can adjust your hot water heater. 

#### Make sure you have a working smoke alarm on every level of your home, especially in furnace and sleeping areas. 

#### Test the alarms every month. It is best to use smoke alarms with long-life batteries, but if you do not, change the 

#### batteries at least once a year. 

## Poisonings 

### Your child will be able to open any drawer and climb anywhere curiosity leads. Your child may swallow anything they 

#### find. Use only household products and medicines that are absolutely necessary, and keep them safely capped and out 

#### of sight and reach. Keep all products in their original containers. Use medications as directed and safely dispose of 

#### unused medicine as soon as you are done with it. 

#### If your child does put something poisonous (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/Childproofing-Your

#### Home.aspx) in his or her mouth, call the Poison Help Line immediately. Attach the Poison Help Line number (1

#### 800-222-1222) to your phone contacts list. Do not make your child vomit. 

## Car & traffic-related crashes 

#### Car crashes are the greatest danger to your child's life and health. The crushing forces to your child's brain and body 

#### in a collision or sudden stop, even at low speeds, can cause injuries or death. 

#### To prevent these injuries, it is important to correctly USE a car safety seat (/English/safety-prevention/on-the

#### go/Pages/Car-Safety-Seats-Information-for-Families.aspx) EVERY TIME your child is in the car. 

#### It is safest for children to ride rear-facing as long as possible, until they reach the highest weight or height allowed by 

#### the manufacturer. Many convertible seats have limits that will permit children to ride rear-facing for 2 years or more. 

#### When they outgrow rear facing, children should ride forward-facing in a car safety seat with a harness. Many of these 

#### can be used up to 65 pounds or more, and this will help provide the most protection possible. 

#### The safest place for all children to ride is in the back seat. In an emergency, if a child must ride in the front seat, move 

#### the vehicle seat back as far as it can go, away from the air bag. 

#### Do not allow your child to play or ride a tricycle in the street. Driveways are also dangerous. Walk behind your car 

#### before you back out of your driveway to be sure your child is not behind your car. You may not see your child through 

#### the rear-view mirror. 

## Remember 

#### The biggest threat to your child's life and health is an injury. If you have any questions about keeping your child safe 

#### and preventing injuries, talk with their pediatrician.
