# Let the Brushing Games Begin 

## By: Laura A. Jana, MD, FAAP & Jennifer Shu, MD, FAAP 

## It usually takes quite a while before children can 

## master toothbrushing for themselves. Here are some 

## practical suggestions to help you make brushing more 

## fun for them and a matter of routine. 

## Start early. No teeth? No problem. Simply going 

## through the motions by regularly brushing and 

## cleaning gums still serves a very useful purpose. 

## Brush often. While we focus a lot on bedtime 

## (/English/healthy-living/oral-health/Pages/Brush

## Book-Bed.aspx) brushing, technically speaking, your goal of brushing teeth is to clean food off of them, and the 

## sooner the better. Yet few adults we know make a regular habit of brushing their teeth throughout the day. Start 

## having your child brush after meals early in life and you stand a fighting chance of creating a lasting habit. 

## Sing, sing a song. Or set a timer. Or come up with some other creative way to keep your child engaged in the act 

## of brushing her teeth for the recommended 2 minutes, or for at least as long as it takes to make sure that your 

## combined efforts leave them clean. Some toothbrushes even light up or play music for the amount of time a 

## child should keep brushing, preventing kids from being fooled into thinking that they've brushed long enough. 

## Check it out. If your child is showing signs of independence and insists on brushing on their own, then by all 

## means let her. Just don't forget to get in the habit of proudly "checking out" their work at the end of each session 

## while casually doing some touch-ups of your own. 

## Appeal to taste. If Cinderella, the Cat in the Hat, a race car, or an electric toothbrush similar to yours has better 

## prospects of winning your child over than you do, then by all means oblige. Feel free to indulge their tastes by 

## letting them choose toothbrushes and toothpaste that they can really get excited about. There are also many 

## flavored toothpastes that taste great and make it fun to brush. 

## Hands off. Right around the age when you're likely to start brushing, your child is likely to start grabbing. By 

## giving them a soft-bristled brush (or 2) of their own to have and to hold, you will be able to avoid a fight over yours 

## —leaving you well equipped to get the job done. Sure, it may take 3 toothbrushes instead of 1, but it's a small price 

## to pay for a routine that really works. 

## Go where no child has gone before. We suggest you pay particular heed (and direct your child's attention) to 

## those teeth that are most likely to be neglected. While you're helping them brush, describe what you're doing in 

## terms they can relate to by pointing out their "biting" teeth (the chewing surfaces), their "smile teeth 

## (/English/healthy-living/oral-health/pages/First-Steps-to-a-Healthy-Smile.aspx)" (you guessed it—right in the 

## front), and the tricky teeth in the back. Your goal— to teach your child to leave no plaque unturned. 

## Toothpaste temptations 

## All children can benefit from fluoride (/English/healthy-living/oral-health/Pages/FAQ-Fluoride-and-Children.aspx), 

## but it's important to use the right amount of toothpaste. Current recommendations advise using a smear of fluoride 

## toothpaste (or an amount about the size of a grain of rice) for children younger than 3 and a pea-sized amount for 

## children 3 to 6. Since the fluoride found in toothpaste is clearly meant to be swished but not swallowed, make sure to 

## help or watch your child while brushing. When they are old enough, tell them to spit out the toothpaste after 

## brushing.
