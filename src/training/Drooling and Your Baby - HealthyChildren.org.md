# Drooling and Your Baby 

## Drooling and blowing bubbles is common in babies during the 

## phase of development when getting what they need is centered on 

## the mouth. This becomes especially apparent at 3 to 6 months of 

## age. The increased flow of saliva that often signals the appearance 

## of a new tooth (/English/ages-stages/baby/teething-tooth

## care/Pages/Teething-4-to-7-Months.aspx) seems to soothe tender 

## gums; however, if your baby appears to be drooling excessively and 

## looks ill, she may be having trouble swallowing, which requires 

## medical attention. 

## The Role of Saliva 

## Drooling fulfills several important functions for your baby. 

## Softens and moistens food once solids (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Starting-Solid

## Foods.aspx) are part of your baby's diet 

## Keeps your baby's mouth moist 

## Makes it easier for your baby him to swallow 

## Washes away food residues 

## Protects your baby's teeth 

## Saliva also contains ptyalin, a digestive enzyme that changes starch into sugar. A natural antacid in saliva neutralizes 

## stomach acid and aids digestion. Saliva also protects against tooth decay (/English/ages-stages/baby/teething-tooth
