# How Cigarette Advertisements Influence Teens 

## By: Carol Duh-Leong, MD, MPP, FAAP 

## Each year, tobacco companies spend billions of dollars 

## to promote their products, including electronic 

## cigarettes (/English/ages-stages/teen/substance

## abuse/Pages/E-cigarettes.aspx) that are especially 

## popular with young people. Research shows these 

## advertisements reach, and strongly influence, children 

## and teens. 

## Smoke Signals 

## Nearly 7 out of 10 middle and high school students say 

## they've seen e-cigarette ads, for example, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 

## (https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/ecigarette-ads/index.html). Statistics like these worry public health experts, since 

## studies show the more cigarette ads teens see, the more likely they are to try smoking. Research also suggests that 

## seeing characters who smoke in movies makes them more likely to try cigarettes. 

## Many teens who try smoking don't stop. In fact, about 9 out of 10 smokers began the habit by age 18, according to a U.S. 

## Surgeon General report (https://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/reports/preventing-youth-tobacco

## use/factsheet.html). 

## Teens go through big developmental changes, forming their own identities and taking more risks. They also begin to 

## pay more attention to being accepted by friends. One study 

## (http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/139/6/e20163353)found that cigarette ads may make teens feel like 

## smoking would make them popular, sophisticated, attractive or tough. 

## What Parents Can Do 

## Be aware of and discuss how seemingly subtle points in cigarette ads can send a powerful, and potentially harmful, 

## message to teens. 

## Talk with your teen. Teens really do value the opinions of their parents. If you are with your teen and you see a 

## cigarette ad, talk about it. Tell your teen that his or her feelings are important, and start a constructive and 

## respectful discussion where both of you can express your feelings and opinions about smoking. 

## Think beyond tobacco. E-cigarettes and other electronic smoking devices, such as hookah (/English/health

## issues/conditions/tobacco/Pages/Hookah.aspx), might be advertised as less harmful to health than regular 

## cigarettes. Ads may make a point of saying that e-cigarettes vaporize flavored “vape juice" rather than burning 

## tobacco. Make sure your teen knows the nicotine from vaping is still highly addictive. In addition, research 

## (http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2017/11/30/peds.2017-1832) shows teens who use e

## cigarettes are more likely to smoke regular tobacco. This research supports the concept that e-cigs serve as a 

## “gateway" to traditional cigarettes. 

## Monitor screen time. Many teens exposed to cigarette ads, especially those for e-cigarettes, report seeing them 

## on the internet and TV (unlike ads for regular cigarettes, e-cigarette ads are legally allowed to air on TV). A 2018 

## study (http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2017/12/29/peds.2017-2927) in Pediatrics found that 

## teenagers who watched videos about tobacco products online, for example, were more likely to try and use 

## tobacco products more frequently. They were also less likely to stop using the products. Make a family media use 

## plan (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/How-to-Make-a-Family-Media-Use-Plan.aspx) to help limit the influence 

## of these ads on your children.

### Identify your teen's talents. Adolescence is a time when teens are trying to find their identity. It is important for 

### parents to be positive about their teen's talents and goals—whether it be basketball or social studies. This will 

### help them develop a strong sense of identity outside of potentially unhealthy habits. 

### Get involved in the community. Whether it be with the school's parent-teacher association or local health 

### programs in your city, parents have a strong voice in the community (/english/family

### life/community/pages/default.aspx). You can say no to cigarette ads in places where your child lives and plays. 

### Shop Around. If your local pharmacy or mini-mart displays cigarette ads, consider shopping at stores that do not 

### sell traditional cigarettes or e-cigarettes. 

## Remember 

### Cigarette ads can have a strong influence on children and teens. But there are steps you can take to protect against 

### their powerful pull, helping kids avoid a future clouded by tobacco and nicotine.
