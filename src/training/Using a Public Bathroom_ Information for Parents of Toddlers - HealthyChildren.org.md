# Using a Public Bathroom: Information for Parents of 

# Toddlers 

## Helping an opposite-sex child on the toilet is certainly easier during the toddler years. As 

## children grow and become more aware of gender differences 

## (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/Gender

## Differences.aspx)—and more aware of their surroundings in general—public bathrooms can 

## become an increasingly uncomfortable place for both parent and child. 

## It is best to take your child to the bathroom corresponding with your own gender through at least 

## age four. After that, if he objects or if you feel uncomfortable, you may decide to send him into his 

## own gender’s bathroom while you wait within hearing distance right outside the door. 

## First, though, help him practice removing and refastening his clothes, flushing the toilet and washing his hands 

## (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/prevention/Pages/Hand-Washing-A-Powerful

## Antidote-to-Illness.aspx), and performing all the other routines of bathroom use that you have been reinforcing up to 

## now. 

## Now is also a good time to reinforce the concept of “private parts” and to instruct him to come to you immediately if 

## he is approached in the bathroom by someone he doesn’t know.
