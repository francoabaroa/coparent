# Welcome To The World of Parenting! 

## Newborns Are Delightful—and Tiring 

## Newborns may sleep only a few hours at a time. 

## A newborn’s ability to hear, see, smell, and feel grows every day. 

## Parents can help crying babies calm down by making them feel warm, close, and 

## comfortable—just like it was in the womb. 

## Since all parents can get upset from crying babies, it’s important to know when and how to 

## ask for help. 

## Friends and family can share the delight and the work of caring for newborns. 

## Your baby is finally here. Congratulations! 

## Baby’s Sleep and Mother’s Rest 

## Newborns usually sleep 16 to 17 hours a day, but they may sleep for only a couple of hours at a time. 

## Many babies wake up every 2 to 4 hours, day or night. 

## New mothers need plenty of rest after childbirth to get their strength and energy back. 

## Mother and baby can take a nap at the same time. 

## As the new father supports mom during her recovery, he can enjoy getting to know this new addition to the 

## family! 

## Information For Dads 

## It’s A New Life For You 

## Your role as a father will bring about some big changes in your life. The physical, emotional, and financial demands of 

## being a dad can cause stress. You also may feel a little left out during the first few weeks, since much of the attention is 

## on your new baby and the mom. By becoming actively involved with your new baby, feelings of stress and being left 

## out will decrease. You will begin to: 

## Enjoy the pleasure of being a dad. 

## Strengthen your relationship with your baby’s mother. 

## Contribute to the well-being of your baby. 

## Ways For You To Be Involved 

## Your baby already Knows Who You Are From Hearing Your Voice before birth. 

## As you hold your baby in your arms, enjoy the feeling of your baby cuddling up to you. 

## Have fun as you spend time talking to your new baby. 

## If you have older children, they will need your support now While their mother is tired and focused on the new 

## baby. 

## When Your Baby Cries A LOT 

## Sometimes, we just don’t know why babies are crying! So, what can you do? Think about what it was like when your 

## baby was in the womb, and try to create a similar experience. 

## Calmly hold your baby close to your shoulder or chest—inside the womb, it was warm and close. 

## Swaddle (wrap) your baby in a blanket— toward the end of pregnancy, it was very crowded. 

## Quietly sing or talk to your baby, softly play calm music—voices heard through the womb were very comforting. 

## Gently rock your baby or go for a quiet walk— before birth, your baby was used to quietly floating.

#### There will be a few times when babies will continue to cry until either sleep finally arrives or they become quiet yet 

#### alert. Comforting babies when they cry does not spoil them. In fact, many babies learn how to calm themselves just by 

#### knowing that someone will calm them. 

#### Sometimes, babies will continue to fuss after parents have tried everything! They are crying because they have had all 

#### the excitement that they can handle for now. This is when it’s best to quietly hold your baby, or put your baby in a safe 

#### place, like the crib, and wait until all is calm. 

## Crying Babies Upset Parents 

#### All parents get upset when their baby cries. With all this crying, try to stay patient. Your baby can sense when you are 

#### upset or tense. 

#### After trying all the ways that usually calm your baby, it’s ok to let your baby cry. It’s ok to place your baby, face up, in 

#### the crib to calm down. It’s ok to let your baby cry sometimes and give yourself time to calm down. Do something that 

#### you enjoy and find calming—have a cup of tea or coffee, listen to music, call a friend or spouse, read, or meditate. 

#### These feelings of stress are natural and will pass. 

#### If your baby’s crying is getting to be too much— and it does get to this point for many parents— reach out for help. 

#### Talk with a friend or relative who has been through this, or call your pediatrician. 

## Information For Moms 

#### Becoming a parent brings big changes to your life—more than you might have imagined! 

### You May Feel Tired Much of The Time 

#### Your body is recovering from pregnancy and childbirth. At times, you may wonder if you will be able to make it 

#### through the first month. This is common and normal. Let family and friends help out with meals, shopping, cleaning, 

#### and if you have other children, taking care of them. Don’t feel that you need to entertain visitors as well! 

### You May Have Wild Mood Swings 

#### As your body begins to adjust, you may go from great highs to hopeless lows. This is common during the first weeks 

#### after giving birth, but please let people know if you feel down or overwhelmed. 

#### Your feelings deserve attention and support from your family and friends, and from your doctors. If you think you 

#### need help, ask for it. Taking care of your emotional and physical health also helps your baby. 

### You May Feel Lonely 

#### Some of your links to family and friends will get stronger, while others may get weaker. Some people will understand 

#### what you are going through, and others won’t. Your baby needs and will demand much of your attention, time, and 

#### energy. If you are a mom who also works outside of the home, chances are you are not seeing friends from work at this 

#### time. Try reaching out to family and friends, or find other new mothers who live near you.
