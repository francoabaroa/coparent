# Food and Media: Not a Healthy Mix 

## Media are an important part of our lives—from computers, laptops, 

## tablets, and smartphones that let us learn, communicate, and 

## create, to movies and TV—and movies streamed on smart TVs that 

## entertain and inspire us. But, not everything we see, hear, and learn 

## about on digital media in our world is good for us. 

## Media can bring us messages from advertisers—aiming to sell us 

## products that can keep our family from ideal wellness or even harm 

## our health. For example, fast food advertising can make eating right 

## very difficult. And, eating in front of a screen can lead children and 

## adults to take in excess calories and promote obesity. Too much 

## sedentary media time can also displace healthy physical activity 

## and play. 

## Digital Media & Babies 

## Studies have shown that excessive TV watching is associated with obesity and overweight in children. One way to 

## avoid this outcome is to limit digital media/screen time to no more than one hour a day for children ages 18-24 

## months and beyond. See Why to Avoid TV for Infants and Toddlers (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/Why-to-Avoid

## TV-Before-Age-2.aspx). 

## What Parents Can Do: 

## Digital media is not appropriate for children younger than 18 months, because babies need 3D, real world 

## interactions with you and other family members to learn and grow. 

## Avoid using TV, digital media, or apps as a babysitter. Instead, look for ways to interact with your child face to 

## face. 

## If you are going to use digital media with your 1 ½ to 2-year-old and beyond, co-view the programs or play the 

## games with your child. Children learn better when they hear a parent or caregiver repeat an electronic word or 

## message. 

## Of course, it's okay to video chat with a relative through a screen. Just stay by your child's side to engage everyone 

## in an active conversation. 

## Media-Free Meals 

## There is plenty of unconscious eating that can take place in front of a TV or other screen. It's easy for kids to simply 

## eat their way from one program to the next. Distracted by the TV or the app, they'll often eat long beyond when they're 

## full. The result? Weight gain. Plus, too much screen time is likely to keep your child from engaging in active play and 

## important face-to-face communications with friends and family. 

## What Parents Can Do: 

## Make your meals media-free. Put all devices aside and focus on food and each other. 

## Serve your meals at the kitchen table with other family members as often as possible. Meal time 

## (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/Pages/The-Importance-of-Family-Routines.aspx)is an important time for 

## family conversations and sharing the day's experiences without media getting in the way.

## Media & Obesity 

#### Here's another important reason to limit your child's TV watching: the steady stream of ads for high-sugar 

#### (/English/health-issues/conditions/chronic/Pages/Causes-of-High-Blood-Glucose-and-Low-Blood-Glucose.aspx), 

#### high-fat (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/What-About-Fat-And-Cholesterol.aspx)foods aimed directly at 

#### children. Studies have shown that children who watch a lot of TV have a greater likelihood of becoming obese 

#### (/English/health-issues/conditions/obesity/Pages/Your-Overweight-Child-and-the-Risk-of-Disease.aspx). The 

#### commercials targeted at children are one of the reasons why. 

### What Parents Can Do: 

#### Do not allow children younger than 18 months to 2 years to watch TV or use digital media. 

#### Develop a Family Media Use Plan (/English/media/Pages/default.aspx) that ensures that media do not displace 

#### other healthy activities such as active play. 

#### Talk about the ads your child sees on TV and online and explain how they encourage unhealthy eating or 

#### behaviors. 

#### Stay strong when your child begs for the latest food or candy advertised. Explain why you think it's not healthy 

#### and offer a healthy substitute such as a vegetable or fruit if he or she is hungry for a snack. 

## Remember 

#### Even if your child doesn't eat in front of the TV, you still need to develop a Family Media Use Plan that allows enough 

#### time for healthy meals, adequate sleep, and enough physical activity. Develop your own Family Media Use Plan today
