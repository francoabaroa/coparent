# Problematic Toilet Behaviors 

## Some problematic toilet behaviors have physical origins. Others are caused by anxiety or other overwhelming 

## emotions. Many behaviors, however, are quite typical expressions of a normal child’s ongoing cognitive development. 

## The younger toddler’s ability to comprehend and respond to the body’s signals was noted as a necessary development 

## before toilet training should be attempted. Further developments that manifest over time can support or sabotage 

## bathroom habits—and, in some cases, do both. Forgetfulness and distractibility continue to challenge children, whose 

## memory capacity is still limited—particularly when a lot is happening or things are changing in their lives. Difficulty 

## breaking focus in time to get to the bathroom leads to accidents as well. 

## Toddlers’ and preschoolers’ cognitive growth allows them to think more about and test the limits parents impose— 

## leading to deliberate violations of bathroom routines. Finally, while preschoolers’ greatly expanded imagination helps 

## them think and learn about toilet use through play, it can lead to resistance as children imagine disaster looming each 

## time the toilet is flushed. Enhanced imagination is also responsible for such “magical-thinking” practices as 

## depositing stool in strange places, avoiding certain bathrooms or insisting on using only one particular potty, refusing 

## to flush the toilet or flushing a ritual number of times, and so on. 

## Strange as some of these behaviors can appear to adults, they are perfectly reasonable from a child’s point of view. 

## Again, there is no point in criticizing your child for behavior he cannot help. In some cases, particularly those 

## involving confusion about toilet use, a series of brief, thoughtful conversations may ease the situation. 

## At other times, as when bathroom practices are violated as a way of testing boundaries, it’s important to reinstate your 

## rules and stand firmly behind them. As in the other instances described, your knowledge of your particular child 

## remains your best tool in deciding how to respond. As long as your child knows that you support his efforts but that 

## you expect him to return soon to correct bathroom behavior, the two of you will eventually reach your goal.
