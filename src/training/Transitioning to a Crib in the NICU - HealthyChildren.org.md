# Transitioning to a Crib in the NICU 

## Maintaining body temperature involves calories and oxygen. The more energy your baby uses to 

## keep warm, the less he will have for growing and healing. 

## Your baby will progress from the incubator or radiant warmer to an open crib based on his ability 

## to regulate body temperature. 

## Regulating Body Temperature 

## This ability depends, in part, on gestational age and weight (/English/ages

## stages/baby/preemie/pages/Corrected-Age-For-Preemies.aspx). The transition is usually gradual, but your baby may 

## be returned to the warmer environment at the first sign of inability to maintain temperature. It’s not unusual for a 

## baby’s weight gain to slow, or even for weight to drop, for a day or so during the weaning process to an open crib.
