# Is Your Baby’s Physical Development on Track? 

## You know your child best. So, it's important you 

## share your concerns with your pediatrician if you 

## think your little one's development isn't exactly on 

## track. 

## Typically, children develop motor skills from the head 

## down. First comes head control and then control over 

## the upper body. The typical pattern for motor 

## milestones is rolling over, then sitting, pulling up, 

## standing, walking, and climbing. Small, fine motor 

## skills, such as grasping objects, putting blocks in a cup, 

## and scribbling are important milestones, too. 

## Physical developmental delays or early motor delays are terms used to describe when children are not meeting 

## critical physical milestones in the first months and years of life – how well and soon they move and interact with their 

## environment. These delays can be a sign of something more serious, so it is important to talk with your child's 

## pediatrician about them. 

## Signs of a Physical Developmental or Early Motor Delay 

## Delayed rolling over, sitting, or walking 

## Poor head and neck control 

## Muscle stiffness or floppiness 

## Speech delay 

## Swallowing difficulty 

## Body posture that is limp or awkward 

## Clumsiness 

## Muscle spasms 

## Common Concerns from Parents about Delayed Physical 

## Development 

## My child doesn't seem to be growing the way he should. 

## My child seems very stiff and tight in the way she moves. 

## My child is weak and limp like a rag doll. 

## My child isn't keeping up with children of the same age when they play together. 

## My child seems to get tired very quickly. 

## If either of the above lists of signs and concerns sound familiar or if you have other 

## any other worries, speak up! Usually a child who is late doing certain activities catches up 

## to other children. But sometimes, developing late is the sign of a health condition. An estimated 400,000 babies born 


#### each year in the United States are at risk for some form of neuromuscular condition, and one in 40 are actually born 

#### with an early motor delay. Spotting these signs and finding the health condition as early as possible will help your 

#### child get the care he or she needs. 

## Physical Developmental Delays: What to Look For 

#### (http://motordelay.aap.org/)When trying to spot an early motor delay, 

#### it is helpful to know the signs of typical and atypical physical 

#### development. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), created an 

#### online tool for parents called Physical Developmental Delays: What to 

#### Look For (http://motordelay.aap.org/). 

#### (http://motordelay.aap 

#### .org/)This tool 

#### features an interactive 

#### experience to learn 

#### more about physical 

#### developmental delays 

#### in children 5 and 

#### under and can serve 

#### as a guide if you have a 

#### feeling that something is wrong. You are also able to create a checklist of items to help start a conversation with your 

#### child's pediatrician. 

#### Note: This tool only focuses on a child's physical development. If you're worried about other developmental issues, 

#### like social, emotional, communication, or learning, visit the Learn the Signs. Act Early 

#### (http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/actearly/index.html). Also, keep in mind that if your child was born prematurely (before 

#### 37 weeks of pregnancy) he or she may develop later than other children the same age. See Preemie Milestones 

#### (/English/ages-stages/baby/preemie/Pages/Preemie-Milestones.aspx). 

### Additional Resources for Assessing Your Baby's Physical Development 

#### Pathways.org offers free videos (http://pathways.org/watch/) and handouts (http://pathways.org/print/) that show 

#### typical and atypical physical development in infants at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. ChildMuscleWeakness.org also has 

#### a number of videos (http://www.childmuscleweakness.org/index.php/videos) and materials for families 

#### (http://www.childmuscleweakness.org/index.php/materials-for-families) to help recognize the first signs of 

#### childhood neuromuscular disorders. 

## Next Step: Talk with Your Pediatrician 

#### When you express concerns your child is development to the pediatrician, he or she will listen carefully and may ask 

#### you some additional questions. You may also be asked to complete screening questionnaire online or on paper; this is 

#### an assessment for developmental delays (/English/ages-stages/toddler/Pages/Assessing-Developmental-Delays.aspx). 

#### Parent observations are an important part of a pediatrician's evaluation. Pediatricians use parental input on these 

#### questionnaires as a basis for further examination and referral. See these tips from the CDC for talking with your 

#### child's pediatrician about development (http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/actearly/pdf/help_pdfs/cdc_talktodoctor.pdf).

### Common Therapy for Physical Developmental Delays 

#### Early intervention services (/English/health-issues/conditions/developmental-disabilities/Pages/Early

#### Intervention.aspx) include a variety of different resources and programs that provide support to families to enhance 

#### a child's development. These services are specifically tailored to meet a child's individual needs, and most 

#### commonly include pediatric physical, occupational (/English/health-issues/conditions/developmental

#### disabilities/Pages/Occupational-Therapy.aspx), and speech/language therapy (/English/health

#### issues/conditions/developmental-disabilities/Pages/Speech-Language-Therapy.aspx). 

#### If a child is delayed in large motor skills such as sitting up or walking, he or she may be referred to a physical 

#### therapist. 

#### If a child is having trouble understanding language, using language, or swallowing, he or she may be seen by a 

#### speech/language therapist. 

#### If the child is having trouble with fine motor skills, visual motor skills or independent living skills, such as 

#### feeding himself, picking up small objects, or buttoning his clothes, he or she may be referred to an occupational 

#### therapist. 

## Finding Support if a Health Condition is Identified 

#### If a specific diagnosis is found in your child, your pediatrician can help you connect with special support groups and 

#### other resources for parents in your community. Parent support organizations such as Parent Project Muscular 

#### Dystrophy (http://endduchenne.org/) help you figure out what to do, especially in the first few weeks following a 

#### diagnosis, and offer you support in parenting a child with a special need. Some other conditions have well organized 

#### societies, such as the National Down Syndrome Society (http://www.ndss.org/), United Cerebral Palsy 

#### (http://www.ucp.org/), and the Muscular Dystrophy Association (http://www.mda.org/).
