# Playing is How Toddlers Learn 

## Play is how your toddler explores and learns about the 

## world as they grow and develop. 

## As a parents or caregiver, you can support and 

## encourage this play. Allow your child lots of time to 

## play, and join in the fun when you can! 

## Play is how young children start 

## to get ready for school 

## They learn how to feel comfortable being with 

## other children, and how to be a good friend. 

## Play gets children ready for learning—paying attention to adults, playing nicely with others, and feeling 

## comfortable being away from their parents. 

## Pretend play is one way children learn about difficult feelings like anger and fear. 

## TIP: Make the places in your home where you spend a lot of time safe places where your child can play and be 

## supervised easily. Give your child lots of time to explore with things like water, sand, boxes, or any other safe item that 

## your child finds interesting. 

## TIP: Provide simple and safe items, like plastic cups and plates, pots and pans, books, blocks, play tools, and crayons. 

## This way, your child can copy your actions and work. Items should be stored in a safe place or in a container where 

## children can easily see and get to them. 

## TIP: Describe what's going on to your child: 

## "I see you drew a brown circle." 

## "What a long jump you made!" 

## TIP: Ask questions. 

## "How did you make this yummy soup?" 

## "What will happen next?" 

## TIP: Find items that match your child's interests. If your child likes to watch ants crawl along the sidewalk, read a book 

## about insects! 

## TIP: Visit special places related to your child's interests. You can start with a visit to your local library. You will get 

## ideas for future play. 

## When you let your child guide the activities, you get a window into the delightful world of a toddler—a world where 

## everything is new and full of possibility. 

## Child's play can be hard work for parents 

## Playing with your child takes a lot of time and energy. When you are tired, your toddler will know it. Find time for 

## yourself. Maybe your family can help out, or perhaps a friend will watch your child for a few hours. You will come back 

## with more energy and joy. If you are having fun, chances are your child is having fun, and learning, too.
