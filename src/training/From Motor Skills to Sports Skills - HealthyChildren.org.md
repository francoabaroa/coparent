# From Motor Skills to Sports Skills 

## Children in the 2to 5-year-old age group get their motivation and develop motor skills from self

## play behaviors. Active games and play in the backyard, with friends at the park, or in heavily 

## padded rooms can provide great sources of exercise in addition to nurturing that important 

## relationship between parent and child. 

## Toddlers and preschoolers spend a lot of time just trying to master basic fundamental skills such 

## as running, skipping, kicking, jumping, hopping, catching, and throwing. Kids acquire most of 

## these skills by early elementary school. 

## Adults may not be able to understand that these activities really do take some effort for children. Much of the 

## maturation process of controlling movement in children involves being able to move in different ways without falling 

## over. Obviously, mastering those basic skills is a fundamental step children have to complete before they can proceed 

## much further. 

## Infants may rely mostly on visual and oral information, but toddlers move away from the mouth being Command 

## Central. They begin to process signals and cues from their brains and inner ears that may even cause a temporary 

## decrease in their ability to maintain good balance as they approach their fourth or fifth birthdays. 

## Children can become overloaded with these signals while walking or running, and they must concentrate just to stay 

## upright. Putting all of their attention into balance control may temporarily interfere with their ability to improve 

## performance in other skills if there are other variables in the environment, such as many other players or uneven 

## playing surfaces. Certainly with time, the act of jumping up and down and running around becomes easier without 

## requiring as much focus to stay vertical. 

## If we could see what is going on in the minds of some young children, it might be very educational. While adults are 

## yelling, “Get the ball! Get the ball!” the child may be thinking, “Don’t fall down! Don’t fall down!” That is why early 

## soccer teams have been referred to as beehive soccer—many players simply swarm and follow the ball just trying to 

## kick it, much to the dismay of the coach, who realizes that none of them are following the instructions of the detailed 

## play outlined just moments before. 

## There is obviously a wide range of abilities in this age group, but relatively few children are really talented at these 

## basic skills. It has been found that fewer than one third of 2to 5-year-olds are truly effective at throwing and catching.
