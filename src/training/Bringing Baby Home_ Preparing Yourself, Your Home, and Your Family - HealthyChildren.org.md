# Bringing Baby Home: Preparing Yourself, Your Home, and 

# Your Family 

## “On the day our baby came home from the hospital, we showered most of the attention on his big 

## sister. She wore her “big sister” shirt to day care and took cupcakes to celebrate. She had her 

## dinner on a special new plate just for big sisters. She felt very important, and that helped her 

## adjust to having a new baby in the house.” 

## As your baby grows and heals in the intermediate care nursery, you will have a lot to do. It can be 

## overwhelming at times. Go slowly, but don’t procrastinate. Preparation gives you a chance to 

## mobilize some of your anxious energy to make a difference in your child’s future. 

## Preparing for an Emergency 

## Graduates of NICUs have a higher rate of re-hospitalization than the average newborn population. Common reasons 

## for unexpected readmission are dehydration because of vomiting or diarrhea, upper respiratory infections, hernia 

## complications, persistent or increased apnea, or shunt repair. 

## Now is the time to prepare for an emergency, before one arises. Before your baby is discharged, go to the hospital 

## where your baby is most likely to be readmitted. Know the fastest route from your house, and an alternate route, as 

## well as the locations of the hospital’s emergency entrance, parking, and admitting office. Be prepared to call the EMS 

## system for an ambulance if you believe your baby’s condition is critical, however. Post 911 or your community’s EMS 

## number on all of your phones and program your baby’s care providers’ numbers in your cell phones as well. Being 

## ready will prevent panic in case of an emergency. 

## If you know your baby will come home with a cardiac monitor, a ventilator, or oxygen, you also need to contact public 

## services to ensure that you will receive priority help in community emergencies. The EMS system (or nearest fire 

## station) and your utility providers (water, electric, and gas) should all be aware that you have a baby with special needs 

## in your home. Ask your baby’s nurse, case manager, or discharge planner for this letter to send to your utility 

## companies. Be sure to notify them when your child is no longer technology dependent or if you move. 

## Housecleaning 

## Many parents feel they must “sterilize” their home with industrial-type cleaning products to eliminate germs and 

## dust before their baby’s homecoming. The family pet may be permanently banished outdoors or given to a new 

## owner. Although the intent behind these precautions is admirable, they often are not necessary and generally are 

## impossible to keep up. Few families can maintain such high standards of cleanliness while giving baby care and 

## normal living the priorities they must have. Rely on common sense as you prepare—and maintain—your home. A 

## thorough cleaning is enough. Harsh cleaning solutions and insecticidal sprays can leave residual odors that may 

## irritate or even harm your baby. 

## Tobacco Smoke 

## Babies—especially those who have had or are having breathing difficulties—are at risk for a number of problems from 

## exposure to tobacco smoke. No one should smoke in the home, around your baby, or anyplace where your baby spends 

## time, such as in the car. 

## The AAP Committee on Environmental Health has identified these problems with secondhand smoke exposure: 

## decreased lung growth, decreased lung function, and increased frequency of lower respiratory tract infections and 

## respiratory symptoms. Research also clearly shows that exposure to smoke can cause ear infections and related 

## hearing problems, increased incidence of hospitalization related to bronchitis or pneumonia, and increased risk for 

## SIDS. If you need more information or literature—for example, to convince family or close friends of the dangers of 

## secondhand smoke to your baby—contact the American Lung Association or the AAP Julius B. Richmond Center of 

## Excellence (http://www.aap.org/richmondcenter).

## Pets 

### Pets are important members of the family. Banishing a beloved companion may cause resentment. Instead, prepare 

### your pet for your baby’s arrival. Bring home clothing or a blanket with your baby’s scent on it before your baby is 

### discharged. Siblings can help by spending extra time with the pet. Be alert for signs of aggression or jealousy when 

### your baby comes home, and never leave your dog or cat unsupervised near your new baby. 

### Extra attention and discipline will solve most problems. Keeping your pet out of your baby’s sleeping area may help 

### reduce the risk of fur or dander irritating the baby’s breathing passages. When your baby is developmentally mature 

### enough to lie outside the crib, place a clean blanket or mat under the baby to keep fur, dander, dust, and carpet fibers 

### from irritating the baby’s airway during playtime. Carefully assess all of the factors involved in having a pet, and talk 

### with your health care provider as you decide on a reasonable approach. 

## Siblings 

### Prepare your older children for what life may be like when their baby brother or sister comes home. Plan to spend 

### special time alone with each of your other children a short time after your baby comes home and repeat this daily. 

### Encourage and allow them to talk about their feelings. This should reduce episodes of acting out. Most parenting 

### books include information on helping siblings adjust to a new baby. 

## Visitors 

### You’ll need a traffic control plan for visitors. Start thinking about this before your baby’s discharge, and set up a 

### visiting schedule. Don’t turn down offers of help, but use your calendar to keep track of who is planning to visit. Place 

### limits on the number of visitors to your home. Your needs deserve top priority, and entertaining others is probably not 

### at the top of your list right now. Let friends and extended family know that you’ll need some time to adjust to this new 

### baby at home and that you’ll let them know when you’re ready for visitors. Caring family and friends will respect your 

### need for privacy and give you the time you need to make this adjustment.
