# A Special Message to New Dads 

## While this time can be challenging for new fathers, it can also be 

## uniquely rewarding. 

## Adjusting Priorities 

## Just as mothers occasionally need to readjust their priorities, 

## fathers now have a golden opportunity to show more of their 

## nurturing side by caring for Mom, the baby, and possibly other 

## siblings. Although not all fathers have the option of paternity leave 

## from work, those who do and take advantage of it may find it 

## priceless. If Mom was the center of a sibling's universe and Dad was 

## only an afterthought, Dad may suddenly be more "cool" once a 

## newborn comes home. 

## By adjusting his priorities (at home and at work (/English/family-life/work-play/Pages/Working-Parents.aspx)) and 

## "rising to the occasion," Dad can strengthen an already strong bond with Mom as well as with the new child. 

## By working as a team (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/Pages/Roles-Within-the-Family.aspx), parenting couples 

## may be amazed at how well they can adapt to their new, stressful circumstances (/English/healthy-living/emotional

## wellness/Building-Resilience/Pages/When-Things-Arent-Perfect-Caring-for-Yourself-Your-Children.aspx). 

## Teamwork 

## Of course, balancing (/English/family-life/work-play/Pages/Avoiding-Burnout.aspx) the seemingly constant demands 

## of the baby, the needs of other children, and the household chores is not always easy. Nights spent feeding 

## (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/default.aspx), diapering (/english/ages-stages/baby/diapers

## clothing/Pages/default.aspx), and walking the floor with a crying (/English/ages-stages/baby/crying

## colic/Pages/default.aspx) baby can quickly take their toll in fatigue for both parents. But by working as a team to 

## relieve each other for naps, for exercise, and for "downtime," parenting couples might find that even though they share 

## less "quality time" together, they may actually feel closer than ever. Sometimes there may be conflict and jealous 

## feelings. These are normal, and thankfully, temporary. Life soon settles into a fairly regular routine (/English/family

## life/family-dynamics/Pages/The-Importance-of-Family-Routines.aspx) that will once again give you some time to 

## yourselves and restore your sex life and social activities to normal. 

## Meanwhile, make an effort for just the two of you to spend some time together each day enjoying each other's 

## company while the baby is sleeping (/english/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/default.aspx) or somebody else is caring 

## for her. Remember, you're entitled to hold, hug, cuddle, and kiss each other as well as the baby. 

## Playing with Baby 

## A positive way for men to deal with these issues is to become as involved as possible in caring for and playing with the 

## new baby. When you spend this extra time with your child, you'll get just as emotionally attached to her as her mother 

## will. 

## This is not to say that moms and dads play with babies the same way. In general, fathers play to arouse and excite their 

## babies, while mothers generally concentrate on more low-key stimulation such as gentle rocking, quiet interactive 

## games, singing, and soothing activities. From the baby's viewpoint, both play styles are equally valuable and 

## complement each other beautifully, which is another reason why it's so important to have both of you involved in the 

## care of the baby.
