# Transitional Objects: Security Blankets & Beyond 

## Remember the Charles Schulz character Linus and his 

## blanket? He dragged it around wherever he went, 

## nibbling on its corner or curling up with it when the 

## going got tough. You may still remember your own 

## favorite childhood blanket, doll or teddy bear, too. 

## Security objects such as blankets are part of the 

## emotional support system every child needs in 

## their early years. 

## Your child may not choose a blanket, of course. They 

## may prefer a soft toy instead. Chances are they'll make 

## her choice between months eight and twelve, and keep 

## it for years to come. When your child is tired, it will 

## help them sleep. When they are separated from you, it will reassure them. When they are upset, it will comfort them. 

## When they're in a strange place, it will help them feel at home. 

## From dependence to independence 

## These special comforts are called transitional objects. They help children make the emotional transition from 

## dependence to independence. They work, in part, because they feel good: they're soft, cuddly, and nice to touch. 

## They're also effective because of familiarity. This "lovey" has your child's scent on it, and it reminds them of the 

## comfort and security of their room. It makes them feel everything is going to be OK. 

## Despite myths to the contrary, transitional objects are not a sign of weakness or insecurity, and there's no reason to 

## keep your child from using one. In fact, a transitional object can be so helpful you may want to help then choose one 

## and build it into their nighttime ritual. 

## Why having a duplicate is a good idea 

## The value of You can also make things easier by having two identical security objects. Doing this allows you to wash 

## one while the other is being used, thus sparing your baby (and yourself) a potential emotional crisis and a bedraggled 

## lovey. 

## If your baby chooses a large blanket for her security object, you can easily cut it into two. They have little sense of size 

## and won't notice. If they've chosen a toy instead, try to find a duplicate as soon as possible. If you don't start rotating 

## them early, your child may refuse the second one because it feels too new and foreign. 

## Don't worry about thumb sucking 

## Parents often worry that transitional objects promote thumb sucking, and in fact they sometimes do (but not always). 

## But it's important to remember that thumb or finger sucking is a normal, natural way for young children to comfort 

## themselves. They'll gradually give up both the transitional object and the sucking as they matures and find other ways 

## to cope with stress.
