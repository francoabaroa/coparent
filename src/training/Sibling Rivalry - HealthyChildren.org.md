# Sibling Rivalry 

## My children have trouble getting along. How can I help 

## them? 

## No matter how hard you try to keep the peace, your children are likely to fight over toys, tattle on 

## one another, and tease and criticize each other. Sibling rivalry is a natural part of growing up. 

## Here are some tips on managing conflict between your children. 

## Remember that each child's needs are different. 

## Some parents feel it's important to treat their children the same way. Yet children often complain that things are "not 

## fair" and that they are not receiving what the other sibling gets. Treating your children differently doesn't mean you 

## are playing favorites. It's a way of showing that you appreciate how special they are. 

## While it's natural to notice differences between your children, try not to 

## comment on these in front of them. 

## It is easy for a child to think that he is not as good or as loved as his sibling when you compare them. Remember, each 

## child is special. Let each one know that. 

## As much as possible, stay out of your children's arguments. 

## While you may have to help younger children find ways to settle their differences, do not take sides. If your children 

## try to involve you, explain that they need to figure out how to get along. Of course, you must get involved if the 

## situation gets violent. Make sure your children know that such behavior is not allowed. If there is any reason to 

## suspect that your children may become violent, watch them closely when they are together. Preventing violence is 

## always better than punishing after the fact, which often makes the rivalry worse. Praise your children when they solve 

## their arguments, and reward good behavior. 

## Be fair. 

## If you must get involved in your children's arguments, listen to all sides of the story. Also, give children privileges that 

## are right for their ages and try to be consistent. If you allowed one child to stay up until 9:00 pm at 10 years of age, the 

## other should have the same bedtime when he is 10. 

## Respect your child's privacy. 

## If it is necessary to punish or scold, do it with the child alone in a quiet, private place. Do not embarrass your child by 

## scolding him in front of the others. 

## Family meetings can be a great way to work out sibling issues. 

## Some parents find that sharing some of their own experiences about growing up can help too. Just listening to your 

## children can also help. Remember, this is their opportunity to learn about the give-and-take of human relationships.
