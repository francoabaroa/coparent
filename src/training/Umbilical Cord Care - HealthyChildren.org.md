# Umbilical Cord Care 

## The first few weeks after your baby is born, you'll need 

## to keep the stump of the umbilical cord clean and dry 

## as it shrivels and eventually falls off. 

## There is no need to use alcohol on the cord; just keep it 

## clean. Meanwhile, a quick submersion bath is fine 

## before the cord falls off, just dry the stump afterward. 

## Also, keep the diaper folded below the cord to keep 

## urine from soaking it. 

## You may notice a few drops of blood on the diaper 

## around the time the stump falls off; this is normal. But if 

## the cord actively bleeds, call your baby's doctor 

## immediately. If the stump becomes infected, it will require medical treatment. 

## Although cord infections are uncommon, you should contact your doctor if you 

## notice any of the following: 

## Foul-smelling yellowish discharge from the cord 

## Red skin around the base of the cord 

## Crying when you touch the cord or the skin next to it 

## The umbilical cord stump should dry and fall off by the time your baby is three weeks old. If it is still there beyond that 

## time, a doctor's visit is needed. 

## Umbilical Granuloma 

## Sometimes instead of completely drying, the cord will form a granuloma or a small reddened mass of scar tissue that 

## stays on the belly button after the umbilical cord has fallen off. This granuloma will drain a light-yellowish fluid. This 

## condition will usually go away in about a week, but if not, your pediatrician may need to burn off (cauterize) the 

## granulomatous tissue. 

## Umbilical Hernia 

## If your baby's umbilical cord area seems to push outward when she cries, she may have an umbilical hernia 

## (/English/health-issues/conditions/abdominal/Pages/umbilical-hernia-in-children.aspx)—a small hole in the 

## muscular part of the abdominal wall that allows the tissue to bulge out when there is increased abdominal pressure 

## (i.e., crying). This is not a serious condition, and it usually heals by itself in the first twelve to eighteen months. (For 

## unknown reasons it often takes longer to heal in African American babies.) 

## In the unlikely event it doesn't heal by three to five years of age, the hole may need surgery (/English/health

## issues/conditions/surgery/Pages/umbilical-hernia-surgery.aspx). Don't put tape or a coin on the navel. It will not help 

## the hernia, and it may cause a skin rash.
