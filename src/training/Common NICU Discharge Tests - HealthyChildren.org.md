# Common NICU Discharge Tests 

## While you're learning all you can about your baby's care, the discharge coordinator or case 

## manager is planning your baby's final tests and making preparations for discharge. Common 

## discharge tests are explained here, but not all NICU babies require all of the tests discussed. Ask 

## your baby's nurse what to expect as discharge draws near. 

## Eye exam 

## If your baby was 30 weeks' gestation or less or weighed less than 1,500 grams (3 pounds, 5 ounces) 

## at birth, they will have an eye examination (/English/health-issues/conditions/eyes/Pages/Vision

## Screenings.aspx) at between 4 and 7 weeks of age. Babies born after 30 weeks' gestation and weighing between 1,500 

## and 2,000 grams may also have this type of eye examination if they had an especially difficult NICU course. Follow-up 

## exams will be scheduled if the findings of the first exam warrant them. The exam is to identify any changes in the eye 

## tissue caused by retinopathy of prematurity. 

## Hearing test 

## Hearing tests (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Purpose-of-Newborn-Hearing-Screening.aspx)—also called 

## audiology screenings—are done in most nurseries before discharge. Electronic sound and response monitoring 

## determine if your baby can hear. Environmental conditions, such as surrounding noise or a crying baby, can cause 

## inconclusive results, however. If this happens, a retest should be scheduled in a more controlled environment. If your 

## baby responds to your voice or to noise-making toys held where they can't see them, there is usually no reason for 

## concern. 

## After discharge, your child's hearing should be monitored by your health care provider at periodic health exams. If 

## you are concerned about your baby's hearing, never hesitate to insist on a more extensive hearing exam. These are 

## available at a pediatric audiologist's office or in pediatric outpatient rehabilitation centers. 

## Newborn metabolic screening 

## Every baby is tested soon after birth to identify some rare but potentially serious or life-threatening conditions. The 

## number of tests varies by state. Newborn metabolic testing can yield inconclusive results if the baby is very 

## premature, is critically ill or needed a blood transfusion prior to metabolic testing. If the screening test suggests a 

## problem, your baby's doctor will speak directly with you and will order follow-up testing. Become aware of the 

## screening test results prior to discharge from the NICU and communicate the findings with your community 

## pediatrician. 

## Blood count 

## A final hematocrit or hemoglobin and reticulocyte level are usually done the week of discharge. Although it's unlikely, 

## your baby might be anemic and either need a blood transfusion or iron medication to help their bones make new red 

## blood cells. If so, follow-up lab tests will usually be done in the pediatrician's office or an outpatient clinic. 

## Sleep study (pneumogram) 

## Infants with continuing apnea and bradycardia may have a special test to help determine the cause of these episodes. 

## Depending on your region of the country, the test is called a sleep study, a pneumocardiogram, or a pneumogram. 

## Philosophies vary regarding the use of pneumograms, and not all NICUs use them. A pneumogram does not answer 

## every question about the baby's apnea and bradycardia, and interpretations of the test vary regionally. The American 

## Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) states that "pneumograms are of no value in predicting sudden infant death syndrome 

## (SIDS) and are not helpful in identifying patients who should be discharged with home monitors."

## Cranial ultrasound 

### If your baby was born younger than 30 weeks' gestation, she has probably had several ultrasounds of her head to 

### detect intraventricular hemorrhage. Some NICUs will perform a cranial ultrasound or other brain imaging study near 

### the time of hospital discharge for babies weighing less than 1,000 grams at birth. Your neonatologist may also suggest 

### magnetic resonance imaging near your baby's original due date to help predict the need for early intervention 

### services and ensure the best possible developmental outcome. Sometimes a different brain imaging technique may 

### show abnormalities that a screening ultrasound will not. This does not mean that the initial ultrasounds were 

### misinterpreted, but merely that each test has limitations.
