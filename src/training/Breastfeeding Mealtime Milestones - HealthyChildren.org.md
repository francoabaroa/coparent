# Breastfeeding Mealtime Milestones 

## Breastfeeding throughout the first year includes many important mealtime milestones. Here's 

## what you can expect. 

## First Week 

## Catching On to Latching On 

## During the first week, focus on making sure your baby knows how to latch on (/English/ages

## stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Ensuring-Proper-Latch-On.aspx)correctly. This not only helps 

## avoid sore, cracked, or blistered nipples, but ensures that your body will get the message to make more milk and cause 

## your full milk supply (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Milk-Supply.aspx) to come in. 

## 2 Weeks–2 Months 

## Keeping Up With Supply and Demand 

## A lot of changes take place over the first couple of months, not the least of which will include an impressive amount of 

## growth and development, sleeping longer (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Sleeping-Through-the

## Night.aspx)stretches during the night, and settling into more of a predictable breastfeeding routine (/English/ages

## stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Establishing-a-Breastfeeding-Routine.aspx). Along with these changes, be prepared 

## for growth spurts that will inevitably result in your baby’s increased demand for more milk. 

## 4–6 Months 

## Preparing for Firsts 

## Most notably first foods (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Working-Together-Breastfeeding-and

## Solid-Foods.aspx) and first teeth (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/When-Your-Baby-Gets-Teeth.aspx), 

## that is. Rest assured that babies don’t need teeth to start solid foods, and it’s entirely possible to continue 

## breastfeeding babies comfortably even once teeth enter the picture! With the introduction of solid foods 

## recommended at about 6 months*, now’s the time to add some baby cereal (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding

## nutrition/Pages/Cereal-in-a-Bottle-Solid-Food-Shortcuts-to-Avoid.aspx) (which you’re welcome to mix with breast 

## milk) along with pureed meats, fruits, and veggies to your baby’s mealtime menu. And while some babies hold off on 

## first teeth until 9 to 12 months or even longer, this is also the time when you may start to see the first signs of front 

## teeth popping through. 

## *Note: The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breastfeeding as the sole source of nutrition for your baby 

## for about 6 months. When you add solid foods to your baby’s diet, continue breastfeeding until at least 12 months. You 

## can continue to breastfeed after 12 months if you and your baby desire. Check with your child’s doctor about vitamin 

## D and iron supplements during the first year. 

## 9 Months 

## Distracted Dining 

## Nine-month-olds are notoriously inquisitive. With a newly developing interest in the world around them, you may 

## find that your child is more easily distracted and seems more frequently disinterested in breastfeeding. Don’t let this 

## discourage you, but rather treat it as a temporary developmental bump in the road that may simply require you to 

## breastfeed in a dedicated, quieter place with fewer distractions.
