# Feeding Twins on a Schedule 

## Here is the golden rule for feeding twins: when one wakes up to eat, both must wake up to eat. 

## Your heart may break to wake up a sleeping baby, especially when she looks so cute and precious 

## lying there sleeping, but remember that you will not have enough hours in a day to feed one after 

## the other is fed, day in and day out. Once the babies are awake to eat, feed them at the same time, 

## with burp breaks throughout and a good burping session at the end. If you have a helping hand to 

## feed one twin while you feed the other, great. But if you are breastfeeding, or ever plan on being 

## alone with your twins, you’ll need to teach yourself how to feed both babies simultaneously. You 

## might as well start learning now! 

## The best way to feed both twins simultaneously is with a large twin-feeding pillow, which works for nursing and 

## bottlefeeding. It is a large U-shaped pillow with a firm foam core that fits around your waist and an opening at the 

## back. Most versions have a safety belt to latch in place so that the pillow remains snug to your body. Each twin gets his 

## or her own side and feeds in the football hold position. You will likely need help positioning the babies on the pillow in 

## the early days but you will learn how to position them by yourself with time. You will soon be very capable, handling 

## both babies safely simultaneously. If you’ve had a cesarean delivery, you may need to wait a week or so before starting 

## to use a twin-feeding pillow because the pillow’s front edge crosses your healing abdomen. In the postoperative 

## period, use bed pillows propped on both sides to nurse your twins in a double football hold position. An alternative 

## breastfeeding position has one baby in the traditional cradle hold and one baby in the football hold. 

## Positioning standard bed pillows or throw pillows for each feeding is a nuisance in the long run to get the right fit each 

## time for frequent newborn feedings. It is critical that you position yourself and the twins properly for feedings, 

## whether breastfeeding or bottle-feeding, to prevent backaches from poor posture. Hunching over for 20 minutes at a 

## time, 8 to 12 times a day, can really take its toll on your body! 

## When your twins wake up to eat, look at the clock and make a mental note of the time. Newborns often can only 

## tolerate being awake for an hour or an hour and a half at a stretch, 2 hours tops. The fact that they can only be awake 

## roughly 90 minutes at a time can help you adjust your twins to live on the same schedule. How is the time awake 

## spent? Feeding and burping will take quite some time (especially as mom and dad work on positioning the babies 

## correctly). After feeding and burping, the twins should get some time upright to help them digest their milk; this is a 

## nice time to interact and play with them. Bouncy chairs are helpful to keep one baby upright, safely buckled in, while 

## you cuddle or burp the other twin.
