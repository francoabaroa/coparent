# Tummy Time Activities 

## If your baby doesn’t tolerate tummy time—and even if she does, you are encouraged to try the 

## following activities: 

## Activity #1: Tummy to Tummy 

## It’s a good idea to begin exposing your baby to tummy time while you’re both still in the hospital 

## (/english/ages-stages/prenatal/delivery-beyond/Pages/default.aspx). The earlier you start, the 

## more likely your baby will accept the stomach as a natural position. In fact, before the umbilical 

## cord (/English/ages-stages/baby/bathing-skin-care/Pages/Umbilical-Cord-Care.aspx) has fallen 

## off, you can position your newborn on your stomach or chest while you are awake and in a reclined position on a chair, 

## bed, or floor ( with a pillow to support your head), tummy to tummy with baby. 

## Take this perfect opportunity to socialize with your newborn and encourage lots of eye contact. Talk in animated tones 

## and use exaggerated expressions to get her to look at you. It’s a special time to bond tummy to tummy. 

## Activity #2: Lap Time 

## You can also position your baby tummy down across your lap lengthwise while providing head support. Remember to 

## keep her head aligned with her body. If she falls asleep in that position, just transfer her to the bed ( but place her down 

## to sleep on her back (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/Back-to-Sleep-Tummy-to-Play.aspx)). For more 

## stimulation, slowly raise and lower your legs at the same time, then move them slowly from side to side. This motion 

## will likely calm your little one. 

## Babies need to be exposed to a variety of textures throughout the day, and tummy time is the perfect opportunity to 

## accomplish this. When your baby is on her tummy, the skin on her stomach, legs, arms, and face touches the surface 

## on which she is lying. The most natural place to play is on a clean floor, a nap mat, or blankets of different textures. 

## ( Note: Blankets should be secured so they don’t slide around when baby moves her arms or legs.) As she moves her 

## body, arms, and legs against the surface, the friction that is created lets her know where her body is located in space. 

## Additionally, your baby will gain strength and flexibility during tummy time. Dressing your little one in an infant body 

## suit (eg, Onesie (/English/ages-stages/baby/diapers-clothing/Pages/Dressing-Your-Newborn.aspx)) for tummy time 

## allows her to feel the various textures on her arms and legs. 

## Tummy time also allows your baby to visually explore the environment in a new way. When positioned on her back, 

## she can see only the ceiling and whatever is directly around her. But on her stomach, she uses her muscles to lift her 

## head and see the world at eye level, giving her a completely different view of the world—a new perspective! 

## An Important Reminder 

## Once your baby starts participating in tummy time, be sure to provide supervision. In this world of distractions, your 

## phone will ring or you’ll get called to another room, but stay with your baby because the AAP recommends that 

## tummy time be supervised. 

## Babies with Special Health Care Needs 

## If your baby was born premature (/english/ages-stages/baby/preemie/Pages/default.aspx) or has reflux disease 

## (/English/health-issues/conditions/abdominal/Pages/GERD-Reflux.aspx) or special needs, speak with your child’s 

## pediatrician about tummy time. Some babies need special consideration. 

## Activity #3: Side Lying With Support 

## Side lying is a great alternative to tummy time if your baby doesn’t tolerate being on her stomach. Place your baby on 

## a blanket on her side; if needed, prop her back against a rolled-up towel for support. If her head needs support, place a 

## small, folded washcloth under her head. Both of baby’s arms should be in front of her, and you should bring her legs 

## forward at the hips and bend her knees to make her comfortable.

## Don’t forget to distract your baby with a fun toy or read her an entertaining book while she’s in this position. It is best 

## to set up a regular time for tummy time and side lying, such as after naps, baths, or diaper changes. Just be sure to have 

## a plan in place and take care to vary your baby’s position every 10 to 15 minutes during playtime 

## Strive to expose your baby to a variety of positions throughout the day, including time spent in your arms and on your 

## lap. Remember, babies crave emotional interaction and connection with their parents.
