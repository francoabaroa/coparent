# Stuttering in Toddlers & Preschoolers: What’s Typical, 

# What’s Not? 

## As toddlers and preschoolers become increasingly verbal, they may 

## begin to stumble over their words—raising concerns about 

## stuttering. As a parent, how do you know when disfluencies are a 

## normal part of development and when to be more concerned? Read 

## on. 

## What are Typical Disfluencies? 

## It is not uncommon for young children to have disfluencies in their 

## speech (e.g., word or phrase repetitions). In fact, about 5% of all 

## children are likely to be disfluent at some point in their 

## development, usually between ages 2 ½ and 5. It is also very typical 

## for a child to go back and forth between periods of fluency and disfluency. Sometimes, this can occur for no apparent 

## reason, but often this happens when a child is excited, tired, or feels rushed to speak. 

## Learning language rules: 

## During this time, children are expanding their vocabularies rapidly and learning complex language rules. These rules 

## allow children to change simple messages ("Mommy juice") into longer, more complicated sentences that require 

## more motor coordination to produce smoothly ("Mommy put the juice in the blue cup"). It's only natural that there 

## may be some disruptions along the way. 

## Is It Truly Stuttering? 

## For most toddlers and preschoolers, most disfluencies go away on their own after a short period of time. In other 

## cases, disfluencies persist and the signs of stuttering become more obvious. Getting professional help early offers the 

## best chances for reducing stuttering. But how can parents tell the difference between typical disfluency that will 

## go away and the early signs of non-typical disfluencies that may indicate stuttering? 

## Here are some ways to differentiate typical disfluency from stuttering: 


### If your child is truly stuttering, he or she may hold out the first sound in a word, saying "Ssssssssometimes we stay 

### home," or repeat the sound, as in "Look at the b-b-b-baby!" In addition, children who stutter often develop other 

#### mannerisms such as eye blinking, tense mouth, looking to the side, and avoiding eye contact. 

## Risk Factors for Stuttering: 

#### There are other risk factors that can help predict whether fluency problems will continue for longer than a few 

#### months. 

#### Family history is the biggest predictor of whether a child is likely to stutter. 

#### Gender. Young boys are twice as likely as young girls to stutter, and elementary school-age boys are 3 to 4 times 

#### more likely to stutter than girls. 

#### Age of onset. Children that start having difficulties at age 4 are more likely to have a persistent stutter than those 

#### who begin stuttering at a younger age. 

#### Co-existing speech and/or language disorders increase the likelihood a child may stutter. 

## Getting Help: 

#### If you are concerned about your child's speech, talk with your pediatrician about getting a speech and language 

#### evaluation. A complete evaluation from a certified speech-language pathologist can help you to better determine if 

#### the stuttering is likely to persist. 

#### Speech-language pathologists will help parents determine the best course of action (e.g., closely monitoring the 

#### child's fluency, enrolling in treatment services, and/or parent education). The American Speech-Language-Hearing 

#### Association (ASHA) offers a searchable database (http://www.asha.org/profind/) of these professionals. In addition, a 

#### list of clinicians who specialize in stuttering can be found here 

#### (http://www.stutteringspecialists.org/search/custom.asp?id=1972). 

## Treatment Approaches for Stuttering: 

#### Early treatment for stuttering is very important, as it is more likely to be eliminated when a child is young (before 

#### entering elementary school). There are two main treatment approaches for stuttering: 

#### Indirect treatment is when the speech-language pathologist helps the child's parents on how to modify their 

#### own communication styles. Indirect approaches are effective at reducing or even eliminating stuttering in many 

#### young children. 

#### Direct treatment involves the speech-language pathologist working with the children themselves either one

#### on-one or in small groups, giving them specific speech strategies for easing into words and reducing tension 

#### during stuttering events. In addition, direct treatment may involve helping the child to differentiate between 

#### smooth (fluent) and bumpy (stuttered) speech. 

#### After age 7, it becomes unlikely that stuttering will go away completely. Still, after age 7, treatment can be very 

#### effective at helping a child effectively manage stuttering—helping develop skills necessary to handle difficult 

#### situations (e.g., teasing and bullying) and participate fully in school and activities. For older children, speech treatment 

#### is still beneficial, encouraged, and effective in helping to reduce the severity and impact of stuttering. 

## What Parents Can Do: 

#### Here are some ways parents can help: 

#### Reduce communication stress. There are different techniques to put less pressure on a child in a speaking 

### situation. Rephrasing questions as comments (using " You played outside today at school. It must have been fun!" 

### instead of "What did you do at school?") is one effective approach. Parents can also do their best to reduce 

#### situations that trigger their child's stuttering. 

#### Talk about it. When children are aware of their stuttering, it is best to be open and talk about it in a positive way. 

#### Let them know it is okay to have "bumpy speech." If a child does not seem to be aware of the problem, there is no 

#### need to bring it up until you are seeing a speech-language pathologist.

#### Practice patience. Give children time to finish what they are saying. Don't rush or interrupt them. Don't tell 

### them to "slow down" or "think about what you want to say." Phrases such as those are generally not helpful to 

#### children who stutter. 

#### Model good speech habits. While telling a child how to talk is generally not helpful, parents can model speech 

#### habits that help with stuttering, such as slowing down their own speed when they talk, putting in more pauses 

#### between sentences, and speaking in a relaxed manner. 

#### Seek a professional. There are many ways to find a speech-language pathologist. A child's pediatrician can 

#### provide a recommendation. Children younger than 3 can receive a free evaluation through their local Early 

#### Intervention Program (http://ectacenter.org/families.asp). If a child is older than 3, parents can contact their local 

#### public school for a free evaluation. Parents also have the option to seek out a private speech-language pathologist 

#### with a child at any age. A searchable database of these professionals is available here 

#### (http://www.asha.org/profind/). A list of stuttering specialists is available here 

#### (http://www.stutteringspecialists.org/search/custom.asp?id=1972). 

## Follow Your Instincts: 

#### If you continue to have concerns about your child's speech, ask for a reevaluation or referral for additional formal 

#### testing.
