# Tips for Freezing & Refrigerating Breast Milk 

## By: Dina DiMaggio, MD, FAAP 

## When it comes to breast milk, how you store it depends 

## on how soon you want to use it. 

## Here are some helpful 

## guidelines for storing your 

## breast milk safely. 

## Before expressing or pumping: Wash your 

## hands and all storage containers thoroughly. Label the date the breast milk was expressed on each container and 

## include your child's name if you are giving the milk to a child care provider. Talk with your child care provider 

## about how they require breast milk be stored and labeled. 

## Store breast milk in small batches. 2 to 4 ounces is recommended to prevent waste. Any remaining breast milk 

## left in a bottle after your baby is finished with a feeding should be used within 2 hours, or, if quickly refrigerated, 

## used for the next feeding. You can always thaw an extra container if needed. 

## Refrigerate or chill milk right after it is expressed. Freshly expressed milk can remain at room temperature 

## (up to 77°F or 25°C) for 4 hours (or up to 6 to 8 hours if very cleanly expressed), but it is best to chill as soon as 

## possible. 

## Breast milk can be placed in the back of the refrigerator (39°F or 4°C). It is best to use refrigerated breast milk 

## within 4 days, but it can be refrigerated for up to 8 days. 

## To warm breast milk from the refrigerator: Place the bottle in a bowl of warm water or run it under warm 

## water. Microwaving breast milk is not safe due to the risk of scalding your baby with hot milk. 

## Freeze breast milk if you will not be using it within 24 hours. Breast milk expands as it freezes, so do not fill 

## the milk all the way to the top of the storage container. Again store the milk in the back of the freezer, not the 

## door. 

## If freezing the milk inside a refrigerator with a freezer that has a separate door (0°F or −18°C), milk may be 

## frozen for up to 9 months. 

## If the freezer is a chest or a deep freezer (−4°F or −20°C), milk may be frozen for up to 12 months. 

## To thaw breast milk from the freezer: Put the bottle or bag in the refrigerator overnight, hold it under warm 

## running water, or set it in a container of warm water. Remember that heating breast milk in microwaves is not 

## safe. 

## Once breast milk is thawed: It can be stored in a refrigerator and must be used within 24 hours. 


## The Rule of 4's 

#### We know breast milk storage can be confusing, so here is a more conservative approach that you can also go by (and 

### easily remember): 4 hours at room temperature and 4 days in the refrigerator! 

### Editor's Note: Although these breast milk storage guidelines are appropriate for babies born premature and those 

### who are hospitalized, hospitals may have their own rules. If you have specific questions, discuss these guidelines with 

### your baby's pediatrician and/or hospital. 

## Where We Stand: 

#### The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breastfeeding as the sole source of nutrition for your baby for 

#### about 6 months. When you add solid foods (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Working-Together

#### Breastfeeding-and-Solid-Foods.aspx) to your baby's diet, continue breastfeeding until at least 12 months. You can 

#### continue to breastfeed after 12 months if you and your baby desire.
