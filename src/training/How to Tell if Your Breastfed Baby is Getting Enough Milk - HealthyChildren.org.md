# How to Tell if Your Breastfed Baby is Getting Enough Milk 

## Nearly all new parents worry about whether their 

## babies are properly nourished. If you're breastfeeding, 

## you can't measure exactly how much milk your 

## newborn is taking. However, there are other ways to tell 

## if your baby is getting enough to eat. 

## Here are a half dozen signs of a well-fed newborn that 

## can put your mind to ease. 

## 6 signs your nursing newborn is 

## well nourished 

## How fast babies gain weight, how many wet and dirty diapers they have, and how long they seem satisfied after 

## nursing are good clues. A well nourished newborn should: 

## Lose no more than 7% of birthweight in the first few days after birth before starting to gain weight again. 

## Have one or two bowel movements per day on days one and two, with blackish, tarry stools (/English/ages

## stages/baby/Pages/Pooping-By-the-Numbers.aspx), and at least two stools that are beginning to appear greenish 

## to yellow on days three and four. 

## By five to seven days, your baby's stools should be yellow and loose, with small curds, and should number at least 

## three to four per day. When your milk production increases, your baby will often produce stool with each feeding 

## for the first month of life. 

## Have six or more wet diapers (/English/ages-stages/baby/diapers-clothing/Pages/default.aspx) per day, with 

## nearly colorless or pale yellow urine, by five to seven days. 

## Seem satisfied and happy for an average of one to three hours between feedings (/English/ages

## stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/how-often-and-how-much-should-your-baby-eat.aspx). 

## Nurse at least eight to twelve times every twenty-four hours. 

## Remember 

## Schedule your newborn's first checkup with the pediatrician or family physician no more than forty-eight hours after 

## hospital discharge. The weight check at that visit will help to know if your baby is getting enough milk from feedings.
