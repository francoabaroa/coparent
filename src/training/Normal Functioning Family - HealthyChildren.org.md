# Normal Functioning Family 

## Is there any way to tell if my family is functioning normally? 

## Many parents ask themselves this question, but there is no simple answer, since there can be such broad definitions of 

## the term normal. 

## Still, there are several characteristics that are generally identified with a well-functioning family. Some include: 

## support; love and caring for other family members; providing security and a sense of belonging; open 

## communication; making each person within the family feel important, valued, respected and esteemed. 

## Here are some other qualities to consider when evaluating how well your own family is functioning. 

## Is there ample humor and fun within your family, despite the very real demands of daily life? 

## Does your family have rules that have been clearly stated and are evenly applied, yet are flexible and respond to 

## new situations and changes in the family? 

## Are the family's expectations of each person reasonable, realistic, mutually agreed upon and generally fulfilled? 

## Do family members achieve most of their individual goals, and are their personal needs being met? 

## Do parents and children have genuine respect for one another, demonstrating love, caring, trust, and concern, 

## even when there are disagreements? 

## Is your family able to mature and change without everyone getting upset or unhappy? 

## Maintaining A Healthy Family 

## In order to provide a supportive, emotionally healthy family environment, you need to devote some thought and 

## energy to the following questions: 

## Do you treat each child as an individual? Each child has his own temperament, his own way of viewing and 

## interacting with the world around him. Parents may love their children equally, but naturally will have different 

## sorts of relationships with each of them. Individualize your relationship with each of your children, reinforcing 

## their strengths and talents and avoiding making unflattering comparisons with their siblings or friends. 

## Does your family have regular routines? Children and parents benefit from having some predictable day-to

## day routines. Morning schedules, mealtimes and bedtimes are easier for everyone when they follow a pattern. 

## Children also appreciate family rituals and traditions around birthdays, holidays and vacations. 

## Is your family an active participant in your extended family and the community? Families work better 

## when they feel connected and supported by friends and relatives. Usually such relationships require that parents 

## make an active effort to get together with others socially or for civic projects. 

## Are your expectations of yourself and other family members realistic? Your child's self-awareness, 

## knowledge and skills are constantly changing. Observe, read and talk to others to learn what can reasonably be 

## expected of your child at each stage of development. Parents, too, have limitations on what they can accomplish, 

## given their resources and the time available. There are no "superparents," just individuals doing their best. 

## Does the time you spend with your family members contribute to good relationships among you? Most of 

## the time you and your child and your spouse spend together should be fun, relaxed, meaningful and relatively 

## conflict-free. 

## As a parent, singly or as a couple, are you taking care of your own needs? You should be leading a healthy 

## personal life (including proper diet, exercise and sleep habits). Set aside time, however brief, for things you enjoy. 

## Your children will thrive when your own emotional needs are being met. They do best when they are reared by 

## parents who are in a harmonious relationship with each other. 

## Do you take moral and social responsibility for your own life? You are the most important role model for 

## your child. Demonstrate your value system through actions as well as words.
