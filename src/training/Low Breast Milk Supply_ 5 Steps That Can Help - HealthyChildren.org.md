# Low Breast Milk Supply: 5 Steps That Can Help 

## By: Hailey Nelson, MD, FAAP, IBCLC 

## Navigating concerns for low breast milk supply can be a 

## lot of stress for some families. This may be even more 

## so during the baby formula shortage (/English/tips

## tools/ask-the-pediatrician/Pages/Are-there-shortages

## of-infant-formula-due-to-COVID-19.aspx) if you need to 

## supplement with formula. Here are five steps that can 

## help if you're looking to boost your milk supply, 

## whether you are exclusively nursing your infant or 

## supplementing with formula or solid foods 

## (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding

## nutrition/Pages/Starting-Solid-Foods.aspx). 

## 1. Visit your child's health care provider. 

## All mothers share the concern about their milk being enough for their baby. If you are worried about breast milk 

## supply, visit your child's pediatrician—we are happy to help! Your pediatrician will start by looking at how your infant 

## is growing. A baby who is tracking along their growth curve (/English/health-issues/conditions/Glands-Growth

## Disorders/Pages/Growth-Charts-By-the-Numbers.aspx) as they should is very reassuring. 

## Sometimes babies are fussy due to colic (/English/ages-stages/baby/crying-colic/Pages/Colic.aspx) or other factors, 

## which may not be related to the volume or amount of feeding. Pediatricians can also work with you to identify factors 

## that can help increase your breast milk supply or resolve breastfeeding difficulties, including latching issues 

## (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/ensuring-proper-latch-on.aspx) and breastfeeding positions 

## (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Positioning-Your-Baby-For-Breastfeeding.aspx). An evaluation by a 

## board-certified lactation consultant can also help you discover any other possible causes of low breast milk supply. 

## In addition, your pediatrician may also be able to connect you with resources if you are struggling to find baby 

## formula (/English/tips-tools/ask-the-pediatrician/Pages/Are-there-shortages-of-infant-formula-due-to-COVID

## 19.aspx) for your infant. 

## 2. Tech check your breast pump. 

## Effective milk extraction is the best way to help keep up your milk supply. If you are pumping and notice that there is a 

## decrease in the volume you are able to produce, check your pump equipment (/English/ages

## stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/How-to-Clean-Your-Breast-Pump.aspx). Ensuring a proper flange fit can optimize 

## pumping. It is also a good idea to inspect the pump valves. Over time, they can become worn and reduce the 

## effectiveness of your pump. 

## For information about pump settings, you can look to your pump's manufacturer. Some even have help lines you can 

## call to troubleshoot pump-setting issues. However, it is best to seek the help of a lactation consultant to determine 

## which pump settings work best for you. 

## Also, consider if the type of pump you're using is best for your specific needs. A double electric pump is best when 

## needing to express breastmilk. Manual or hand pumps can work for short-term use, but are not ideal when you are 

## planning to return to work (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Returning-to-Work.aspx) outside the 

## home or pump longer term. If you do not have an electric pump, your insurance may be able to cover it. Talk with your 

## pediatrician or a lactation consultant to learn more. 

## 3. If you are supplementing with formula, offer breast milk first. 

## If you are supplementing your breast-fed baby's diet with formula, start feedings with available breast milk first. Then 

## if needed, give baby formula to meet your infant's growing nutritional demands. Be sure to follow food safety 

## guidelines for breast milk (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Storing-and-Preparing-Expressed-Breast

#### with-Water.aspx). If either are left out to long, especially once a bottle has been used, they can be contaminated with 

#### oral bacteria and make your infant sick. 

### 4. Take time to care for you. 

#### Staying hydrated and getting good nutrition are very important to breast milk production. You need to take care 

#### (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/Pages/Finding-a-Self-Care-Ritual-That-Works-for-You.aspx) and nourish 

#### yourself so you can provide nutrition to your baby. There are no special tricks or products needed; specific foods or 

#### supplements you may see marketed to promote breastmilk production are not necessary. Instead, focus on eating 

#### healthful foods and drinking plenty of water! 

#### Be mindful, too, of your own stress level. The formula shortage can be incredibly anxiety-inducing for parents, 

#### especially when they are already managing the challenge of being a new parent. During this time, be extra mindful of 

#### your stress level and get enough sleep and physical activity to keep your mind and body healthy. 

### 5. Consider other health factors. 

#### If you've noticed a lower-than-usual milk supply, consider other health factors. For example, the return of your cycle 

#### or thyroid issues can affect breast milk supply. Infections can also affect your ability to make breast milk. Some other 

#### factors that could increase the risk of low milk: your baby was born pre-term: you had a cesarian delivery or difficult 

#### delivery; you delivered multiples, or you had a previous breast biopsy or surgery. Consider seeing your primary care 

#### provider or OB/GYN for further evaluation if you have any health concerns. 

## Remember 

#### As the old saying goes, "It takes a village." So, reach out to your village for connection and support. If you are running 

#### low on formula your baby needs, for example, ask friends and family to keep an eye out for it when they go grocery 

#### shopping. And don't hesitate to reach out to your pediatrician with any health or feeding concerns. Working together 

#### and helping each other can help ensure your baby gets the nutrition they need until formula production ramps back 

#### up and/or your breastmilk supply is meeting their growing needs.
