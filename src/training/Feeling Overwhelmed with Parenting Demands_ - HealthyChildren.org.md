# Feeling Overwhelmed with Parenting Demands? 

## Are you stressed by the demands of raising 

## children―helping with homework, handling the 

## logistics of after-school activities, sports, doctor's 

## appointments, birthday parties? When you became a 

## parent, was being overwhelmed part of the job 

## description? 

## If you'd like to take a step 

## back―if you are feeling maxed 

## out―but don't know what to do, 

## read on. 

## Here are some strategies to help you build resilience. (And no, they don't involve spending lots of money). These 

## opportunities focus on what you can do right now at home. Right now, in your neighborhood. Give yourself 

## permission to reduce your stress and be happy―in whatever ways work best for you. 

## 1. Change your perspective. 

## People sometimes experience anxiety after letting their worries take over. Are you releasing your tensions in 

## unhealthy ways? 

## Break down big problems into smaller parts. This means tackling challenges head on yet doing so one at a 

## time. This is often called compartmentalizing. Imagine putting each cause of stress inside separate plastic 

## containers. Now visualize closing the lids. Segmenting challenges decreases stress because it spurs the 

## realization problems can be dealt with individually, while the rest can be "stored" for another time. Watch this 

## video to learn more (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozRPhZRd-fA). 

## Know how much power (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18399953) you give to each stressor in your 

## life. Sometimes stress comes from real danger, but in most cases, the amount of stress we feel has more to do 

## with how we think about the obstacles in our way. Take an accounting of how much influence you are giving to 

## each challenge you are facing. 

## Reach out to others for help. 

## This is not a sign of weakness―in fact it is the opposite. Licensed and certified psychologists 

## (https://locator.apa.org/), social workers, and other mental health professionals can offer support and suggestions 

## for big and small setbacks. A trusted pastor, rabbi, imam or other religious figure can help you with some faith-based 

## strategies (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24320650), as well. 

## If you are looking for help for yourself or someone else, you may be tempted to call someone who advertises in a 

## local publication or who comes up from a search of the Internet. While you may, or may not, find a competent 

## therapist in this manner, it is wise to check on credentials. Competent therapists hold advanced academic degrees 

## and are trained in techniques for treating anger management. They should always be licensed to practice in your 

## state. 

## Look for therapists affiliated with local universities or mental health facilities. You can also check membership 

## listings on the websites of professional organizations, such as the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive 

## Therapies (http://www.findcbt.org/FAT/) or the American Psychological Association (https://locator.apa.org/?

### Ask yourself these key questions whenever a challenge pops up: 

###### Is this a real tiger or paper tiger? (Yes, a tiger!) Remember, humans are built to successfully flee ferocious 

###### carnivores. Our internal stress response launches us into survival mode―a period during which it's nearly 

###### impossible to think clearly. You'll solve problems more effectively if you are able to recognize most problems 

###### don't represent immediate danger. Once you recognize that, you'll be able to more effectively calm your thinking 

###### and determine what you need to do next. 

##### How will I feel about this problem tomorrow? Next week? Next year? Do you know the musical, Annie, and 

##### its famous song, "Tomorrow?" This show-stopping tune reminds us that our struggles nearly always ease with the 

##### passage of time. "The sun will come up tomorrow;" a good reminder when trying to keep things in perspective. 

###### Is this "good" situation permanent? OK, maybe this is a bit glass half empty. But sometimes―without meaning 

###### to think self-defeating thoughts —we do. We get nervous we're unworthy of success. In the worse cases, we 

###### might even sabotage our good fortune. Don't do this to yourself! Come to appreciate all the wonderful events in 

###### your life. You've earned it. 

## 2. Give yourself a safe space to express feelings. 

###### Writing―in any form―is a powerful way to lower stress and develop a more resilient mindset. 

### Why writing your thoughts and feelings is so good for your health: 

###### Writing allows you to let go of controlling emotions. Once they're on the page, our thoughts and feelings are 

###### no longer at the forefront of our minds. We're able to worry less by writing more. 

###### Writing alters memories of stressful events. Research 

###### (https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/15b8/bc129008e7aafffbf79b7ead6f868d76e4ad.pdf) shows writing about 

###### stressful experiences, for example, has improved the health of many different people. Putting pen to paper has 

###### been proven to not only decrease stressful memories but improve 

###### (http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/189437) how people cope with them. This is why reviewing 

###### your old writing, for example, can be a great way to reflect on the lessons you've learned along the way. 

###### Remember: You don't need to write every day. Writing can simply be a tool whenever you need to release 

###### tension or make sense of an emotion. Writing―in any form―shouldn't add stress to your life! Write for yourself, 

###### not for others. 

## 3. Give back. It feels good to give. 

##### The ultimate act of resilience―to make yourself feel stronger―is to reach out to other people when they need 

##### support. (Read that line again—it can be lifesaving!) When we give, we learn it feels good to help. We're then more 

###### likely to accept support when we need it. 

### Helping others also helps us in these essential ways: 

###### It boosts our well-being. It's been studied! (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18198690) When we 

###### volunteer, we put aside our troubles and gain perspective. Perhaps, we determine our difficulties aren't so bad 

###### after all. Giving back also comes with a welcome reminder: You matter, and you are valued. 

###### It gives more opportunities for family time or solo time. Volunteer solo or with your family. From local food 

###### pantries, to religious institutions, to your son or daughter's school, the opportunities to volunteer are everywhere 

###### (https://parentandteen.com/volunteering/). Some people even manage to turn the act of volunteering into a 

###### family vacation. 

## 4. Practice what you preach. 

##### Think about working on some challenging homework with your kids. How often do you hear them say, "I can't?" As 

##### parents, we can correct this self-defeating language with "You can. Let's work on it."

### How you can be a model for your children: 

#### Modeling Self-CareModeling Self-Care 

###### Add in "yet" to the end of your own self-defeating thoughts. When so many of our own thoughts begin with 

##### words like "I never" or "I can't," we close the door for progress. We undermine hope. Just like you do for your kids, 

##### work to add the transformative word "yet" to the end of your thoughts. "I can't solve this problem" becomes "I can't 

##### solve this problem YET." Hope and possibility are are then restored with one simple word. 

## Yet, another upside to taking care of yourself. 

###### Taking advantage of these techniques has a wonderful, unexpected upside: by controlling how you handle stress, you 

###### model how best to manage challenges for your children. And that will no doubt help them build a more resilient 

###### mindset, too.
