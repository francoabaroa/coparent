# Language Development: 8 to 12 Months 

## Toward the end of the first year, your baby will begin to communicate what she wants by pointing, 

## crawling, or gesturing toward her target. She’ll also imitate many of the gestures she sees adults 

## make as they talk. This nonverbal communication is only a temporary measure, however, while 

## she learns how to phrase her messages in words. 

## Do you notice the coos, gurgles, and screeches of earlier months now giving way to recognizable 

## syllables, such as “ba,” “da,” “ga,” and “ma”? Your child may even stumble on words such as 

## “mama” and “bye-bye” quite accidentally, and when you get excited she’ll realize she’s said 

## something meaningful. Before long she’ll start using “mama” to summon you or attract your 

## attention. At this age, she may also say “mama” throughout the day just to practice saying the word. Ultimately, 

## however, she’ll use words only when she wants to communicate their meanings. 

## Even though you’ve been talking to your baby from birth, she now understands more language, and thus your 

## conversations will take on new significance. Before she can say many, if any, words, she’ll probably be comprehending 

## more than you suspect. For example, watch how she responds when you mention a favorite toy across the room. If she 

## looks toward it, she’s telling you she understands. To help her increase her understanding, keep talking to her as 

## much as possible. Tell her what’s happening around her, particularly as you bathe, change, and feed her. Make your 

## language simple and specific: “I’m drying you with the big blue towel. How soft it feels!” Verbally label familiar toys 

## and objects for her, and try to be as consistent as possible— that is, if you call the family pet a cat today, don’t call it a 

## kitty tomorrow. 

## Picture books can enhance this entire process by reinforcing her budding understanding that everything has a name. 

## Choose books with large board, cloth, or vinyl pages that she can turn herself. Also look for simple but colorful 

## illustrations of things your child will recognize. 

## Whether you’re reading or talking to her, give her plenty of opportunities to join in. Ask questions and wait for a 

## response. Or let her take the lead. If she says “Gaagaagaa,” repeat it back and see what she does. Yes, these exchanges 

## may seem meaningless, but they tell your baby that communication is two-way and that she’s a welcome participant. 

## Paying attention to what she says also will help you identify the words she understands and make it more likely that 

## you’ll recognize her first spoken words. 

## These first words, incidentally, often aren’t proper English. For your child, a “word” is any sound that consistently 

## refers to the same person, object, or event. So if she says “mog” every time she wants milk, you should treat “mog” 

## with all the respect of a legitimate word. When you speak back to her, however, use “milk,” and eventually she’ll make 

## the correction herself. 

## There’s a tremendous variance in the age at which children begin to say recognizable words. Some have a vocabulary 

## of two to three words by their first birthday. More likely, your baby’s speech at twelve months will consist of a sort of 

## gibberish that has the tones and variations of intelligible speech. As long as she’s experimenting with sounds that vary 

## in intensity, pitch, and quality, she’s getting ready to talk. The more you respond to her as if she were speaking, the 

## more you’ll stimulate her urge to communicate.
