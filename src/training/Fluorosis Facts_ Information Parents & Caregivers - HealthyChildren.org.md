# Fluorosis Facts: Information Parents & Caregivers 

## Fluoride (/English/healthy-living/oral-health/Pages/FAQ-Fluoride-and-Children.aspx) is an 

## important mineral for all children. Our mouths contain bacteria that combine with sugars in the 

## foods we eat and the beverages we drink. The acid that is produced harms tooth enamel and 

## damages teeth. Fluoride protects the teeth and can even help reverse early signs of decay 

## (/English/healthy-living/oral-health/Pages/Preventing-Tooth-Decay-in-Children.aspx). But the 

## increased availability of fluoride today has resulted in more of something called dental fluorosis. 

## What is Dental Fluorosis? 

## Dental fluorosis is a change in the appearance of the tooth's enamel surface. The most 

## common types do not affect the function of the tooth and don't cause pain. 

## Most dental fluorosis is either very mild or mild. Mild forms of fluorosis appear as white, 

## lacy markings on the tooth's enamel and are difficult to see with the untrained eye. 

## Fewer instances of fluorosis are categorized as moderate. Moderate fluorosis looks just like 

## mild but covers more of the tooth. 

## In rare cases, fluorosis is described as severe. When fluorosis is severe, the enamel may 

## have pitting and brown spots. 

## What Causes Dental Fluorosis? 

## Dental fluorosis is caused by consuming too much fluoride over the period of time when teeth are forming but before 

## they appear in the mouth. This takes place before 8 years of age. To avoid this possibility, supervise brushing so that 

## children do not use too much toothpaste, mouthwash, or mouthrinse and learn to spit, not swallow. 

## How Much Fluoride Should My Child Have to Protect His Teeth 

## Without the Risk of Fluorosis? 

## Children who consume a typical diet, drink fluoridated water (/English/healthy-living/oral-health/Pages/Water

## Fluoridation.aspx), and use fluoridated dental products properly will get the fluoride they need for healthy teeth. It is 

## not necessary to monitor water or food consumption since your child ingests low levels of fluoride from these 

## sources. Parents will want to ensure that children do not swallow toothpaste or mouthrinse, which contain more 

## concentrated amounts of this important mineral. 

## How Do I Know if My Child Has Dental Fluorosis? 

## Since there are many possible causes of changes in the appearance of the teeth, you may want to see a dental 

## professional to have the teeth checked for fluorosis or other issues. The American Academy of Pediatrics 

## recommends that all children begin regular visits to the dentist by their first birthday. Ask your pediatrician's office if 

## they offer referrals. 

## Sources of Fluoride 

## Beverages, including fluoridated tap water 

## Foods processed with fluoridated water 

## Toothpaste and other oral care products 

## Topical fluoride & dietary supplements 


## How Do I Protect My Child's Teeth without Causing Fluorosis? 

### Here are three things you can do: 

#### 1. Follow these guidelines on the proper use of dental products such as toothpaste (/English/healthy

#### living/oral-health/Pages/Toothbrushing-Tips-for-Young-Children.aspx). Children under the age of 6 should avoid 

#### the use of mouthwash and mouthrinse. 

#### Children younger than age 3 should use a "smear" of toothpaste containing fluoride. 

#### Limit tooth brushing to 2 times a day for this age group. 

#### Children aged 3-6 years should use a slightly larger, "pea-sized" amount of toothpaste 

#### containing fluoride. 

#### Supervise and help young children with tooth brushing. Since most young children 

#### will instinctively swallow water, they should be encouraged to spit out excess toothpaste, but not rinse with water. 

#### Keep all dental products out of the reach of young children to avoid accidental ingestion. 

#### 2. Determine whether your primary source of water is fluoridated. 

#### For information on local water systems see the CDC My Water's Fluoride 

#### (http://apps.nccd.cdc.gov/MWF/Index.asp). 

#### For information on well water, see Private Well Water & Fluoride 

#### (http://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/faqs/wellwater.htm). 

#### Most bottled water in the U.S. does not contain an optimal level of fluoride. 

#### If your water is not fluoridated, speak to your child's doctor or dentist about ways to ensure your family is getting 

#### enough fluoride from other sources. 

#### 3. Start regular visits to the dentist by your child's first birthday. If you do not have a dentist yet, your child's 

#### doctor can refer you to a dental home. He can also check her teeth, talk to you about taking care of her oral 

#### health, and make sure she is getting enough fluoride. 

## What about Infant Formula? 

#### According to the American Dental Association, it is safe to mix infant formula (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding

#### nutrition/Pages/How-to-Safely-Prepare-Formula-with-Water.aspx) with fluoridated water. 

## Not All Sugars are Sweet! 

#### Starchy foods, including snacks kids like such as pretzels, crackers, and chips, contain sugars, and sugar contributes to 

#### tooth decay! 

#### Limit sweet and salty snacks (/English/healthy-living/oral-health/Pages/Diet-Tips-to-Prevent-Dental-Problems.aspx), 

#### and offer water instead of sweetened beverages like soda pop and juice.
