# Glamorizing Addiction: The Problem with Smoking in 

# Movies 

## Tobacco companies spend millions on marketing and advertising. 

## The current trend is to put tobacco imagery into movies, TV, and 

## other media to promote tobacco use and glamorize addiction. 

## Tobacco control organizations have recognized this, and have been 

## advocating for the elimination of tobacco from movies, TV, and 

## other media images that may be seen by children. 

## Why should movies be smoke free? 

## Children are impressionable, and often imitate what they see. 

## Smoking in the movies accounts for 37% of all smoking initiation. 

## The 2014 Surgeon General's Report 

## (https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/50th-anniversary/) found that actions that would eliminate the 

## depiction of tobacco use in movies, which are produced and rated as appropriate for children and adolescents, could 

## have a significant effect on preventing youth from becoming tobacco users. 

## So, why is smoking still in movies? 

## Many movies contain tobacco imagery, even though it may not add anything to the movie itself. This is due to the 

## influence and funding from tobacco companies. 

## Fast facts: 

## In 2016, 26% of all youth-rated movies (G, PG, PG-13) contained tobacco impressions. 

## There were 809 tobacco incidents (single use or implied use of a tobacco product, usually smoking) in top

## grossing PG-13 movies in 2016. This is an increase of 43% since 2010. 

## According to CDC data (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6626a1.htm), the rate of tobacco 

## incidents in youth-rated movies declined steadily from 2005-2010, but that decline stopped in 2010. 

## What does the research show? 

## There is a lot of research that shows the link between smoking in TV or movies and in children, which has caused a lot 

## of action to combat this issue. See the fact sheet, Smoke-free Movies: Top Numbers 

## (/SiteCollectionDocuments/SFMhandout.pdf) , for more information.

## What can be done? 

#### The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and several collaborating organizations encourage an R rating 

#### (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/Movie-Ratings-and-What-They-Mean.aspx) for movies containing tobacco 

#### imagery—unless it depicts the consequences of tobacco use or depicts historically accurate tobacco use)—and that 

#### studios certify in the movie credits that no one associated with the film received any sort of compensation for 

#### including tobacco imagery in the production. 

#### The World Health Organization (WHO) released a report 

#### (http://www.who.int/tobacco/smoke_free_movies/en/) calling for enforceable policies to restrict smoking in movies. 

#### Other ways to help combat this problem: 

#### To stop using brand identifiers in films that include tobacco imagery (i.e., a clearly-marked cigarette package) 

#### To not offer public subsidies for movies featuring tobacco imagery 

#### To include strong antitobacco ads that run prior to the start of a film that includes tobacco imagery 

### Well, parents can't do anything about this... right? 

#### WRONG. Parents can have a big impact! The Smoke Free Movies (http://smokefreemovies.ucsf.edu/take

#### action/community) project, based out of the University of California at San Francisco, offers ideas on how to 

#### effectively take action—starting at home (http://smokefreemovies.ucsf.edu/take-action/community).
