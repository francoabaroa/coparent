# A Dozen Fun Family Rituals 

## 1. Family video night. Rent a movie, order in a pizza, make popcorn. The only difficulty may 

## be agreeing on something the whole family wants to watch (and is appropriate for teens and 

## younger children). Again, alternate choices among family members. 

## 2. After a big snowstorm, everybody tramp outside to build a snowman or go for a walk 

## together. Then shovel. 

## 3. Sharing the Sunday newspaper over a special breakfast. This is a ritual with Mom and 

## Dad in mind. Or what about all going out to a restaurant for brunch? 

## 4. Buy a special dessert to transform dinner into an occasion, and not just on birthdays, 

## wedding anniversaries and graduations. Celebrate family members’ achievements. An 

## unexpected high grade on a test at school or a promotion at work deserves a cake—with candles and an 

## inscription. Be creative! 

## 5. Spiritual pursuits bring many families together, whether it’s attending services or saying grace together at 

## the dinner table. 

## 6. Sit around together flipping through old photo albums or watching vintage family videos and home 

## movies. You’ll relive fond memories and give one another hiccups laughing at the sight of certain members’ 

## now-outdated hairstyles and assorted fashion faux pas. “Wow, Dad: Really nice leisure suit.” 

## 7. Take a car ride. Where? Anywhere. Take the slow, scenic route and stop off at whatever looks interesting. 

## 8. Go bowling together. Golf and miniature golf are two other examples of individual sports that you can do 

## together. 

## 9. Build a fire in the fireplace, or at a camping ground, or on the beach, and share stories. 

## 10. Cook dinner together, with each member of the family taking part. 

## 11. Play board games, cards, dominoes and so on. 

## 12. Communal chores or collaborating on a household project can be a lot of fun.
