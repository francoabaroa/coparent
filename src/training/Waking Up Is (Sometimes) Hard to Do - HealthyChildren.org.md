# Waking Up Is (Sometimes) Hard to Do 

## By: Laura A. Jana, MD, FAAP & Jennifer Shu, MD, FAAP 

## You may have heard the age-old adage "never wake a sleeping baby." Many 

## expectant parents take this advice to heart and prepare themselves and their 

## homes accordingly. 

## In anticipation, they begin by turning the ringer off switches on their phones 

## and making signs to tape over their doorbells that read, "Please knock quietly 

## —baby sleeping." 

## After bringing home a newborn of your own, however, you're far more likely 

## to discover that most young babies (older babies are a different story) can 

## sleep through just about anything—vacuums, doorbells, and a whole host of 

## ringtones included. Instead of figuring out ways to ensure peaceful slumber, many new parents find themselves wondering if, in fact, their 

## babies would awaken to the sound of a freight train going by or the house being hit by a tornado. 

## You'll find that as your baby gets older, they will probably become a lighter sleeper. For the time being, however, feel free to relax a little on 

## the noise control unless, of course, you need it so you can sleep. 

## How to Wake a Sleeping Baby 

## As we mentioned at the outset, newborns have an impressive ability to ignore the world around them when they see fit to sleep. If you find 

## yourself in the position of needing to wake up your baby, here are some simple techniques that sometimes (notice we said "sometimes") 

## work. 

## The kinder, gentler approach. You might as well start out with the kinder, gentler approach to baby waking and see what kind of 

## response you get. This can include such basic measures as talking, singing, and gentle stimulation. Pick your baby up, talk to them, 

## move their arms and legs around, even tickle the bottom of their feet or rub their cheek—whatever works to rouse them. 

## Dressing down. Whether it's the physical stimulation or the increased exposure to cool air that does it, many newborns absolutely 

## hate to be undressed. Your newborn may find it well worth the time and effort it takes to awaken and voice their opinion. 

## Double-duty diapering. Even if your baby doesn't technically require one, going through the motions (even reusing the same diaper, 

## assuming it's still clean) may help if undressing alone doesn't do the trick. This works especially well for those babies who have a 

## tendency to fall asleep before finishing their meals. We think of it as dual-purpose diapering (/English/ages-stages/baby/diapers

## clothing/Pages/Changing-Diapers.aspx) because diaper changes not only tend to wake up sleeping babies but are more likely to be 

## needed around feeding times. 

## Cleanliness is next to wakefulness. Giving sleepy babies a bath (/english/ages-stages/baby/bathing-skin-care/pages/bathing-your

## newborn.aspx? 

## _gl=1%2axtd164%2a_ga%2aotcymzy5njkwlje2mjc0oti4odm.%2a_ga_fd9d3xzvqq%2amtyynzq5mjg4my4xljeumtyynzq5mjkymy4w&_ga= 

## 2.6340475.893803736.1627492883-972369690.1627492883) certainly takes things a step beyond undressing and changing diapers, but 

## has been known to work when all else fails. While we certainly don't approve of cruel and unusual punishment in any way, shape, or 

## form, there may be times when some of you simply have no other choice than to resort to a bath to get your baby to wake up. This 

## more "drastic" measure is most appropriately used sparingly, such as in the event that a newborn is long overdue to eat, and can be 

## modified to accommodate your baby's umbilical cord (/English/ages-stages/baby/bathing-skin-care/Pages/Umbilical-Cord-Care.aspx) 

## as needed. 

## Remember 

## The approaches we have described to you are obviously based on the assumption that your newborn is healthy. While it is true that 

## newborns are known to be challenging to wake up at times, you should also be aware that babies who are not easily aroused or responsive 

## despite their parents' best efforts need medical attention. Do not wait to discuss any questions or concerns you might have about your 

## baby's sleepiness with their doctor: Seek medical help immediately if your newborn seems increasingly sleepy, unresponsive, or hard to 

## arouse.
