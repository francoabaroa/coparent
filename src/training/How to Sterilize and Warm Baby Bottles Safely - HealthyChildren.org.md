# How to Sterilize and Warm Baby Bottles Safely 

## Parents and pediatricians today are not as concerned with 

## sterilizing bottles and water as they were a generation ago, but 

## many are now having second thoughts in light of recent reports of 

## contaminated city water supplies and increased concern over food 

## safety. 

## For starters, always wash your hands (/English/health

## issues/conditions/prevention/Pages/Hand-Washing-A

## Powerful-Antidote-to-Illness.aspx) before handling baby 

## bottles or feeding your baby. 

## If you use disposable plastic bottle liners and ready-to-use 

## formula, you still need to make sure the nipples are clean. 

## Scrub them in hot, soapy water, then rinse to get rid of all traces of soap; some experts recommend boiling them 

## for 5 minutes. 

## Always wash and thoroughly rinse and dry the top of the formula can before you open it; make sure the can 

## opener, mixing cups, jars, spoons, and other equipment are clean. 

## Glass Bottles & Formula Safety 

## If you use regular glass bottles and concentrated or powdered formula (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding

## nutrition/Pages/Formula-Form-and-Function-Powders-Concentrates-and-Ready-to-Feed.aspx), you must make sure 

## that the bottles and water added to the formula are germ free. You don't need to boil the bottles; you can put them, 

## along with mixing cups and other equipment used to prepare formula, in a dishwasher that uses heated water and has 

## a hot drying cycle. Or you can wash the bottles in hot, soapy water and rinse thoroughly. This alone should kill most 

## germs. 

## Mixing with Water 

## Water for mixing infant formula must be from a safe water source as defined by the state or local health department. 

## If you are concerned or uncertain about the safety of tap water (/English/safety-prevention/all-around/Pages/Is-Your

## Drinking-Water-Safe.aspx), you may use bottled water or bring cold tap water to a rolling boil for 1 minute (no longer), 

## then cool the water to room temperature for no more than 30 minutes before it is used. Warmed water should be 

## tested in advance to make sure it is not too hot for the baby. The easiest way to test the temperature is to shake a few 

## drops on the inside of your wrist. Otherwise, a bottle can be prepared by adding powdered formula and room

## temperature water from the tap just before feeding. Bottles made in this way from powdered formula can be ready for 

## feeding because no additional refrigeration or warming would be required. 

## Storing Prepared Formula 

## Prepared formula must be discarded within 1 hour after serving a baby. 

## Prepared formula that has not been given to a baby may be stored in the refrigerator for 24 hours to prevent 

## bacterial contamination. 

## An open container of ready-to-feed, concentrated formula, or formula prepared from concentrated formula, 

## should be covered, refrigerated, and discarded after 48 hours if not used.
