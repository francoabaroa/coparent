# Create a Potty Training Plan for Your Child 

## Having potty-training plan for your child and knowing 

## the best time to start it can make the toilet training 

## process go more smoothly. But there are certain 

## universal rules relating to toilet training—as well as to 

## other aspects of parenting—that will enhance your 

## family's experience no matter what method you choose. 

## Some important points to remember: 

## Be positive. Children learn best when they are 

## praised for their progress rather than punished for 

## their mistakes. Do what you can to help your child 

## succeed as often as possible—even if it means 

## learning gradually, one tiny step at a time. When 

## they progress, give them a hug, some praise, and perhaps even a small tangible reward. When they fails, tell them 

## you're sure they'll do better next time and ask them to help you clean up. 

## Try to be as consistent as possible. Create reasonable expectations according to your child's abilities, express 

## them clearly and frequently, and expect your child to at least try to follow them every time. Keep their bathroom 

## routine as consistent as possible, with their potty in the same place every day and the sequence of actions— 

## including wiping and hand washing—the same every time. While they are toilet-training, praise your child for 

## each success, and provide predictable, nonpunitive consequences (such as helping to clean up) for each failure. 

## Make sure that your approach to toilet training is consistent with those of your child's other caregivers as well. 

## Stay involved and observe. Very young children's needs, behaviors, and abilities change frequently and, to some 

## extent, unpredictably. Toilet-training approaches that worked two weeks ago may not work today, and skills that 

## your child mastered in the past may temporarily disappear in the face of new challenges. Continue to monitor 

## your child's bathroom behavior throughout toilet training and afterward so that you can quickly identify and 

## resolve any new problems that arise. 

## Enjoy. Toilet training is a necessary chore, but it can also be fun at times. Don't take your child's hesitations, 

## passing fears, or resistance too seriously. Nearly every child learns to use the toilet sooner or later, and your child 

## will, too. Do what you can to occasionally take your eye off the long-term goal and enjoy the charming, funny 

## moments along the way. 

## A potty-training plan of your child's own 

## If you are concerned that designing a potty-training plan to suit your particular child may prove more difficult than 

## following a prepackaged, one-size-fits-all program, keep in mind the advantages. It doesn't take a great deal of effort to 

## figure out whether your child is more a talker or a doer, or a lover of adult-imposed routine or an independent soul 

## who prefers to control their own actions. In the process of figuring that out, you and your child will have gotten to 

## know each other better. Plus, your child will have learned a new skill in a way that increased their confidence, their 

## sense of security, and their self-esteem. What a wonderful process to have been a part of!
