# Indoor Play Ideas: Fun Ways for Families to Connect 

## Whether your family needs to isolate after a positive 

## COVID test (/English/health-issues/conditions/COVID

## 19/Pages/How-to-Talk-to-Your-Child-about-Their

## Positive-COVID-19-Test.aspx), or storms cancel outdoor 

## plans, being stuck at home can create some serious 

## cabin fever. To help cope, focus on positive points that 

## are in your control. A big upside of more indoor family 

## time: more chances to connect with each another 

## through simple play. 

## Here are some easy ways to deepen your connection 

## with your kids through different kinds of play. At the 

## same time, these activities can build on their learning 

## and development. 

## Work & play side-by-side 

## Imitating grown-ups and chipping in at home builds a sense of independence and responsibility. Involve kids as you 

## clean, prepare meals, and make shopping lists! As you enlist kids to help in the actual cooking (/English/healthy

## living/nutrition/Pages/Cooking-With-Your-Children.aspx) of meals, also gather some of their play food and kitchen

## themed toys at the table. They can explore these while you're at the stove. Even empty pasta or cereal boxes or oatmeal 

## and spice containers can be fun. The conversation and just being present with one another while you play (and work!) 

## side-by-side is what's most important here. 

## Some questions to ask them while your kids are pretend playing in the kitchen: 

## What are you making? 

## What will you call your creation? 

## How do you think it will taste? Can you describe the flavors to me? 

## Also try to get in the habit of narrating your everyday activities. ("Now I have to mince the onion into tiny pieces.") Kids 

## pick up new vocabulary as they hear you use words in context. 

## Pretend with friends 

## A great way to check in on your child's emotional health and well-being is to use dolls, stuffed animals and puppets. 

## For example, if your child is going to school virtually, suggest during playtime they pretend to send their favorite doll 

## or stuffed animal to school. Listen carefully to their narrative to uncover any underlying concerns or challenges they 

## may be facing in real life. 

## Some questions to ask: 

## What does [ doll's name] find hard at school? What's easy? What's frustrating? 

## Pretend the doll is crying and say: "Hmm... I wonder why the doll might be sad?" 

## Pretend the doll is laughing and say: "Hmm... I wonder why the baby might be laughing?" 

## Get creative with arts & crafts 

## Coloring and art projects can help reduce stress, for parents and children. Work together on a drawing or craft 

## project, taking turns adding elements. This helps build flexibility and collaborative thinking. The outcome isn't 

## important; it's about the quality time, the memory-making and the engaging social interaction.

#### Some points to consider: 

#### Brainstorm together. Brainstorming ideas, testing them out, and taking steps to finish a project are skills that 

#### will help children throughout their lives. Model brainstorming by pretending to not know what to do next (e.g., 

#### what color or material to choose) and saying, "Hmm, I think we're stuck. What can we try?" 

#### Share & imagine. The pandemic has limited children's contact with far-flung relatives and friends. Encourage 

#### kids to make a drawing to mail to a grandparent or loved one. As they're drawing, talk about the recipient and 

#### some of their favorite things. Wonder aloud how that person might be feeling this time of year. This can help 

#### kids practice understanding another person's point of view and emotions. 

## Sort, build & explore 

#### Children learn and grow when they explore the physical world. Their minds learn best when they interact and play 

#### with parents, siblings, caregivers and others. Help build gross and fine motor skills by placing pieces just out of reach 

#### and having kids pull them near. Make observations as you play together. Joint attention—caregivers and kids looking 

#### at objects while playing and talking—helps with social thinking and language. 

#### As kids play, draw attention to their senses. Ask: 

#### What colors do you see? 

### [ Clap two pieces together.] Ooh—listen to that! Can you make that sound? 

#### Which looks/feels/sounds better to you, this or that? 

## Remember 

#### Play time with siblings and grown-ups help kids build brain connections, develop their emotional skills, and 

#### strengthen their relationships. During this time when many children are not able to see teachers, friends and other 

#### caregivers, the chance to play with adults and siblings in their own home can provide an important connection. 

#### It may not always be easy for families to carve out time to play. But the more you practice and enjoy it, the more it 

#### becomes part of your parenting tool chest.
