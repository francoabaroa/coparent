# 10 Non-Tech Holiday Gift Ideas to Promote Kids’ Language 

# & Learning 

## Children of all ages are filling their holiday wish list 

## with things like tablets, cell phones, wearables, 

## headphones, and other tech-related gifts. But it's 

## important to find a balance and ensure that today's 

## connected kids (/English/family

## The holidays are a great time to get back to some of the 

## basics in childhood play that foster communication and 

## social interaction. 

## Ideas for a Low-Tech Holiday 

## Gift List: 

## Traditional toys remain superior to electronic toys for children's language development. For example, when 

## toys talk, parents talk less—and subsequently, kids vocalize less. Blocks, dolls, musical instruments, cars, trains, 

## shape-sorters, and other low-tech toys get kids—and parents—talking, singing, playing, and interacting. These all 

## help build foundational communication skills. 

## Books always make excellent presents, and sharing the joy of reading is a lifelong gift. 

## For infants and toddlers : Books with textures inviting touch are ideal, as are colorful board and picture 

## books. 

## For children learning how to read : Give books appropriate to their skill level to facilitate emerging 

## literacy. 

## For older children : Find engaging chapter books and book series. Family members can take turns reading 

## chapters aloud. This may be the start of a family book club. 

## Board, card, and conversation-based question games are great to enjoy and play as a family. They get 

## everyone talking and laughing and build some great memories. There are games for all age ranges. And what 

## better time of year than winter to begin family game nights for building conversation, connections—and fun! 

## Costumes and other dress-up accessories allow kids to use their imaginations and foster creativity. Children's 

## language skills expand as they make up dialogues, tell stories, sing, and take turns. 

## Building toys, blocks, and crafts make for some fun indoor activities to occupy kids on cold days. They also 

## help hone fine motor skills for all ages. For young children, motor skills are closely linked to language 

## development. 

## Outdoor toys such as balls, sleds, jump ropes, and yard games encourage running, jumping, sports and other 

## active play. Physical activity and movement prime children for learning. 

## Puzzles —ranging from basic options for young children to complex types the whole family can attempt as a 

## team—spur conversation while building analytical, problem-solving and other skills. 

## Cooking supplies work as fun gifts for children of almost any age. Involving young kids in making and trying 

## new foods offers a wealth of opportunity for conversation and language-building, including likes and dislikes, 

## tastes, textures, and more. For older kids, cooking together sets the scene for family bonding. Following recipes

### also helps improve reading and comprehension skills, planning, organization, sequencing, and following

### Crayons, colored pencils, coloring books and other writing supplies are a childhood staple, and they help 

### children build fine-motor skills. Coloring also helps young children build their vocabulary and learn their color 

### names. 

### Tickets to child-friendly shows, sporting events, or other performances are great gifts, as they allow parents 

### and children to enjoy special activities together. These outings promote family interaction, conversation, and 

### bonding. In addition, memberships to local zoos, museums or aquariums make great gifts for entire families to
