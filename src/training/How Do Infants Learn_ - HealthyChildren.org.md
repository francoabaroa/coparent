# How Do Infants Learn? 

## Infants Are Amazing 

## In the very beginning, it may seem that your baby does nothing but eat, sleep, cry, and fill her 

## diapers. But your infant is learning too. She can see and hear what is happening around her and 

## can communicate her needs and interests to others. Parents can help their babies learn by 

## playing with them. 

## Infants have the ability to see faces and objects of different shapes, sizes, and colors. They can tell 

## the difference between the voices of their parents and others. We’re surprised when they mold 

## their bodies into our arms or shoulders. We marvel at how they came into the world able to suck (/English/ages

## stages/baby/Pages/Newborn-Reflexes.aspx), communicate certain needs by crying (/English/ages

## stages/baby/crying-colic/Pages/Responding-to-Your-Babys-Cries.aspx), and, at times, calm (/English/ages

## stages/baby/crying-colic/pages/Calming-A-Fussy-Baby.aspx) down on their own. Most infants can do all of these 

## things as soon as they are born. 

## You Are Your Baby’s First Teacher 

## First experiences have a very important effect on the future. That’s why you are so important to your baby’s growth 

## and development. The growth of your baby’s brain is affected by the care and experiences (/English/ages

## stages/baby/Pages/Parenting-Your-Infant.aspx) you provide. Loving attention helps new brain cells connect in ways 

## that help infants: 

## Feel secure and confident. 

## Make sense of new ideas and information. 

## Grow healthy bodies. 

## Things To Watch For 

## Your baby has a different style or personality (/English/ages-stages/baby/pages/Babys-Temperament.aspx) from all 

## other babies. It’s fun to get to know your baby’s likes, needs, and abilities. Find out how your baby relates to other 

## people and situations. 

## Some infants like more activity, some like less. 

## Some infants are louder when they laugh or cry, some are quieter by nature. 

## All infants let us know when they have had enough. Some ways your baby may tell you that it’s time for a nap are: 

## Avoids making eye contact 

## Becomes sleepy or fussy, may cry a lot 

## Coughs or spits 

## Rubs eyes 

## Take Care of Yourself 

## Children grow faster in their first year than at any other time in their lives. This will take a lot of your time and energy. 

## You need to be healthy and happy to give your child the best start possible. When you feel good about yourself, you 

## will be helping your baby feel happy and secure too. This is why you need to find the time to take care of yourself. Let 

## people know when you need support or help. After you are rested, you will have more energy and you will be able to 

## have more fun with your baby. 

## Others Who Care For Your Baby 

## Developing a close bond with parents and family members is important. It helps infants form positive relationships 

## with others.

### By letting other people hold and talk with your baby when you are around, your baby learns how to relate to other 

### people. 

### When you cannot be with your baby, it is best if the same few trusted people are the caregivers (/English/family

### life/work-play/Pages/What-Caregivers-Need-to-Know-About-Feeding-Children.aspx). Your baby will learn to 

### expect and enjoy their company and kindness. 

### If you decide to leave your baby with a relative (/English/family-life/work-play/Pages/A-Message-for

### Grandparents-Who-Provide-Childcare.aspx), friend, or professional child care provider (/English/family

### life/work-play/Pages/Choosing-a-Childcare-Center.aspx), make sure that the caregiver and surroundings 

### adequately provide a healthy, safe and comforting environment. This way, you will feel confident about the safe 

### and loving care being provided. 

## A Strong Start for Life 

### Infants spend the first year learning to feel secure about being loved. Love—expressed in the ways mentioned here, 

### and in many other ways by you—will give your child the physical strength to fight illness, the emotional strength to 

### feel confident, and the ability to learn new things.
