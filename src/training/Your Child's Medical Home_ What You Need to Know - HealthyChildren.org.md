# Your Child's Medical Home: What You Need to Know 

## A medical home (/English/family-life/health-management/pages/A-Medical-Home-Where

## Everybody-Knows-Your-Name.aspx) is the kind of care we all want and deserve – it is the way your 

## child’s pediatric healthcare team approaches providing care for your child. 

## A medical home means that: 

## Your pediatric team 

## Knows your child’s health history 

## Listens to your concerns and needs, as well as your child’s 

## Works in partnership with you to make sure that the medical and non-medical needs of your child and 

## family are met 

## Creates a trusting, collaborative relationship with you and your child 

## Treats your child with compassion and an understanding of his/her strengths 

## Develops a care plan with you and your child when needed 

## Respects and honors your culture and traditions 

## You and your child 

## Are comfortable sharing concerns and questions with your pediatric team and other health care providers 

## Routinely communicate your child’s needs and family priorities to your pediatric team who promote 

## communication and coordination between your family and other health care providers, as well as 

## educational and community services when necessary 

## You Can Make Medical Home Improvements 

## You can work with your doctor’s office to make your child’s medical home even better. The following are a few things 

## to think about and to discuss with your child’s primary care provider (/english/tips-tools/find

## pediatrician/Pages/Pediatrician-Referral-Service.aspx): 

## How can we as parents help you become an even better medical home? Does the practice have a ‘family 

## advisory council’ that informs and advises the practice on how to improve their patients’ experience? If not, how 

## can we work together to create one? 

## How can we work together to develop: 

## Information describing the practice and how to access appropriate care (e.g., patient brochure or Web site)? 

## 24-hour contact? 

## Extended access to care? 

## A patient satisfaction survey? 

## An accessible waiting room? 

## Let your doctor know how important these improvements are to you and your child’s medical home.
