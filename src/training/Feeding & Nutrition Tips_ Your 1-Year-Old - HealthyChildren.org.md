# Feeding & Nutrition Tips: Your 1-Year-Old 

## After your child's first birthday, you'll probably notice a sharp drop 

## in his or her appetite. Maybe your child is suddenly turning his or 

## her head away after just a few bites and/or is resisting coming to the 

## table at mealtimes. Despite this behavior and increased activity, 

## there's a good reason for the change. Your child's growth rate has 

## slowed; he or she really doesn't require as much food now. 

## Tips for Parents: 

## One year olds need about 1,000 calories divided among 

## three meals and two snacks per day to meet their needs for 

## growth, energy, and good nutrition. Don't count on your child 

## always eating it that way though—the eating habits of toddlers are erratic and unpredictable from one day to the 

## next! For example, your child may: 

## Eat everything in sight at breakfast and almost nothing else for the rest of the day. 

## Eat only the same food for three days in a row—and then reject it entirely. 

## Eat 1,000 calories one day, but then eat noticeably more or less over the next day or two. 

## Encourage, but don't pressure or force your child to eat at a particular time. Hard as it may be to believe, 

## your child's diet will balance out over several days if you make a range of wholesome foods available. 

## One year olds need foods from the same basic nutrition groups that you do. If you provide your child with 

## selections from each of the basic food groups (/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/nutrition/Pages/Making

## Healthy-Food-Choices.aspx) and let him or her experiment with a wide variety of tastes, colors, and textures, he 

## or she should be eating a balanced diet with plenty of vitamins. 

## Don't restrict fats from your one-year-old's menu. Babies and young toddlers should get about half of their 

## calories from fat. Cholesterol and other fats are also very important for their growth and development at this age. 

## Once your child has reached age two, you can gradually decrease fat consumption (lowering it to about one-third 

## of daily calories by ages four to five). See Preschoolers' Diets Shouldn't Be Fat-Free: Here's Why (/English/ages

## stages/preschool/nutrition-fitness/Pages/Reducing-Dietary-Fat-for-Preschoolers.aspx) for more information. 

## Be sure the food is cool enough to prevent mouth burns. Test the temperature yourself, because he or she will 

## dig in without considering the heat. 

## Don't give foods that are heavily spiced, salted, buttered, or sweetened. These additions prevent your child 

## from experiencing the natural taste of foods, and they may be harmful to long-term good health. 

## Your little one can still choke on chunks of food. Children don't learn to chew with a grinding motion until 

## they're about four years old. Make sure anything you give your child is mashed or cut into small, easily chewable 

## pieces. 

## Never offer peanuts, whole grapes, cherry tomatoes (unless they're cut in quarters), whole carrots, seeds 

## (i.e., processed pumpkin or sunflower seeds), whole or large sections of hot dogs, meat sticks, or hard 

## candies (including jelly beans or gummy bears), or chunks of peanut butter (it's fine to thinly spread peanut 

## butter on a cracker or bread). 

## Hot dogs and carrots— in particular—should be quartered lengthwise and then sliced into small pieces. 

## Make sure your child eats only while seated and while supervised by an adult. Although your one-year-old 

## may want to do everything at once, "eating on the run" or while talking increases the risk of choking. Teach your 

## child as early as possible to finish a mouthful prior to speaking.
