# How Often and How Much Should Your Baby Eat? 

## By: Sanjeev Jain, MD, FAAP 

## One of the most common questions new parents have is how often 

## their baby should eat. The best answer is surprisingly simple: in 

## general, babies should be fed whenever they seem hungry. 

## How do I know when my baby is 

## hungry? 

## For babies born prematurely (/English/ages

## stages/baby/preemie/Pages/default.aspx) or with certain medical 

## conditions, scheduled feedings advised by your pediatrician are 

## best. But for most healthy, full-term infants, parents can look to their baby rather than the clock for hunger cues. This 

## is called feeding on demand, or responsive feeding (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Is-Your-Baby

## Hungry-or-Full-Responsive-Feeding-Explained.aspx). 

## Hunger cues 

## A hungry baby often will cry. But it's best to watch for hunger cues before the baby starts crying (/English/ages

## stages/baby/crying-colic/Pages/Responding-to-Your-Babys-Cries.aspx), which is a late sign of hunger and can make it 

## hard for them to settle down and eat. 

## Some other typical hunger cues in babies: 

## Licking lips 

## Sticking tongue out 

## Rooting (moving jaw and mouth or head in search of breast) 

## Putting his/her hand to mouth repeatedly 

## Opening her mouth 

## Fussiness 

## Sucking on everything around 

## It is important to realize, however, that every time your baby cries or sucks it is not necessarily because he or she is 

## hungry. Babies suck not only for hunger, but also for comfort; it can be hard at first for parents to tell the difference. 

## Sometimes, your baby just needs to be cuddled or changed. 

## General guidelines for baby feeding 

## It is important to remember all babies are different―some like to snack more often, and others drink more at one 

## time and go longer between feedings. However, most babies will drink more and go longer between feedings as they 

## get bigger and their tummies can hold more milk: 

## Most newborns eat every 2 to 3 hours, or 8 to 12 times every 24 hours. Babies might only take in half ounce per 

## feeding for the first day or two of life, but after that will usually drink 1 to 2 ounces at each feeding. This amount 

## increases to 2 to 3 ounces by 2 weeks of age. 

## At about 2 months of age, babies usually take 4 to 5 ounces per feeding every 3 to 4 hours. 

## At 4 months , babies usually take 4 to 6 ounces per feeding. 


##### At 6 months , babies may be taking up to 8 ounces every 4 to 5 hours. 

##### Most babies will increase the amount of formula they drink by an average of 1 ounce each month before leveling off at 

##### about 7 to 8 ounces per feeding. Solid foods (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Starting-Solid

##### Foods.aspx) should be started at about 6 months old. 

## Concerns about overfeeding or underfeeding your baby 

### Too full? 

##### Babies are usually pretty good at eating the right amount, but they can sometimes take in more than they need. 

##### Infants who are bottle feeding (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Practical-Bottle-Feeding

##### Tips.aspx)may be more likely to overfeed, because drinking from a bottle may take less effort than breastfeeding. 

##### (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/default.aspx) 

##### Overfed babies can have stomach pains, gas, spit up (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Remedies

##### for-Spitty-Babies.aspx) or vomit and be at higher risk for obesity later in life. It's better to offer less, since you can 

##### always give more if your baby wants it. This also gives babies time to realize when they're full. 

#### If you are concerned your baby wants to eat all the time ― even when he or she is full―talk with your pediatrician. 

##### Pacifiers (/English/ages-stages/baby/crying-colic/Pages/Pacifiers-Satisfying-Your-Babys-Needs.aspx) may be used 

##### after feeding to help sooth healthy-weight babies who like to suck for comfort, rather than nutrition. For babies who 

##### are breastfed, it's best to wait to offer pacifiers until around 3 to 4 weeks of age, when breastfeeding is well-established. 

### Trouble gaining weight? 

##### Most babies will double their birth weight by 5 months of age and triple their birth weight by their first birthday. If 

##### your baby is having trouble gaining weight, don't wait too long between feeding―even if it means waking your baby. 

##### Be sure to talk with your pediatrician about how often and how much to feed your baby. 

## How do I know if my baby is getting enough to eat? 

### Daily diapers 

##### A newborn's diaper (/English/ages-stages/baby/diapers-clothing/Pages/Diaper-Changing-101.aspx) is a good indicator 

##### of whether he or she is getting enough to eat. In the first few days after birth, a baby should have 2 to 3 wet diapers 

##### each day. After the first 4 to 5 days, a baby should have at least 5 to 6 wet diapers a day. Stool frequency is more variable 

##### and depends whether your baby is breastfed (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/How-to-Tell-if-Baby-is

##### Getting-Enough-Milk.aspx) or formula fed. 

### Growth charts 

##### During regular health check-ups, your pediatrician will check your baby's weight and plot it on a growth chart 

##### (/English/health-issues/conditions/Glands-Growth-Disorders/Pages/Growth-Charts-By-the-Numbers.aspx). Your 

##### baby's progress on the growth chart is one way to tell whether or not they are getting enough food. Babies who stay in 

#### healthy growth percentile ranges are probably getting a healthy amount of food during feedings. 

## Remember 

##### Talk with your pediatrician if you have any questions or concerns about your baby getting the right amount to eat.
