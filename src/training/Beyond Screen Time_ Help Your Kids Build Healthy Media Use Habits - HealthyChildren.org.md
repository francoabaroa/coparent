# Beyond Screen Time: Help Your Kids Build Healthy Media 

# Use Habits 

## Media in all forms, including TV, computers and 

## smartphones can affect how children feel, learn, think 

## and behave. However, as a parent, you are still the most 

## important influence. 

## Read on for tips on how to help your children develop 

## healthy media use habits early on. 

## Media use and your children 

## There are risks and benefits (/English/family

## life/Media/Pages/Adverse-Effects-of-Television

## Commercials.aspx) that come with media use, and the 

## key is to develop habits that help your family strike a healthy balance. You can decide what media use is best for your 

## family. Remember, all children and teens need adequate sleep (8–12 hours, depending on age), physical activity (1 

## hour), and time away from media. (See the "Media Use Guidelines" chart, below, for general guidelines for media use 

## based on age.) 

## Because children today are growing up in a time of highly personalized media use experiences, parents must develop 

## personalized media use plans for their children. Media plans should take into account each child's age, health, 

## personality, and developmental stage. 

## Create a Family Media Plan online at HealthyChildren.org/MediaUsePlan (/MediaUsePlan). This lets you give 

## consistent expectations and limits on media use that will help your kids balance media use with other healthy 

## activities. 


### Media Use Guidelines for Families 

#### Age Description Media Use Guidelines 

#### Younger than 2 years old Children younger than 2 learn and 

#### grow when they explore the physical 

#### world around them. Their minds 

#### learn best when they interact and 

#### play with parents, siblings, 

#### caregivers, and other children and 

#### adults. 

#### Children younger than 2 have a hard 

#### time understanding what they see 

#### on screen media and how it relates 

#### to the world around them. 

#### However, children 18–24 months of 

#### age can learn from high-quality 

#### educational media, IF their parents 

#### play or view with them and reteach 

#### the lessons. 

#### Media use should be very 

#### limited and only when an adult 

#### is standing by to co-view, talk, 

#### and teach (for example, video 

#### chatting with family along with 

#### parents). 

#### For children 18–24 months, if 

#### you want to introduce digital 

#### media, 

#### Choose high-quality 

#### programming. 

#### Use media together with 

#### your child. 

#### Avoid solo media use. 

#### 2 to 5 years of age At 2 years of age, many children can 

#### understand and learn words from 

#### live video chatting. Young children 

#### can listen to or join a conversation 

#### with their parents. 

#### Children 3–5 years of age have more 

#### mature minds, so a well-designed 

#### educational program such as 

#### Sesame Street (in moderation) can 

#### help children learn social, language, 

#### and reading skills. 

#### Limit screen use to no more 

#### than 1 hour per day. 

#### Find other activities for your 

#### children to do that are healthy 

#### for their bodies and minds. 

#### Choose media that is 

#### interactive, nonviolent, 

#### educational, and pro-social. 

#### Co-view or co-play with your 

#### children. 

#### 5 years and older Today’s grade-schoolers and teens 

#### are growing up immersed in digital 

#### media. They may even have their 

#### own mobile device and other devices 

#### to access digital media. 

#### Make sure media use is not 

#### displacing other important 

#### activities, such as sleep, family 

#### time, and exercise. 

#### Check your children’s media 

#### use for their health and safety. 

#### Tweens and teens Tweens and teens are more likely to 

#### have some independence in what 

#### they choose and watch, and they may 

#### be consuming media without 

#### parental oversight. 

#### Parents should engage tweens and 

#### teens in conversations about their 

#### media use, digital citizenship, what 

#### they’ve seen or read, who they are 

#### communicating with, and what they 

#### have learned from their media use. 

## Healthy digital media use tips for families 

#### Do not feel pressured to introduce technology early. Media devices are designed to be intuitive, and children can 

#### learn quickly.

#### Find out what type of and how much media are used and what media behaviors are appropriate for each child— 

#### and for you. Place consistent limits on hours of media use as well as types of media used. 

#### Select and co-view media with your child so they can use media to learn, be creative, and share these experiences 

#### with your family. 

#### Check your children's media use for their health and safety. 

#### Stop use of devices or screens for 1 hour before bedtime. Do not let your children sleep with devices such as 

#### smartphones. 

#### Discourage entertainment media while doing homework. 

#### Plan media-free times together, such as family dinners. 

#### Decide on media-free, unplugged locations in homes, such as bedrooms. 

#### Engage in family activities that promote well-being, such as sports, reading, and talking with each other. 

#### Set a good example. Turn off the TV and put your smartphone on "do not disturb" during media-free times with 

#### your family. 

#### Use sites like Common Sense Media (www.commonsensemedia.org) to help you decide if movies, TV shows 

#### (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/TV-Ratings-A-Guide-for-Parents.aspx), apps, and video games 

#### (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/Video-Games-Set-Your-Own-Ratings-System.aspx) are age and content 

#### appropriate for your children and your family values. 

#### Share your family media rules with caregivers or grandparents to help ensure rules are consistent. 

#### Talk with your children and teens about online citizenship and safety. This includes treating others with respect 

#### online, avoiding cyberbullying (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/Cyberbullying.aspx) and sexting, 

#### (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/The-New-Problem-of-Sexting.aspx) being wary of online solicitations, and 

#### safeguarding privacy. 

#### Remember that your opinion counts. TV, video games, and other media producers, airers, and sponsors pay 

#### attention to the views of the public. For more information from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), 

#### visit http://reboot.fcc.gov/parents (http://reboot.fcc.gov/parents). 

#### Encourage your school and community to advocate for better media programs and healthier habits. For example, 

#### organize a Screen-Free Week in your town with other parents, teachers, and neighbors.
