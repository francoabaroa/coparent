# Cognitive Development: One-Year-Old 

## As you watch your toddler at play, have you noticed how hard she concentrates on everything she 

## does? Each game or task is a learning proposition, and she’ll gather all sorts of information about 

## the way things work. She’ll also now be able to draw on facts she’s already learned in order to 

## make decisions and find solutions to play-related challenges. However, she’ll be interested in 

## solving only those problems that are appropriate for her developmental and learning level, so 

## hand her a toy that fascinated her at eleven months and she may walk away bored. Or suggest a 

## game that’s too advanced and she’ll object. She’ll be especially attracted to mechanical devices, 

## such as wind-up toys, switches, buttons, and knobs. It may be difficult for you to judge exactly 

## what she can and can’t handle at this age, but it’s not hard for her to decide. Provide her with a 

## range of activities, and she’ll select the ones that are challenging but not completely beyond her abilities. 

## Imitation is a big part of her learning process at this age. Instead of simply manipulating household objects, as she did 

## during her first year, she’ll actually use a brush on her hair, babble into the phone, turn the steering wheel of her toy 

## car, and push it back and forth. At first, she’ll be the only one involved in these activities, but gradually she’ll include 

## other players. She might brush her doll’s hair, “read” to you from her book, offer a playmate a pretend drink, or hold 

## her toy phone to your ear. Because imitation is such an important part of her behavior and learning, now, perhaps 

## more than ever, you need to be aware of the behaviors that you are modeling for her. Remember, things that you say or 

## do might be replayed (either to your great pleasure or dismay!) over and over again as she plays and learns. Older 

## siblings are crucial here. This copying behavior happens between toddlers and their older siblings. It is an ideal time 

## to take advantage of these natural developmental cues. 

## Well before her second birthday, your toddler will excel at hiding games, remembering where hidden objects are long 

## after they leave her sight. If you pocket her ball or cracker while she’s playing, you may forget all about it, but she 

## won’t! 

## As she masters hide-and-seek, she’ll also become more understanding about separations from you. Just as she knows 

## that a hidden object is somewhere, even when she can’t see it, she’ll now recognize that you always come back, even 

## when you’re away from her a whole day. If you actually show her where you go when you leave her—to work or to the 

## grocery store, for example—she’ll form a mental image of you there. This may make the separation even easier for 

## her. 

## At this age, your toddler is very much the director; she lets you know what role she wants you to play in her activities. 

## Sometimes she’ll bring you a toy so you can help her make it work; other times she’ll pull it away from you to try it by 

## herself. Often, when she knows she’s done something special, she’ll pause and wait for your applause. By responding 

## to these cues, you’ll provide the support and encouragement she needs to keep learning. 

## You also must supply the judgment that she still lacks. Yes, she now understands how certain things behave, but— 

## because she can’t see how one thing affects another—she doesn’t yet grasp the full notion of consequences. So even 

## though she may understand that her toy wagon will roll downhill, she can’t predict what will happen when it lands in 

## the middle of the busy street below. Although she knows that a door swings open and shut, she doesn’t know that she 

## has to keep her hand from getting caught in it. And even if she’s found out the hard way once, don’t assume she’s 

## learned her lesson. Chances are she doesn’t associate her pain with the chain of events that led up to it, and she almost 

## certainly won’t remember this sequence the next time. Until she develops her own common sense, she’ll need your 

## vigilance to keep her safe.
