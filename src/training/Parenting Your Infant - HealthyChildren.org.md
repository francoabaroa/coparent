# Parenting Your Infant 

## All infants: 

## Love to explore the world around them, so you have to make your home safe. 

## Have their own personalities, which may be different from their parents’. 

## Put new and stressful demands on parents, so parents may need to ask for help. 

## Need routines that match their unique abilities, and parents may need to adjust their 

## schedules to fit this new individual. 

## Your baby is now smiling and cooing and will soon start to move around more. These are signs of your baby’s 

## personality and the start of a lifelong learning process. 

## Infants Do Talk 

## When infants begin to babble, they like the people around them to talk back. Have fun talking with your baby. 

## Make silly noises. 

## Play peek-a-boo games. 

## Sing songs. 

## Show and talk about simple picture books. 

## This is the way your baby learns how to talk. 

## Infants Love To Explore 

## You may have noticed that your baby is becoming interested in everything within reach, especially simple toys with 

## bright colors and ones that make noise. It seems that whatever infants grab, it finds its way into their mouths. 

## By age 3 or 4 months, infants are drooling and chewing on the things they put into their mouths. This is how they learn 

## about the world around them. 

## Make sure that you never give infants a toy so small that it fits entirely in their mouths or a toy with parts that can 

## break off easily. This can lead to choking! 

## Infants Have Personalities 

## Even very tiny infants act in very individual ways. Some are loud and active, others are quiet and passive. Some are 

## easygoing and cuddly, others are very serious. Some are relaxed, others are more high-strung. As a parent, you already 

## know your baby’s unique personality. 

## Think about this personality when you are caring for your baby. 

## If your baby is naturally fussy and has difficulty calming down, avoid too much stimulation. 

## If your baby is sensitive to changes in routines, make sure that your days are not too busy or filled with lots of 

## changes. If your baby’s personality is different from yours, remember that what makes your baby comfortable 

## and happy may not feel right for you. 

## Independence Is Starting 

## As infants get older, they:

#### Begin to roll over. 

#### Reach for toys, spoons, and other objects. 

#### Want to sit up. 

#### This is the beginning of independence, but babies do not know what might put them in danger. Keeping your baby in a 

#### safe place, such as in a crib or in a playpen, will prevent falls, burns, poisoning, choking, and other injuries. 

#### Childproofing your home can also help keep your baby safe. 

## Some Common Problems 

#### Most infants will go through the following difficulties, which can be very frustrating for parents, but they will soon 

#### outgrow them. 

#### Colic This is not caused by anything you have done. This usually goes away at about age 4 to 5 months. 

#### Trouble Sleeping Some infants will have trouble either falling asleep or waking up often during the night. 

#### Clinging To Parents When infants don’t see certain people (even close friends and grandparents) very often, they 

#### may become afraid of them. 

#### Even though these problems will go away, it can be very upsetting while they are occurring. Talk with your 

#### pediatrician about ideas that will work for you and your baby until these problems go away. 

## Infants Thrive In Happy Families 

#### Just like adults, infants do best with happy and healthy people around them. Look for parent/baby groups, support 

#### groups, or organizations in your community where parents with common interests can meet and get to know each 

#### other. If things are not going well in your family, if you need help finding groups in your neighborhood, or if you are 

#### worried about your baby, talk with your pediatrician. You are not alone; many other parents have these same 

#### concerns. 

## Starting New Routines 

#### Now that you are beginning to know your baby’s patterns, your family, like many others, may be starting new routines. 

#### Here are some tips to help you. 

### Taking Care of Yourself Is Important 

#### Even though infants usually are lovable, most parents have moments of frustration, and even anger, with their baby. 

#### Feeling this way is common and normal. What is important is how you deal with these feelings. When this happens to 

#### you, place your baby in a safe place like a crib or playpen and do something to relax and calm down—have a cup of tea 

#### or coffee, listen to music, call a friend or spouse, read, or meditate. These feelings of stress are natural and will pass. 

### Reach Out To Family and Friends, or Make New Friends With Other Parents 

#### Having other adults to share the experience of raising a child can make all the difference in the world. If you are at 

#### home with your baby every day, it is a good idea to leave your baby with another trusted adult once in a while. Use this 

#### time to take care of yourself or be with your partner. Babies are delightful, but all parents need a break!
