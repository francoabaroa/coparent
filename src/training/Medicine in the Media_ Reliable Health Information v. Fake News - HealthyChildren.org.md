# Medicine in the Media: Reliable Health Information v. 

# Fake News 

## One challenge of parenting is sorting through all 

## available information about children's health. Some 

## sources can be trusted, while others should be 

## questioned. 

## Aside from your pediatrician, which sources for health 

## information can you trust? Read on for information 

## about the language of advertisers, good science, 

## questioning your sources and evaluating new 

## treatments or medicines. 

## Medicine ads: knowing the 

## language 

## Commercials and magazine ads claim products help and heal. Websites claim to have "cutting-edge" health 

## information. TV programs and newspapers report on the "latest" studies showing which treatments work and don't 

## work. 

## Advertisers try many ways to get you to buy the products they are selling. They may use certain words or phrases to 

## interest you, such as: 

## "#1 pediatrician recommended" or "doctor recommended." These are marketing terms that try to get you to 

## buy a product. Although the product may be recommended by a group of doctors, what the advertisers don't tell 

## you is how many doctors or how long ago the recommendation was made. It could be five or 100 doctors 

## surveyed 10 years ago. 

## "Patented design." A patent means that the maker or inventor of a product has proven to the government that he 

## or she was the first to create the product. In return, the government gives a patent and says that only the patent 

## holder can make or sell the product for a certain period. A patent doesn't necessarily mean that the product is 

## the best, is safe or will work. 

## "Clinically shown." This phrase means that the product was tested on patients as part of a study to see if the 

## product worked. There are many ways to conduct studies. However, if the people doing the study don't follow 

## strict scientific rules for doing research, the study results may have little meaning. 

## Good science: what to look for 

## Scientific studies require careful planning. Researchers need to follow specific procedures and processes. Studies 

## must follow certain rules to be considered scientifically credible, including the following: 

## The testing must take place in carefully controlled conditions. Researchers have to make sure to control 

## factors that could affect the results. For example, if researchers want to know how a medicine affects a child, they 

## have to make sure the child isn't taking any other medicines at the same time. 

## Researchers need to determine how many people should be included in the study. Study size varies according to 

## the kind of study and number of people needed to demonstrate an effect. 

## The group of people receiving treatment should be compared to a control group to truly test if the treatment 

## has any effect. A control group doesn't receive the new treatment, but instead may be given a placebo (sugar pill) 

## or an alternative treatment. 


#### Good clinical studies should be replicated. That means other researchers should be able to do the same study 

#### again using different subjects and get similar results.We know we can trust the findings when different studies 

#### come to the same conclusions. 

#### Well-done, scientifically sound studies should go through peer review. This means other experts on the topic 

#### being studied should review each study and make sure that all proper scientific standards were met. 

## Questioning your sources 

#### Ask these questions when evaluating a health information: 

### 1. What is the source? 

#### In general, sources you can trust include accredited medical schools, government agencies, professional medical 

#### associations, and recognized national disorder/disease-specific organizations. However, don't rely mainly on the name 

#### of the organization—do your own research. 

#### The last 3 letters in a website address can tell you what type of organization or company set up the site. 

#### .gov —Government websites often provide large amounts of information for the general public. 

#### .org —Nonprofit organization websites may contain useful information. However, not all organizations put out 

#### reliable materials. Search for information on nonprofit websites that you have heard of and have good 

#### reputations. 

#### .edu —Academic or education-based websites may have educational materials for parents. 

#### .com —Commercial websites often are designed to sell you something. They are not necessarily a source of 

#### reliable information. 

### 2. Who is the expert? 

#### The doctors or researchers being interviewed may sound like experts, but what are their credentials? What expertise 

#### and experience do they have? They may be doctors, but are they experts on the particular issue being talked about? 

#### Are there conflicts of interest? Are they working for a company that may benefit from their "expert" support? Are they 

#### being paid for their support of a product? If so, this could influence what information these experts choose to share. 

### 3. What are the facts? 

#### Know the difference between preliminary and confirmed findings. A "breakthrough" finding may seem promising. 

#### But it still needs to be replicated and reviewed over time. Don't let a headline make you think that "new study" is the 

#### same as "proven." Another word of caution: "new" doesn't mean improved. Sometimes newer medicines are not an 

#### improvement over older medicines and cost much more. 

## Evaluating new treatments or medicines 

#### When you come across a new treatment (/English/health-issues/conditions/treatments/Pages/default.aspx) or 

#### medicine, ask yourself the following questions: 

### 1. Will it work for my child? 

#### Be suspicious if the information describing the treatment or medicine: 

#### Claims it will work for everyone. 

#### Uses a story about one person's experience or testimonials as proof that it works. 

#### Cites only one study as proof. 

#### Cites a study without a control (comparison) group. 

### 2. How safe is it? 

#### Be suspicious if the treatment or medicine: 

#### Comes without directions for proper use. 

#### Doesn't list contents or ingredients. 

#### Has no information or warnings about side effects. 

##### Back to Top 


#### Is described as "harmless" or "natural." Remember, most medication is made from natural sources. A "natural" 

#### treatment doesn't necessarily work and, worse yet, actually may be harmful to your child. Being "natural" does 

#### not necessarily mean it is good or safe. 

#### Isn't approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 

#### Appears on an infomercial. 

### 3. How is it promoted? 

#### Be suspicious if the ad for the treatment or medicine: 

#### Claims it's based on a secret formula. 

#### Claims it works immediately and permanently. 

#### Claims it's a "miraculous" or an "amazing" breakthrough. 

#### Claims it is a "cure." 

#### Says it's available from only one source. 

## Remember 

#### The internet can be a valuable source of medical information and advice, but you can't trust everything you read. The 

#### internet also is the source of a lot of health-related theories and opinions that haven't been proven. 

#### Make sure that your pediatrician (/English/ages-stages/prenatal/decisions-to-make/Pages/finding-a

#### pediatrician.aspx) knows about your questions and concerns; share the information you've found. You and your 

#### pediatrician are partners in your child's health.
