# Developmental Milestones: 3 Months 

## What are some of the developmental milestones my 

## child should reach by three months of age? 

## By the time your baby is three months of age, she will have made a dramatic transformation from 

## a totally dependent newborn to an active and responsive infant. She’ll lose many of her newborn 

## reflexes while acquiring more voluntary control of her body. You’ll find her spending hours 

## inspecting her hands and watching their movements. 

## Here are some other milestones to look for. 

## Movement Milestones 

## Raises head and chest when lying on stomach 

## Supports upper body with arms when lying on stomach 

## Stretches legs out and kicks when lying on stomach or back 

## Opens and shuts hands 

## Pushes down on legs when feet are placed on a firm surface 

## Brings hand to mouth 

## Takes swipes at dangling objects with hands 

## Grasps and shakes hand toys 

## Visual and Hearing Milestones 

## Watches faces intently 

## Follows moving objects 

## Recognizes familiar objects and people at a distance 

## Starts using hands and eyes in coordination 

## Smiles (/English/ages-stages/baby/pages/Your-Babys-First-Smile.aspx) at the sound of your voice 

## Begins to babble 

## Begins to imitate some sounds (/English/ages-stages/baby/pages/Hearing-and-Making-Sounds.aspx) 

## Turns head toward direction of sound 

## Social and Emotional Milestones 

## Begins to develop a social smile 

## Enjoys playing with other people and may cry when playing stops 

## Becomes more communicative (/English/ages-stages/baby/pages/Emotional-and-Social-Development-Birth-to

## 3-Months.aspx) and expressive with face and body 

## Imitates some movements and facial expressions 

## Developmental Health Watch 

## Although each baby develops in her own individual way and at her own rate, failure to reach certain milestones may 

## signal medical or developmental problems requiring special attention. If you notice any of the following warning 

## signs in your infant at this age, discuss them with your pediatrician. 

## Doesn’t seem to respond to loud sounds 

## Doesn’t notice her hands by two months 

## Doesn’t smile at the sound of your voice by two months 

## Doesn’t follow moving objects with her eyes by two to three months
