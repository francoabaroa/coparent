# Toilet Training and the Older Child 

## “My husband likes to tease me by calling my parenting style the ‘lazy parent’s method’ for raising a child,” writes one 

## mother. “I like to just wait for my son to move on to the next stage of development and then follow his lead. He toilet

## trained himself when he was four because he wanted to—not because I decided it was time.” 

## Such a relaxed attitude toward toilet training has grown somewhat more common in this country in recent years, 

## though many parents continue to report surprised reactions from others who learn that their preschool-age children 

## are still in diapers. Your older child—age three and a half and up—may not be potty-trained for a variety of reasons. 

## You may have decided to delay training until your child expressed an interest. You may have attempted toilet training 

## at an earlier time, only to give up when you met with resistance. Your child may have been fully trained but then 

## regressed when a new sibling arrived or another major change occurred, causing him never to return to his toilet

## using routine. Or your toddler or preschooler may have experienced physical or developmental challenges that 

## interfered with bladder or bowel control. 

## If your child has recently tried and failed to master the toilet-training process, or has never responded to your 

## attempts to begin, it’s a good idea to schedule a checkup with his pediatrician before beginning training at this time. 

## An examination can identify such common, treatable obstacles to toilet training as a bladder infection or bowel 

## problems. Your pediatrician can also explain how to compensate for physical or mental disabilities or developmental 

## challenges. Whether a physical or other problem is confirmed or ruled out, a visit to the pediatrician will give you a 

## better understanding of how to work with your child and will help you and your child proceed with greater 

## confidence. 

## Toilet training a healthy older child can offer some advantages over training a toddler. Preschoolers’ improved ability 

## to visualize a goal and achieve it, increased skill at communicating any confusion, anxiety, or resentment they may 

## feel, and greater awareness of other children’s behavior all work together to promote a smoother and faster transition. 

## Yet these same developments can also present new challenges. A child’s ability to act on his own spurs resistance to a 

## parent’s directions. A preschooler’s improved verbal skills allow him to argue and negotiate. His awareness of other 

## children’s behavior may backfire if he feels ashamed of his continued diaper use. The simple force of long habit can 

## also make it more difficult to achieve the transition out of diapers. 

## In most cases, parents find that toilet training an older child is neither easier nor more difficult than training a toddler 

## —just different. There are unique challenges and opportunities you are likely to experience with your preschooler or 

## older child.
