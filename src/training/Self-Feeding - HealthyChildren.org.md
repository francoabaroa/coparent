# Self-Feeding 

## At twelve months, your baby was just getting used to drinking from a cup and feeding himself 

## with a spoon and his fingers. By fifteen months, he’ll be much more in control, getting food into 

## his mouth with relative ease when he wants to and flinging it about the room when that seems 

## like more fun. He’ll be able to fill his spoon and get it to his mouth consistently, although 

## occasionally it will tip the wrong way and spill at the last second. 

## Unbreakable dishes, cups, and glasses are essential, since they, too, may go flying when he’s bored 

## with their contents. Such behavior should be discouraged by a firm reprimand and replacement 

## of the utensils in the proper location. If these behaviors persist, consider taking him out of the 

## high chair and waiting until the next meal. 

## By eighteen months, your toddler can use a spoon, fork, and unbreakable glass or cup when he wants to, but he may 

## not always want to. There will be times when he’d rather finger paint with his pudding or turn his plate into a soaring 

## airplane. 

## Some children get over this chaotic eating behavior by their second birthday, at which time they actually may become 

## upset when they spill or get even a little smudge of food on their hands. Others, however, will remain very messy 

## eaters well into their third year.
