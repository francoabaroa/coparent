# A Word on Wipes 

## By Laura A. Jana, MD, FAAP and Jennifer Shu, MD, FAAP 

## Although we haven't officially counted, there have to be 

## about as many brands and types of baby wipes as there 

## are tennis shoes—environmentally friendly, all-natural, 

## scented and unscented, with aloe and without it, in 

## round containers, in refillable rectangular containers, 

## and in reusable or disposable travel packs. And while 

## they may cost only a few cents a wipe if you don't go for 

## the top of the line or opt for fancy packaging, the cost 

## can still add up. 

## Here are a some points to consider when buying and 

## using baby wipes: 

## Packaging. After one look at the shelves, you won't need us to tell you that when it comes to buying wipes, you 

## pay for packaging. However, doing so is not always a bad thing. For example, someone who clearly had firsthand 

## experience in the use of wipes on the go must have come up with the handy little travel-sized packs, and many 

## parents find the added convenience well worth the extra money. That said, it is useful to hang on to reusable 

## plastic travel containers and full-sized refillable plastic containers. By simply buying large refill packs and 

## restocking them yourself, you can save the extra expense. 

## Don't flush 'em. Enough said—almost. There are very few wipes on the market that don't have the potential to 

## wreak havoc on your plumbing. Be sure to check package labels before buying if you are determined to find 

## wipes that are flushable because most of them are not. Even then, seasoned plumbers will tell you that despite 

## their name, the flushable ones still have the unfortunate tendency to get stuck. 

## Warm 'em? Some people are convinced that warm wipes are less shocking to a baby's skin. It sounds reasonable: 

## given that a baby's body temperature is 98.6°F and regular damp wipes are roughly 60°F, we're talking about a 

## 40°F difference. There are many options when it comes to choosing a wipe-warming unit—AC power adapter 

## and/or car charger, heat from the top or heat from the sides, a constant 104°F wipe temperature inside the unit, 

## built-in nightlights, and more. Realistically speaking, though, most babies are not afforded this luxury and get 

## used to cool wipes right from the start. 

## The overuse of wipes. Believe it or not, not every diaper change requires the use of wipes. This is not only 

## because pee is rarely irritating but also because today's superabsorbent disposable diapers effectively limit the 

## amount of pee that comes into contact with your baby's skin. Reserving wipes for cleaning up poop can save you 

## a considerable amount. Also, keep in mind that a moist tissue, a wet washcloth, or even a quick rinse in the tub 

## may be used in place of baby wipes when convenient.
