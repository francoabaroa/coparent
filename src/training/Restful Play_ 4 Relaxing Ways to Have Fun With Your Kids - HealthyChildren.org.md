## play/Pages/playing-outside-why-its-important-for-kids.aspx) more. Running around at the local playground, playing 

## catch, hopscotch or jumping rope are just a few examples of ways to have fun while getting the exercise kids need each 

## day. But summer is also a great time to enjoy some rest and relaxation as a family, with a playful spin. 

## aRead on for a few ideas to mash up play and rest together this summer. Leave your phones and other devices pinging 

## for your attention inside. Then sit back and focus on enjoying each other while and the world around us while 

## revitalizing our minds and bodies. 

## Listening to your kids 

## Try to turn off the non-stop to-do list in every parent's brain, and just let go and follow the stream-of

## consciousness, non-linear, and outside-the-box thinking that kids' minds do. Sometimes just asking 

## "What if..." questions (the more outlandish, the better) can spark surprising and delightful conversations. 

## Some inspiration: 

## What if a genie granted you three wishes? (Try adding this: And you had to use them to help 

## someone else?) 

## What if you could be an animal for a day? What would you be and do? 

## What if your toys could talk? What would they say? 

## Getting on the ground 


### Lying on the earth is, literally, "grounding"—a term used to describe organizing our minds and bodies. 

### This could involve looking up close at grains of sand and blades of grass. Taking note of muffled sounds 

### and different smells. Try to join in playful ways of thinking with your kids while you lay there: what does 

### the world look like to a bug? 

## Reading outside 

### Reading outside can be relaxing ways to develop strong emotional bonds while enjoying the outdoors. 

### Grab a blanket and a few books and find a shady spot for outdoor story time. Ideally, bring along books 

### that are set outside so you can help your child make connections: "Oh, look, a picture of a cloud. Let's look 

### up in the sky to find a cloud!" 

## Watching for feathered friends

### Put up a birdfeeder and enjoy watching the wildlife it attracts to your window or yard. Count how many 

### different types of visitors you have. If you have binoculars, get a closer look at others on nearby perches. 

### For birds you can hear but can’t see, try to guess where they are. For extra fun, try to make the same 

### sounds they do with their calls and songs.
