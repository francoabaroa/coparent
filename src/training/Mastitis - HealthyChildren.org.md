# Mastitis 

## When an area of the breast does not drain sufficiently, bacteria may begin to grow in that area 

## and cause an infection, a condition called mastitis. 

## Symptoms of mastitis include swelling, burning, redness, or pain, and you may have fever, flu-like 

## symptoms, or generalized aches. If you have any of these symptoms, let your doctor know at once. 

## Treatment consists of warm compresses and antibiotics, along with frequent breastfeeding, rest, 

## plenty of fluids, and pain medication. When your doctor prescribes antibiotics for mastitis, it is 

## important to complete the entire prescription amount. Many mothers are concerned about the 

## antibiotic being transmitted in the breast milk and affecting the baby, so they either don’t take the medicine or stop 

## earlier than recommended. The antibiotics given to treat mastitis do not generally cause any problems for the 

## nursing infant, and failure to complete the course may increase your chance of developing another episode of the 

## infection. Repeat or untreated breast infections may cause scarring, which can impact your milk production even with 

## subsequent pregnancies and breastfeeding experiences. 

## It’s important to continue breastfeeding while you have mastitis, since frequent nursing helps drain your breasts and 

## prevents the infection from spreading. Your baby will not be harmed by drinking your breast milk. Sometimes the 

## breast milk may taste “salty” and may be refused by the baby. 

## If it is too painful to have your baby nurse on the infected breast, move him to the other breast and open up both sides 

## of your bra to let milk flow from the sore breast onto a towel or absorbent cloth. Frequently expressing milk from the 

## affected breast with a breast pump will also help relieve the pressure and speed up the healing process. Milk must be 

## removed from the infected breast either by the baby or with a pump.
