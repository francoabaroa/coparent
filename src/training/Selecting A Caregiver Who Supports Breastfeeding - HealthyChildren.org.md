# Selecting A Caregiver Who Supports Breastfeeding 

## Once you have a good idea what to expect from your employer, it’s time to consider who will care 

## for your baby while you work. If you can arrange for child care at or near your office, you may be 

## able to breastfeed even after you return to your job by visiting your baby during breaks. Whether 

## you plan to breastfeed during work hours or have the caregiver feed your milk to your baby, be 

## sure to select a caregiver or child care program that supports breastfeeding and will follow your 

## instructions for handling and feeding of your milk. 

## Discuss such topics as what to do about your baby’s resistance to a cup or bottle, whether to delay 

## a feeding if you are due to arrive soon, and so on; be sure that your philosophy melds easily with 

## the caregiver’s intentions or the center’s policies. At least once before you start back to work, leave your baby with the 

## caregiver for a period of several hours that includes a feeding. In this way you can work out some of the kinks in the 

## system that might otherwise prove discouraging later. 

## Issues to Discuss with a Potential Caregiver 

## No parent wants to change caregivers once a relationship has been established. To ensure that your caregiver is the 

## right choice for you and your baby—and that she will help you maintain your breastfeeding relationship with your 

## child as you return to work—discuss the following issues with her ahead of time: 

## Her willingness to feed your baby expressed milk 

## How to handle and store your milk 

## How your baby prefers to be held for a bottle-feeding 

## How to cope with resistance to the bottle 

## How to comfort your baby when he’s upset 

## Whether she feels comfortable delaying a bottle-feeding if you’ll arrive soon and can breastfeed 

## What to do if you’re late picking up your baby 

## Your baby’s eating, sleeping, elimination, and behavior patterns
