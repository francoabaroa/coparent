# Movement Milestones: Birth to 3 Months 

## By: Courtney J. Wusthoff, MD, MS, FAAP 

## The first weeks and months of a baby's life are a period 

## of amazing development. New skills and movements 

## form quickly. These movement milestones are often 

## called "motor development 

## (/English/MotorDelay/Pages/default.aspx);" they are a 

## source of delight for babies and their families. 

## Here's an overview of some 

## typical motor milestones to 

## expect from birth to 3 months: 

## Month one 

## Your baby will not be able to control many of her movements during the first few weeks. As she begins to develop 

## more physical abilities, her motions may still be jerky or jittery. But she's learning fast, so hold on! 

## Eyes on you. Did you know one of the first parts of the body a baby can move are her eyes? Newborns can only 

## see about a foot in front of them at first, but that's just enough to move their eyes to gaze at faces near them. Your 

## baby may also look toward familiar sounds (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Hearing-and-Making

## Sounds.aspx) and voices. 

## Neck control. Newborns can move their head to the side. You may see this with their first feeding, when the 

## "rooting" reflex (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Newborn-Reflexes.aspx) prompts them to turn toward the 

## nipple. But infants don't have much neck control the first few weeks. Your baby needs your help to support her 

## head. 

## Newborn reflexes. In addition to rooting, your baby may show other reflex movements these first weeks. To see 

## the step reflex in action, hold your baby securely under his arms (support his head, too!) as his feet touch a flat 

## surface; he may put one foot in front of the other in a sort of "walking" motion. This reflex disappears after the 

## first couple months, and most babies don't take their first "real" steps until about a year old. 

## Month Two 

## Your baby's nervous system has matured some by now. Certain newborn reflexes are beginning to give way to 

## voluntary motions. With improved muscle control, movement becomes more fluid and wigglier. Here's what else you 

## can expect: 

## Heads up on tummy time. Most babies this age can lift their head up when lying on their tummies. Regularly 

## giving your baby some "tummy time (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/The-Importance-of-Tummy

## Time.aspx)" is a great way to help her build strength in her neck and trunk. Some will cry when placed on their 

## tummies, but usually do better after a few tries. It helps to have something interesting, such as mom's face, in 

## front of them so they have encouragement to lift their head. Although too young to actually crawl, your baby may 

## try or begin to push up from a lying position. 

## Hand to mouth. During these weeks, your baby may begin to wave his arms around more when excited. 

## Increasingly, his hands will catch his attention. He may spend a lot of time trying to move them in front of him 

## where he can see them. After many tries, he may be able to move them to his mouth. His finger motion is still 

## limited, though, so his hands will likely still be clenched in tight little fists. Sucking on them may become a way 

## for him to soothe himself. 


#### A tug of the lips. You may have already noticed random facial movements, including reflexive smiles, while your 

#### baby sleeps. But starting sometime around her sixth week, your baby may flash you her first real smile 

#### (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Your-Babys-First-Smile.aspx) in a genuine gesture of affection or amusement. 

### Month Three 

#### Your baby's arm and leg movements continue to become smoother. The "startle" reflex is probably gone by now. She's 

#### becoming stronger and better able to coordinate her motions. 

#### Straightening out. You might notice your baby's whole body now looks more relaxed. His hands will no longer 

#### be balled up in fists all the time. In fact, he may entertain himself by carefully opening and shutting them. He'll 

#### also enjoy more actively kicking his legs, which are straightening out from their pulled-up newborn position. 

#### Ready to roll. As her kicks continue to become more forceful, she may soon be able to kick herself over from her 

#### tummy to back. While most babies can't roll from back to tummy yet, some may begin rolling over at this age. Be 

#### careful never to leave your baby alone on furniture where they could roll over. 

#### Get a grip. Babies this age may begin to swipe at objects hanging just out of reach. While a newborn reflex 

#### causes babies to wrap their fingers around objects that touch the palm, your baby's grasp may now be more 

#### deliberate. She may even be able to hold and shake hand toys. 

#### Let's bounce. When held up and supported in a "standing" position on a surface such as your lap, your baby may 

#### discover the joy of bouncing. This is a fun way to play together as your baby begins to hold some of his weight in 

#### his legs. It's best to avoid leaving babies in bouncer seats 

#### (http://www.aappublications.org/news/2017/10/17/HealthAlerts101717) or harnesses. These can actually slow 

#### your baby's movement progress because they don't let her practice using her muscles as much. 

## When to See Your Pediatrician 

#### Remember, each baby's movements may be a little different. If your baby doesn't master her movements at exactly the 

#### same pace others might, it is usually not because of any developmental delay (/English/ages

#### stages/toddler/Pages/Assessing-Developmental-Delays.aspx) or other problem. 

### It is a good idea to talk with your pediatrician if you notice your baby does any of 

### the following: 

#### Stops doing something she used to do. All babies will have good days and bad days. They may go a few days 

#### before repeating a new skill. But, if your baby's development is going backwards or consistently stopped, talk with 

#### your pediatrician. 

#### Is not using a part or side of the body. Babies this age normally do not show whether they are left or right 

#### handed. If your baby only uses one hand or one side of his body, talk with your pediatrician. 

#### Seems too floppy. Young infants may seem "floppy" until they develop more muscle control. But if your baby 

#### seems especially limp or droopy, it could mean she is sick or has an infection. 

#### Jitters or shakes too much. Many newborns have shaky hands or quivery chins, but if their whole bodies are 

#### shaking, it could signal a medical problem. Call your pediatrician.
