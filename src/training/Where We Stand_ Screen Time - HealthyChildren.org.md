# Where We Stand: Screen Time 

## The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) encourages parents to 

## help their children develop healthy media use habits early on. 

## For children younger than 18 months, use of screen media other 

## than video-chatting should be discouraged. 

## Parents of children 18 to 24 months of age who want to introduce 

## digital media should choose high-quality programming/apps and 

## use them together with children, because this is how toddlers learn 

## best. Letting children use media by themselves should be avoided. 

## For children older than 2 years, media limits are very appropriate. 

## Limit screen use to no more than 1 hour or less per day of high

## quality programming. Co-view or co-play with your children, and find other activities for to do together that are 

## healthy for the body and mind (e.g., reading, teaching, talking, and playing together). 

## All children and teens need adequate sleep (/English/healthy-living/sleep/Pages/Healthy-Sleep-Habits-How-Many

## Hours-Does-Your-Child-Need.aspx) (8-12 hours, depending on age), physical activity (/English/healthy

## living/fitness/Pages/Energy-Out-Daily-Physical-Activity-Recommendations.aspx) (1 hour), and time away from 

## media. Designate media-free times together (e.g., family dinner) and media-free zones (e.g., bedrooms). Children 

## should not sleep with devices in their bedrooms, including TVs, computers, and smartphones. 

## Parents are encouraged to develop personalized media use plans for their children. Media plans should take into 

## account each child's age, health, personality, and developmental stage. Create your Family Media Use Plan here 

## (/English/media/Pages/default.aspx#planview) and remember to communicate your plan to other caregivers, such as 

## babysitters or grandparents, so that media rules are followed consistently.
