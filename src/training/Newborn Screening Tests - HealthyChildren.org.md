# Newborn Screening Tests 

## Shortly after birth, your baby will have screening tests to detect a 

## variety of congenital conditions (/English/health

## issues/conditions/developmental-disabilities/Pages/Congenital

## Abnormalities.aspx). These tests are designed to detect problems 

## early in order to treat them promptly, prevent disabilities, and save 

## lives. 

## Screening Tests 

## There is some variability between states for which tests are offered, 

## but all states examine the baby's blood for metabolic and genetic 

## conditions (/English/ages-stages/prenatal/Pages/Detecting

## Genetic-Abnormalities.aspx). Newborns also have a hearing test (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Purpose-of

## Newborn-Hearing-Screening.aspx) done. A screening for critical congenital heart disease using pulse oximetry 

## (measuring the oxygen in the infant's blood) is now required in the hospital before newborn discharge. 

## Before Baby is Born 

## Before your baby is born, talk to your pediatrician about which screening tests your baby will undergo, including their 

## benefits and any risks, and ask if it is necessary for you to consent to this testing. 

## Test Results 

## Ask when you can find out the test results, and what they mean if your newborn has a result that is out of the normal 

## range. This may not necessarily mean that your baby actually has a congenital or genetic condition, so inquire about 

## whether and when retesting would be done. Also, double-check to make certain the tests are actually performed 

## before your baby leaves the hospital.
