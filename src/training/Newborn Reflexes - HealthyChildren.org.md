# Newborn Reflexes 

## Many of your baby's movements in their first weeks are 

## done by reflex. This means it is involuntary or happens 

## without your baby trying. If you put your finger in their 

## mouth, they suck reflexively. They shut their eyes 

## tightly to a bright light. 

## Some reflexes remain with newborns for months, while 

## others go away in weeks. Here are some you can watch 

## for in your baby: 

## Rooting 

## In some cases, reflexes change into voluntary behavior. 

## For example, your baby is born with a rooting reflex that prompts him to turn his head toward your hand if you stroke 

## his cheek or mouth. This helps him find the nipple at feeding time. At first, he'll root from side to side, turning his head 

## toward the nipple and then away in decreasing arcs. He'll simply move his head and mouth into position to suck. 

## Sucking 

## Sucking is another survival reflex present even before birth. In fact, if you had an ultrasound during pregnancy, you 

## may have seen your baby sucking their thumb. 

## After birth, when a nipple and areola are placed deeply in your baby's mouth, he automatically begins to suck. This 

## motion actually has two stages. First, he places his lips around the areola with the nipple far back in the mouth, 

## pointed to the junction of the hard and soft palate, and compresses the breast between his tongue and palate (called 

## "expression," this action forces the milk out). In the second phase, or milking action, the tongue moves from the areola 

## to the nipple. This whole process is helped by the suction that secures the breast to the baby's mouth. 

## Coordinating these rhythmic sucking movements with breathing and swallowing is a relatively complicated task for a 

## newborn. So even though this is a reflexive action, not all babies suck efficiently at first. With practice, however, the 

## reflex becomes a skill that they all manage well. 

## Rooting, sucking, and bringing his hand to his mouth are considered feeding cues in the first weeks after birth. Later 

## on, after breastfeeding is well established, your baby will start to use these movements to console himself, and may 

## also be comforted by a pacifier or when you help him find his thumb or fingers. 

## Newborn Reflexes 

## The following are some normal inborn reflexes you will see during the first weeks. Not all infants acquire and lose 

## these reflexes at exactly the same time, but this table will give you a general idea of what to expect. 

## Reflex Age When Reflex Appears Age When Reflex Disappears 

## Stepping Birth 2 months 

## Rooting Birth 4 months 

## Palmar grasp Birth 5–6 months

### Moro reflex Birth 2 months 

### Tonic neck reflex Birth 5–7 months 

### Plantar grasp Birth 9–12 months 

## Moro or "startle" reflex 

### A dramatic reflex during these first few weeks is the Moro reflex. If your baby's head shifts position abruptly or falls 

### backward--or if he is startled by something loud or abrupt--he will extend his arms and legs and neck and then rapidly 

### bring his arms together. He may even cry loudly. The Moro reflex, which is present in varying degrees in different 

### babies, usually peaks during the first month and starts to disappear after about two months. 

## Tonic neck reflex or "fencing" posture 

### A more interesting automatic response is the tonic neck reflex, or the fencing posture. You may notice that when your 

### baby's head turns to one side, his corresponding arm will straighten, with the opposite arm bent, as if he's fencing. You 

### may not see this response, however, since it is subtle, and if your baby is disturbed or crying, he may not perform it. It 

### disappears at five to seven months of age. 

### Both the Moro and tonic neck reflexes should be present equally on both sides of the body. If you note that the reflex 

### seems different on one side, or that the baby moves one side of the body better than the other, tell your pediatrician. 

## Grasping 

### You'll see still another reflex when you stroke your baby's palm and watch him immediately grip your finger. Or, if you 

### stroke the sole of his foot, you can watch his toes curl tightly. In the first few days after birth, your baby's grasp will be 

### so strong it may seem he can hold his own weight—but don't try it. He has no control over this response and may let go 

### suddenly. 

## Stepping 

### Aside from strength, your baby's other special talent is stepping. He can't support his weight, of course, but if you hold 

### him under the arms (being careful to support his head as well) and let his soles touch a flat surface, he'll place one foot 

### in front of the other and "walk." 

### This reflex will help a newborn crawl to the breast right after delivery when lying on their mother's abdomen. This 

### reflex will disappear after two months, then show up again toward the end of the first year as the learned behavior of 

### walking.
