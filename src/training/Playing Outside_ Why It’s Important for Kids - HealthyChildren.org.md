# Playing Outside: Why It’s Important for Kids 

## By: Danette Glassy, MD, FAAP & Pooja Tandon, MD, FAAP 

## No matter what the weather brings, playing outside is 

## good for kids. There is scientific evidence that playing 

## outside improves health, and children of all ages love it. 

## Even as the COVID-19 virus continues to spread, 

## outdoor time and nature exploration are safe for most 

## kids. And we know that the more time a child spends in 

## nature, the more likely they are to grow up to be good

## Nature is all around us. We don't necessarily need to travel far to enjoy nature. Your family can connect with nature 

## in a school playground, backyard, table-top garden, or even virtually 

## (https://www.nationalparks.org/connect/blog/take-virtual-visit-national-park) (though not with all of the benefits). 

## There are also many ways to find out what parks are nearby (https://findyourpark.com/park-finder) based on zip code, 

## including some that you can get to by walking (https://www.nrpa.org/our-work/park-path-app/) or taking public 

## transportation (https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/sponsored-content/leki/8-public-transit-accessible-wilderness

## adventures). Many public green spaces have features and programs for all ages and abilities. 

## Read on for ways that you and your children can get a physical and emotional boost from playing outside and 

## spending time in nature. 

## Playing outside & exploring nature is for all ages 

## Bringing baby outside. The earlier you share nature with your baby, the more likely they are to develop a life-long 

## love of the outdoors. Even infants and toddlers can play and learn in nature. Take a walk through the trees using a 

## carrier (/English/safety-prevention/on-the-go/Pages/Baby-Carriers.aspx) or stroller. Throw down a blanket on the 

## grass or soft earth. Let your baby enjoy the fresh breezes, bird songs, forest smells and plant textures. Give them some 

## outside tummy time (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/back-to-sleep-tummy-to-play.aspx), blowing bubbles for 

## them to reach for and watch glisten in the sun. 

## Explore with preschoolers and younger children. Young children are developing and learning from every 

## experience. 

## Build nature sculptures with twigs, leaves, cones, rocks and more by sticking the collected items into a play 

## dough base. Ask your child what kind of patterns they see with the different items. Or, let your child play in mud 

## with old pots, pans, utensils and household tools to develop senses and motor skills. 

## Bike or walk with the family in your neighborhood or find a new park to explore. If you have a bicycle trailer 

## (/English/safety-prevention/at-play/Pages/baby-on-board-keeping-safe-on-a-bike.aspx) or your child is able to 

## bike, get some exercise while enjoying the outdoors. Describe what you see along the way and talk about the 

## weather. Use a lot of details to help them learn new words and engage all their senses. 

## Take story time outside. Grab a blanket, some books and find a shady spot to read (/English/ages

## stages/gradeschool/school/Pages/Help-Your-Child-Enjoy-Reading-Aloud-Tips-for-Parents.aspx) with your child 

## outdoors. Pick books that talk about nature and help your child make connections. 

## Outdoor playdates. Meet up with friends outdoors to build social connections for both children and adults. 

## Challenge older children & teens. Stay engaged with the outdoors as a family. Take advantage of this time to bond 

## over games and activities you all enjoy or challenge yourselves with something new. 


### Hold a nature scavenger hunt or start a nature collection. Look for local plants, trees, animals and birds. 

### Collect rocks, acorns, leaves or pinecones. See how many items children can find on a list, or gather objects to 

### add to a collection. 

### Leave a trail. Organize with parents of your children's friends to send kids on "secret spy missions." One family 

### goes on a walk with sidewalk chalk, drawing arrows and letters along the way to spell out a secret message. The 

### other family must then follow the arrows along the way to record the letters in the message. 

### Have a ball. Kicking a soccer ball, throwing a frisbee, jumping rope or playing any sports you all enjoy can keep 

### the outdoors fun as children get older. 

### Pack a picnic or plan a barbeque outside with friends and family. Share a meal, take a walk or play a game 

### together while you enjoy the outdoors. 

## Healthy benefits of outdoor play 

### Getting outside provides more than a fun break for children and teenagers. It is also good for their physical and 

### mental health and development. Children and teens who spend time playing outside and enjoying nature can be: 

### Physically healthier. Children play (/English/ages-stages/toddler/fitness/Pages/Caution-Children-at-Play.aspx) 

### harder outdoors than indoors and they need daily opportunities to do so. More outdoor time is linked with 

### improved motor development and lower obesity rates and myopia (/English/health

### issues/conditions/eyes/Pages/Myopia-Nearsightedness.aspx) (nearsightedness) risk. Safely (/English/safety

### prevention/at-play/Pages/Sun-Safety-and-Protection-Tips.aspx) getting some sun also helps us make vitamin D 

### that our bodies need to stay healthy and strong. 

### More engaged in learning. Playing outside promotes curiosity, creativity and critical thinking. Studies have 

### found that children who spent more time in nature exploration had improved learning outcomes. 

### More positive in behavior. Research shows that when children spent time in natural settings they had less 

### anger and aggression (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/communication-discipline/Pages/Disciplining

### Your-Child.aspx). Impulse control also improves. This might be especially important when normal routines 

### change for children. 

### Mentally healthier. Stress and depression are lower for all people who spend time in nature. Children show 

### increased focus and reduced symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (/English/health

### issues/conditions/adhd/Pages/default.aspx). 

## Remember 

### Take advantage of the healing power of play (/English/our-mission/aap-in-action/Pages/Power-of-Play-An-Alliance

### with-Melissa-and-Doug.aspx) in nature—near your home or neighborhood, or wherever you feel comfortable. 

### Remember to dress appropriately for the weather. It's also a good idea to wash hands (/English/health

### issues/conditions/prevention/Pages/Hand-Washing-A-Powerful-Antidote-to-Illness.aspx) or use hand sanitizer 

### (/English/health-issues/conditions/COVID-19/Pages/Keep-Hand-Sanitizer-Out-of-Childrens-Reach.aspx) during and 

### after your adventure. 

### Finally, ask community leaders to ensure all kids have safe places to play outside. Getting outdoors, being in nature, 

### and moving our bodies is good for everyone!
