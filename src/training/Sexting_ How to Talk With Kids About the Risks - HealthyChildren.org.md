# Sexting: How to Talk With Kids About the Risks 

## By: Yolanda (Linda) Reid Chassiakos, MD, FAAP 

## Sexting is the sending or receiving of sexually explicit 

## images, videos or text messages using a smartphone, 

## computer, tablet, video game or digital camera. It's not 

## something any parent wants to think about their child 

## doing, and it may be uncomfortable to talk about. But 

## the fact is that sexting is something kids will find out 

## about at some point. This is why it's important to talk 

## about sexting with your child early, so they have the 

## information they need to make healthy decisions. 

## How common is sexting? 

## There has been a significant jump in the number of kids and teens with access to smartphones. According to a 2021 

## Common Sense Media survey (https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/8-18-census

## integrated-report-final-web_0.pdf), an estimated 88% of 13to 18-year-olds and 43% of 8to 12-year-olds have 

## smartphones. 

## It's not too surprising then that sexting is more common among kids and teens these days. A 2021 study 

## (https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(21)00558-9/fulltext) on sexting among youth found these statistics: 

## 19.3% had sent a sext 

## 34.8% had received a sext 

## 14.5% had forwarded a sext without consent 

## Females receive more sexts than males 

## Older teens are more likely to send sexts 

## Older and younger adolescents receive sexts at around the same rate 

## Risks of sexting 

## While sexting has become more normalized among young people, there are many risks involved for kids and teens. 

## These include: 

## Mental health and sexual behavior 

## There are mental health risk factors and sexual behaviors linked with kids and teens who sext, compared to those that 

## don't. Young people who sext are more likely to: 

## Have depression and/or anxiety 

## Commit minor crimes 

## Use alcohol, drugs or cigarettes 

## Engage in sexual activity and sex with multiple partners 

## Not use contraception 


##### Younger adolescents who sext may be even more susceptible to these risks because of their lack of experience and 

##### immaturity. They also tend to be more vulnerable to digital dangers such as bullying or "sextortion." This is a type of 

##### blackmail used to get people to send sexually explicit photos or money so that their private information isn't posted 

##### online. 

### Legal risks 

##### There's also the potential legal trouble kids can get into, whether they're sending or receiving sexts. Some states 

##### (https://cyberbullying.org/sexting-laws) will even prosecute minors with a felony charge, which can mean up to 20 

##### years in prison. Minors may also be permanently placed on sex offender lists. 

### Other risks 

##### There are other risks with sexting too, risks that young people may not think about, including: 

##### You don't have any control over the video or picture once it's sent. Even people you trust may forward it to others. 

##### You could be bullied by peers who see the sext. 

##### You may regret sending a sext, especially if it's shared with others. You may feel humiliation or embarrassment. 

##### This can lead to serious emotional distress. 

##### If your video or picture is posted online, you are vulnerable to attention you don't want from others, perhaps even 

##### predators. 

## When & how to discuss sexting with your kids 

##### Just as you'd have "the sex talk (/English/ages-stages/teen/dating-sex/Pages/Adolescent-Sexuality-Talk-the-Talk

##### Before-They-Walk-the-Walk.aspx)," you should also should start the conversation about sexting before a problem 

##### develops. It's best to talk to your child as soon they are old enough to have a cell phone (/English/family

##### life/Media/Pages/cell-phones-whats-the-right-age-to-start.aspx). Keep giving age-appropriate guidance as your child 

##### or teen matures. Some tips: 

##### Start the discussion—even if you don't think sexting has affected your child or your community. Ask your 

##### child if they've heard of sexting and what they think it is. It's important to first learn what your child's 

##### understanding is of the issue. After that, you can add age-appropriate information as needed. 

##### Use examples that fit your child's age when giving them information and guidance. For younger children 

##### with cell phones who may know little about sex, let them know that text messages should never contain pictures 

##### or videos of people—kids or adults—without their clothes on, engaged in extended kissing or touching private 

##### parts. For older children, use the term "sexting" and ask if they've been exposed to nude or seminude images or 

##### sexual activities such as "making out"—or more. 

##### Be very specific—especially with teens—that sexting often involves pictures or videos of a sexual nature, 

##### including nude and seminude photos and sexual activities. Some sexts can be considered pornography or 

##### child pornography. Depending on the state, both senders and receivers could be charged and prosecuted. 

##### Make sure kids of all ages understand that sexting is serious and considered a crime in many 

##### jurisdictions. There can be serious consequences for sexting, quite possibly involving the police. Teens may be 

##### suspended from school and have labels on their permanent record that could hurt their chances of getting into 

##### college or getting a job. 

##### Inform your children that texts, images and videos on the internet can remain there forever. This is true 

##### even if they're posted on apps that "delete" after a short duration. Receivers can also share these posts with 

##### others, often without the consent of the sexter, and some can even "go viral." Sexters who may have intended their 

##### sexts to be viewed by only one individual may find that their photos have been seen by everyone at school after a 

##### break-up with a formerly loyal friend. Help your teen resist peer pressure and protect themselves by saying no to 

##### sexting—and no to sharing any sexts viewed or received. 

##### Monitor headlines and the news for stories about sexting that show the very real consequences for both 

#### senders and receivers. "Have you seen this story?" "What did you think about it?" "What would you do if you 

#### were this child?" Practice ways for your child to respond if they are asked to participate in inappropriate texting. 

##### Encourage your child to come to you with concerns or worries about sexting. 

##### Be on the lookout for excessive texting. This is associated with an increased likelihood of sending and 

##### receiving sexts. If you suspect inappropriate behavior, monitor your child's cell phone and talk with them about

##### who they're communicating with. 

##### Teach your kids and teens digital citizenship. This includes respect for others and themselves and how to 

##### reject cyberbullying (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/Cyberbullying.aspx). Invite and welcome your children's 

##### questions and conversations. Help them be safe and kind online. 

## Talk with your pediatrician 

##### Your pediatrician can help you and your children approach and discuss this important issue. You can also encourage 

##### school and local community groups to educate parents, teachers and students about the risks of sexting.
