# Dental Sealants for Children 

## Sealants are a fast and easy way of protecting your child’s teeth that act as barriers to cavity

## prone areas. They are usually applied to the chewing surfaces of back teeth and sometimes used 

## to cover deep pits and grooves. Both primary and permanent teeth can benefit from sealants. 

## Toothbrushes Cannot Reach Everything 

## Thorough brushing and flossing help remove food particles and plaque from smooth surfaces of 

## teeth. But toothbrush bristles cannot reach all the way into the depressions and grooves to extract 

## food and plaque. Sealants protect these vulnerable areas by "sealing out" plaque and food. 

## About Sealants 

## Sealants are easy for your dentist to apply. The sealant is painted onto the tooth enamel, where it bonds directly to the 

## tooth and hardens. This plastic resin bonds into the depressions and grooves (pits and fissures) of the chewing 

## surfaces of back teeth. The sealant acts as a barrier, protecting enamel from plaque and acids. As long as the sealant 

## remains intact, the tooth surface will be protected from decay (/English/healthy-living/oral-health/Pages/Preventing

## Tooth-Decay-in-Children.aspx). Sealants hold up well under the force of normal chewing and may last several years 

## before a reapplication is needed. During your regular dental visits, your dentist (/English/family-life/health

## management/pediatric-specialists/Pages/What-is-a-Pediatric-Dentist.aspx) will check the condition of the sealants 

## and reapply them when necessary. 

## The likelihood of developing pit and fissure decay begins early in life, so children and teenagers are obvious 

## candidates. But adults can benefit from sealants as well. 

## Key Ingredients in Preventing Tooth Decay and Maintaining a 

## Healthy Mouth: 

## Brushing twice a day with an ADA-accepted fluoride toothpaste 

## Cleaning between the teeth daily with floss or another interdental cleaner 

## Eating a balanced diet and limiting snacks 

## Visiting your dentist regularly 

## Ask your dentist about whether sealants will help your child.
