# Dental Health and Orthodontic Problems 

## Dental Health 

## Twin studies conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that the average 

## U.S. adolescent of the 1970s had six or seven cavities; his 1990s counterpart, just three. Today’s 

## teenagers are twice as likely to return from the dentist and report, “Look, Ma, no cavities!”—to 

## quote a famous toothpaste commercial of yesteryear. 

## Dr. Jim Steiner, director of pediatric dentistry at Children’s Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio, attributes 

## the improvement in young people’s dental health primarily to increased access to fluoridation. 

## “Fluoride reduces tooth decay as well as slows down the decaying process,” he explains. “More than 95 percent of all 

## toothpastes now have fluoride in them, and about 65 percent of our population drinks fluoridated water.” 

## A related advance is the use of dental sealants, clear or white thin plastic coatings that can be painted onto permanent 

## teeth. As Dr. Steiner explains, “Fluoride protects the areas between the teeth. But it can’t always reach the chewing 

## surfaces of the back molars.” Sealants fill the tiny pits and grooves of those teeth, the site of most cavities. Second 

## molars typically arrive around age twelve. One sealant application costs roughly half the price of a filling. 

## Teens who do develop cavities have less reason to dread the dentist’s chair than you might have when you were their 

## age. New dental instruments such as the laser and the air abrasion unit make getting fillings virtually painless. Laser 

## therapy doesn’t require anesthesia. Nor do many treatments with the air abrasion handpiece, which resembles a tiny 

## sandblaster. However, the devices can’t be used in all situations, so don’t expect to see the high-speed drill become 

## obsolete anytime soon. 

## Another advance of interest to young patients is cosmetic. Beside the traditional silver-colored metal alloy used to fill 

## cavities, a composite material can be used so that the color can be tinted to match the teeth. 

## Orthodontic Problems 

## Crooked teeth, overbites and underbites are best corrected with braces during puberty, while the facial bones are still 

## growing. These are usually inherited traits, although some orthodontic problems stem from injuries, years of thumb

## sucking or losing one’s baby teeth earlier or later than normal. 

## How Orthodontic Problems Are Diagnosed 

## Oral examination and thorough medical/dental history 

## X rays of mouth and head 

## Photos of face and teeth 

## Plaster models of the teeth are made 

## How Orthodontic Problems are Treated 

## If you were a “metal mouth” as a teenager, you’ll immediately notice that modern dental appliances are less 

## conspicuous than the braces you wore. “Years ago,” says Dr. Jim Steiner, director of pediatric dentistry at Children's 

## Hospital in cincinnati, Ohio, “the silver bands that hold the wires had to be placed around all the teeth. That’s no 

## longer done. Nowadays we might band only the first and second molars, and bond brackets directly to the rest of the 

## teeth.” The brackets can be colored to match the teeth. They also come in a clear material, as well as metal. Some 

## patients may be candidates for “invisible braces,” which are worn on the inside of the teeth. 

## On average, youngsters can expect to wear the appliances for about two years. During that time, they return to the 

## orthodontist on a monthly basis. The doctor will usually tighten the wires at these appointments, in order to increase 

## the tension on the teeth. Any discomfort or soreness afterward can usually be alleviated with an over-the-counter 

## pain reliever.

## When braces alone aren’t sufficient to straighten the teeth, a child may have to wear a night brace to bed, to apply 

### pressure externally. Two prongs on the headgear are inserted into a pair of cylinder-shaped metal receptacles 

### constructed on the outer surface of the back molars. Then an elastic band wraps around the back of the head to keep 

### the apparatus in place. Understandably, teens usually aren’t too happy about having to put on the night brace, but 

### parents can reassure them that this is a temporary measure. 

## After the orthodontist removes the braces, the young person is given a removable retainer to wear for the next six to 

### twelve months in order to maintain the alignment of the teeth. The simple device consists of a metal wire attached to 

### a plastic plate that has been conformed to fit against the roof of the mouth.
