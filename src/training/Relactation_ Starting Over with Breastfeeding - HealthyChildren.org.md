# Relactation: Starting Over with Breastfeeding 

## The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends 

## human breastmilk as the sole source of nutrition for a 

## baby's first 6 months, and continued breastfeeding 

## (/English/ages

## stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Where-We-Stand

## Breastfeeding.aspx) after solids (/English/ages

## stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Starting-Solid

## Foods.aspx) are added to the diet for as long as the 

## mother and baby desire it. If you decided against 

## breastfeeding at first, or had breastfeeding challenges 

## that led you to wean your baby earlier than you hoped, 

## it is sometimes possible to begin again. This is called 

## relactation. 

## Even if the goal is not to completely nourish your child with breastmilk, relactation can at least let you maintain the 

## breastfeeding relationship. This may be especially important if you stopped breastfeeding only to find that your baby 

## did not tolerate infant formulas. Read on for more information. 

## When does relactation work best? 

## Relactation works best if you either gave birth fairly recently (particularly if your child is less than three months old) 

## or if your milk supply has been low or nonexistent for only a short period of time. While doctors may prescribe such 

## drugs as metoclopramide to adoptive mothers who have not previously breastfed or to women attempting to relactate, 

## the baby's frequent suckling and other forms of nipple stimulation, such as an electric breast pump, are critical to 

## establishing or reestablishing milk supply. 

## Tips to help restart lactation 

## If you are attempting to relactate, nurse your baby frequently, whenever they show signs of hunger. Hunger cues 

## (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Is-Your-Baby-Hungry-or-Full-Responsive-Feeding

## Explained.aspx) may include a pursed mouth, sucking motions, or increased activity or alertness. You may need to 

## nurse 8 to 10 or even more times per day, with 2 or more night feedings, for about 15 to 20 minutes per session. If your 

## baby is not eager to nurse as you are building your milk supply, provide them with positive reinforcement by using a 

## nursing supplementer to provide formula or expressed or donor human milk. You should also stimulate your breasts 

## with breast massage and a good-quality breast pump. 

## Set realistic expectations 

## Don't expect this process to lead to instant results. Your baby may resist nursing for a week to two before they settle 

## back down to breastfeeding, and it may take weeks for your milk supply to increase. To improve your chances of 

## relactating, try to keep your nursing sessions relaxed and pleasurable for both you and your child. Drink enough 

## fluids, and try to maintain an adequate diet. 

## Consider asking for help 

## This is a process that will be much easier with the assistance of a physician with special expertise in breastfeeding 

## management or a lactation consultant. In addition, you might ask for help from family members and friends who may 

## have experienced a similar situation. 

## Supplement if needed 

## Relactation does not always mean a return to exclusive breastfeeding. Since your milk production may well be lower 

## than it was originally, you may need to supplement your baby's nutritional intake with formula, with breast milk from 

## a donor milk (/English/news/Pages/New-AAP-Recommendations-Aim-to-Ensure-Safe-Donor-Human-Milk-Available
