# Infant Allergies and Food Sensitivities 

## Human breast milk typically does not cause allergic reactions in breastfeeding infants, but 

## mothers sometimes worry that their babies may be allergic to something that they themselves 

## are eating and passing into their breast milk. In fact, only two or three out of every one hundred 

## babies who are exclusively breastfed demonstrate an allergic reaction—and that’s most often to 

## the cow’s milk in their mother’s diet. In this case, the infant may show signs of severe colic, 

## abdominal discomfort, or a skin rash such as eczema or hives, or may react with vomiting, severe 

## diarrhea (often with blood in the stool), or difficulty breathing that lasts up to several hours after 

## breastfeeding. 

## If you note any of these symptoms, contact your pediatrician right away. While rare—especially among breastfed 

## babies—milk allergies can be severe or fatal. Most babies eventually outgrow their allergy to cow’s milk, although 

## food allergies to other substances may be lifelong. 

## Breastfeeding exclusively for the first six months of life has been shown to significantly lessen the risk and severity of 

## food allergies (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Food-Allergies-in-Children.aspx) in families with a strong 

## history of them. Exclusive breastfeeding or breastfeeding in combination with partially or extensively hydrolyzed 

## infant formula also reduces the risk for eczema (/English/health-issues/conditions/skin/pages/Eczema.aspx), a 

## condition of excessively dry and easily irritated skin. 

## So far, there is no evidence that avoiding certain foods while breastfeeding can help prevent your child from 

## developing allergies or asthma. The exception to that might be eczema: some studies suggest that avoiding certain 

## foods may reduce your baby’s risk for developing eczema. Still, if your family has experienced severe food allergies, 

## you might consider limiting your intake of milk and dairy products, fish, eggs, peanuts, and other nuts during 

## pregnancy and while breastfeeding. Monitor your baby carefully for skin rashes, breathing problems, unusual stools, 

## or other allergic symptoms, and be sure to tell your pediatrician about your family’s medical history. 

## Food Sensitivities 

## A few mothers notice minor reactions to other foods in their diet. Some babies cry, fuss, or even nurse more often after 

## their mother has eaten spicy or "gassy" foods (such as cabbage). These reactions differ from allergies in that they 

## cause less-serious symptoms (no rashes or abnormal breathing) and almost always last less than twenty-four hours. 

## If your baby reacts negatively every time you eat a certain type of food and you find this troubling, you can just avoid 

## that particular food temporarily. If these symptoms continue on a daily basis and last for long periods, they may 

## indicate colic (/English/ages-stages/baby/crying-colic/pages/Colic.aspx) rather than food sensitivity. Talk with your 

## pediatrician about this possibility, if eliminating various foods has no effect on your child’s symptoms.
