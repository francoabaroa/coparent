# Pacifiers and Thumb Sucking 

## All babies are born with the need to suck. This is 

## important because babies need the sucking reflex to eat 

## and drink. Sucking for some babies also can have a 

## soothing and calming effect. However, when does 

## sucking become a problem? 

## Read on for information from the American Academy 

## of Pediatrics about pacifiers, when pacifier use and 

## thumb and finger sucking could become a problem, 

## and how to help your child stop pacifier use or thumb 

## or finger sucking. 

## What do I need to know before 

## offering a pacifier? 

## If your baby wants to suck beyond what nursing or bottle-feeding provides, a pacifier may satisfy that need. 

## Before offering a pacifier, keep the following tips in mind: 

## Offer a pacifier at nap time and bedtime. This helps to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). If 

## you are breastfeeding, wait until breastfeeding is going well before offering a pacifier. This usually takes about 3 

## to 4 weeks. 

## Do not use a pacifier to replace or delay meals. Only offer it when you are sure your baby is not hungry. 

## Do not force your baby to take the pacifier if he doesn't want it. 

## Never tie a pacifier to your child's crib or around your child's neck or hand. This is very dangerous and could 

## cause serious injury or even death. 

## Be prepared for night waking. If your child depends on a pacifier to fall asleep at night, he may wake up when the 

## pacifier falls out. If your child is too young to put it back in his mouth or can't find or reach it if it has fallen out of 

## the crib, you may need to wake up and get it for him. 

## What should I keep in mind when shopping for a pacifier? 

## Pacifiers come in different sizes. You will also find a variety of nipple shapes, from squarish “orthodontic" 

## versions to the standard bottle type. Try different kinds until you find the one your baby prefers. 

## Look for a 1-piece model that has a soft nipple (some models can break into 2 pieces). 

## The shield should be at least 1½ inches across so a baby cannot put the entire pacifier into her mouth. Also, the 

## shield should be made of firm plastic with airholes. 

## Make sure the pacifier is dishwasher-safe. Follow the instructions on the pacifier and boil it or run it through the 

## dishwasher before your baby uses it. Be sure to squeeze the water out of the nipple with clean hands; otherwise, 

## the hot water inside might burn your baby's mouth. Clean it this way frequently until your baby is 6 months old 

## so that your infant is not exposed to germs. After that you can just wash it with soap and rinse it in clear water. 

## Buy some extras. Pacifiers have a way of getting lost or falling on the floor or street when you need them most. 

## Do not use the nipple from a baby bottle as a pacifier. If the baby sucks hard, the nipple may pop out of the ring 

## and choke her.

### Pacifiers fall apart over time. Some manufacturers have expiration dates for pacifiers. Do not keep pacifiers past 

### that time. Inspect them every once in a while to see whether the rubber has changed color or has torn. If so, 

### replace them. 

## When do pacifier use and thumb and finger sucking become a 

## problem? 

### If your child sucks strongly on a pacifier or his thumb or fingers beyond 2 to 4 years of age, this behavior may affect 

### the shape of his mouth or how his teeth are lining up. If your child stops sucking on a pacifier or his thumb or fingers 

### before his permanent front teeth come in, there's a good chance his bite will correct itself. However, if the bite does 

### not correct itself and the upper adult teeth are sticking out, orthodontic treatment may be needed to realign the teeth 

### and help prevent broken front teeth. 

## How can I help my child stop her pacifier use or thumbor finger

## sucking habit? 

### As a first step in dealing with your child's sucking habits, ignore them! Most often, they will stop on their own. 

### Harsh words, teasing, or punishment may upset your child and is not an effective way to get rid of habits. Instead, 

### try the following: 

### Praise and reward your child when she does not suck her thumb or use the pacifier. Star charts, daily rewards, 

### and gentle reminders, especially during the day, are also very helpful. 

### If your child uses sucking to relieve boredom, keep her hands busy or distract her with things she finds fun. 

### If you see changes in the roof of your child's mouth (palate) or in the way the teeth are lining up, talk with your 

### pediatrician or pediatric dentist. There are devices that can be put in the mouth that make it uncomfortable to 

### suck on a finger or thumb. 

### No matter what method you try, be sure to explain it to your child. If it makes your child afraid or tense, stop it at once. 

### The good news is that most children stop their sucking habits before they get very far in school. This is because of 

### peer pressure. While your child might still use sucking as a way of going to sleep or calming down when upset, this is 

### usually done in private and is not harmful. Putting too much pressure on your child to stop may cause more harm 

### than good. Be assured your child will eventually stop the habit on her own.
