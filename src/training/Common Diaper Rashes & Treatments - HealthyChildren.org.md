# Common Diaper Rashes & Treatments 

## By: Ingrid Polcari MD, FAAP 

## At least half of all babies get a diaper rash at some point. 

## In fact, reddened, inflamed skin in the diaper area is 

## one of the most common reasons parents seek medical 

## care from their child's doctor. You're not alone! 

## Because there are many different types of diaper rashes―and they can look surprisingly similar―check out this list 

## from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) to help identify, soothe, and prevent several different types of 

## diaper rashes. 

## 1. Irritant diaper rash 

## The most common type of diaper rash is "irritant dermatitis." The diaper 

## area spends much of the day in contact with two very irritating substances: 

## urine and stool. If your child has diarrhea (/English/ages-stages/baby/diapers

## clothing/Pages/Diarrhea-in-Babies.aspx) or is teething (/English/ages

## stages/baby/teething-tooth-care/Pages/Babys-First-Tooth-Facts-Parents

## Should-Know.aspx)―meaning extra saliva is being swallowed and passes 

## through the gut―the chance of developing a diaper rash is even greater. 

## Irritant diaper rash looks like pink or red patches on the skin covered by the 

## diaper. The groin folds are more protected from urine and stool, so this skin usually looks normal.

## What parents can do to prevent diaper rash: 

##### In general, try to limit contact of urine and stool with the skin: 

##### Change diapers frequently. Moisture from leaving a wet or soiled diaper on too long can cause skin to chafe. 

##### Urine in the diaper also can break down over time to produce irritating chemicals. In addition, the digestive 

##### enzymes that stool contains can start to wear away at skin. 

##### Clean the skin gently during changes. For wipes, choose a product that is free of alcohol and fragrance. You 

##### can also cleanse the skin with water and a non-soap/gentle cleanser, which may be less painful than wiping if 

##### the skin is irritated or has open sores. Use a squirt or spray bottle of water for severe rashes, if possible, to rinse 

##### without rubbing. Pat gently and allow skin to air-dry. 

##### Coat the skin with a thick layer of barrier paste. The brand is less important than the ingredients. Zinc oxide 

##### and petrolatum are both good choices, and fragrance-free products are best. Think of diaper paste as a shield 

##### that sits between the skin and the contents of the diaper. If the paste isn't soiled, no need to rub it off during 

##### changes; simply add more paste on top. In general, there is no such thing as too much diaper paste. Apply a 

##### thick layer, like icing on a cupcake. 

##### Choose a highly absorbent diaper. The more absorbent the diaper, the better job it does of keeping the skin 

##### dry. Although there is no current evidence showing which type of diaper does the best job of preventing diaper 

##### rash, cloth diapers (/English/ages-stages/baby/diapers-clothing/Pages/Diapers-Disposable-or-Cloth.aspx) 

##### typically are less absorbent than most disposable brands. If you use cloth diapers, you may want to consider 

##### using disposable diapers until the rash heals. 

##### Leave some breathing room. Make sure the diaper isn't too tight, especially overnight. A diaper that is loose 

##### will be less likely to rub against the skin. 

##### Keep the area clean. If the diaper area is irritated, a daily bath (/English/ages-stages/baby/bathing-skin

##### care/Pages/Bathing-Your-Newborn.aspx) will help remove debris, irritants and possible bacteria. Don't forget to 

##### apply a thick layer of barrier paste in the diaper area after bathing. 

## 2. Yeast infection 

##### Another fairly common cause of diaper rash is yeast infection, caused by overgrowth of a type of 

##### fungus found naturally in the digestive tract. Clues that the rash might be due to a yeast infection 

##### include shiny, bright red or pink patches with sharp edges. This rash may also have little pink 

##### bumps or pimples. In severe cases, there may be sores or cracking skin that oozes or bleeds. 

##### Unlike with irritant diaper rash, a yeast diaper rash is usually worse in the groin folds. 

##### A yeast diaper rash may develop after your baby has taken antibiotics. If your baby has this 

##### type of diaper rash, be sure to wash your hands thoroughly before and after diaper changes. Your 

#### pediatrician may recommend or prescribe a topical antifungal cream for the rash. See Thrush and 

#### Other Candida Infections (/English/health-issues/conditions/infections/Pages/Thrush-and-Other-Candida

#### Infections.aspx).

## 3. Bacteria 

##### Rarely, diaper rash can be caused by a bacterial infection. This is also called 

##### impetigo (/English/health-issues/conditions/skin/Pages/Impetigo.aspx). 

##### Certain types of bacteria (like staph (/English/health

##### issues/conditions/infections/Pages/Staphylococcal-Infections.aspx) and strep 

##### (/English/health-issues/conditions/infections/Pages/group-a-streptococcal

##### infections.aspx)) can cause diaper rash or make an existing one worse. Bright 

##### red skin around the anus can be a clue to a strep infection. Yellow crusting, 

##### weeping, or pimples can be a clue to a staphylococcus or "staph" infection. Any 

##### infection in the diaper area needs to be confirmed and treated by your child's doctor.

##### Do not use over-the-counter antibiotic ointment for diaper rashes; sometimes ingredients in these products 

##### can worsen skin irritation.

## 4. Allergy 

##### Occasionally, babies with sensitive skin may have an allergic reaction (/English/health

##### issues/conditions/skin/Pages/Hives.aspx) to a specific ingredient in diapers, wipes, and/or creams. 

##### Common allergens include dyes or elastics in the diaper, and fragrances or preservatives in diaper 

##### wipes or creams. Clues that might suggest an allergy include a rash that happens after every 

##### exposure to that product and a rash that shows up everywhere that product is applied. Switching 

##### brands or types of products for a 2-week period can sometimes help sort this out.

## 5. Other rare types of diaper rashes 

##### There are rare conditions that can start as or mimic diaper rash. Examples include seborrheic dermatitis, which may 

##### involve overproduction of oil in the skin, and pediatric psoriasis (/English/health

##### issues/conditions/skin/Pages/Psoriasis-Not-Eczema-Not-Allergy.aspx). Genetic conditions such as acrodermatitis 

##### enteropathica, an inherited form of zinc deficiency, may also cause rashes in the diaper area. 

## When to call the doctor: 

##### If your child's rash does not clear using the simple tips discussed, contact your child's doctor to see if a prescription 

##### medication is needed. Be sure to follow the instructions carefully; some prescription medications for diaper rash are 

##### only safe to use for short periods of time. 

### Other signs that it is time to call the doctor: 

##### The rash is not going away, or it is getting worse after two to three days of treatment. 

##### The rash includes pimples, peeling skin, blisters, pus-filled or oozing or crusty sores. 

##### Your baby is taking an antibiotic medicine and develops a bright pink or red rash with red spots at the edges. 

##### The rash is especially painful, which could be a sign of cellulitis (/English/health

##### issues/conditions/infections/Pages/Boils-Abscess-and-Cellulitis.aspx). 

##### Your baby has a fever in addition to the rash. 

## Bottom Line: 

##### Talk with your pediatrician if you have any questions about diaper rashes, and how to treat and prevent them.
