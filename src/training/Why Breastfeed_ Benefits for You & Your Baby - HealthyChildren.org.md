# Why Breastfeed: Benefits for You & Your Baby 

## Getting ready for the birth of your baby is an exciting 

## and busy time. One of the most important decisions you 

## will make is how to feed your baby. What matters most 

## is having the information, options and support 

## (/English/news/Pages/pediatricians-say-breastfeeding

## parents-need-more-support.aspx) you need to choose 

## what truly works for you and your family. 

## Breastfeeding: a natural gift 

## Breastfeeding provides a lot of perks for babies and 

## nursing parents. That’s why the American Academy of 

## Pediatrics recommends (/English/ages

## stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Where-We-Stand-Breastfeeding.aspx)exclusive breastfeeding for a newborn’s first 

## six months, and continued breastfeeding as long as parent and baby like after introducing solid foods. But every 

## family’s situation is different. Not everyone can breastfeed or continue breastfeeding for as long they’d like for 

## various reasons. You may choose to breastfeed for a shorter time or combine breastfeeding with baby formula. Others 

## may nurse their little ones for two years or more. 

## It's not an all-or-nothing choice 

## Giving your child at least some breast milk delivers real benefits. And even though exclusive breastfeeding is best in 

## the beginning, this is not an all-or-nothing choice. In general, the longer you breastfeed, the greater the benefits will 

## be to you and your baby, and the longer these benefits will last. 

## Why is breastfeeding so good for my baby? 

## Here are some of the reasons breastfeeding is good for babies: 

## Human milk is a superfood for babies 

## Human milk provides all the nutrients, calories, and fluids needed for your baby health. It supports your baby’s brain 

## development and growth and is easiest for your little one to digest. Breastfeeding continues to deliver the healthy 

## antibodies your infant naturally received in the womb. This boosts your baby’s immunity to everything from the 

## common cold to more serious conditions. In fact, research shows that breastfeeding offers protection from asthma, 

## eczema, diabetes, obesity, leukemia, tooth decay, ear infections, persistent diarrhea and much more. Studies also show 

## that breastfeeding reduces your child’s risks for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) (/English/ages

## stages/baby/sleep/Pages/A-Parents-Guide-to-Safe-Sleep.aspx)as well as other causes of infant death, and even is 

## linked to higher IQ. 

## After giving your baby only breast milk for the first six months, nursing can continue as long as you and your baby 

## wish. Nutritious solid foods (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Starting-Solid-Foods.aspx), those with 

## iron and zinc, should be introduced around six months. The only other thing you will need to give your baby is vitamin 

## D (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Vitamin-Iron-Supplements.aspx)drops, beginning soon after 

## birth. 

## Breastfeeding boosts parent-child bonding 

## Feeding your baby will always provide snuggle time. But the physical, skin-to-skin contact (/English/ages

## stages/baby/preemie/Pages/About-Skin-to-Skin-Care.aspx) of nursing helps create a special bond between you and 

## your baby. Your baby will be comforted by the scent of your skin, the sound of your heartbeat and even the flavor of 

## your milk. Breast milk has a naturally sweet taste, but also changes flavors depending on what you eat. No two meals 

## are the same for your baby. This can have the added bonus of making them more likely to enjoy new foods 

## (/English/tips-tools/ask-the-pediatrician/Pages/How-Do-I-Help-My-Picky-Eater-Try-More-Foods.aspx)you offer once 

## they start eating solids.

## Why is breastfeeding good for me? 

#### Here are some of the ways breastfeeding benefits parents: 

### Breastfeeding benefits the nursing parent's health 

#### If you’re the parent producing milk, your own health will benefit. It can help you recover from childbirth more quickly 

#### and easily. Hormones released during breastfeeding help the uterus to its regular size more quickly and can reduce 

#### postpartum bleeding. 

#### Likely because of hormonal changes, breastfeeding protects you against diabetes, high blood pressure and cancers of 

#### the breast and ovaries. It may also help keep bones strong, which helps protect against bone fractures in older age. It 

#### also triggers the release of oxytocin, a hormone that has been linked with feelings of empathy, affection, calmness and 

#### positive communication—all of which can help you be the warm, attentive parent you want to be. 

### Breastfeeding can save money & prep time 

#### Unlike formula, breast milk requires no purchase or preparation. Breastfeeding is also good for the environment, 

#### since there are no bottles to wash or formula cans to throw away. It’s wonderful, too, to be able to pick up the baby and 

#### go out—whether around town or on longer trips—without having to pack and carry a bag full of feeding equipment. 

#### And while you may want to invest in a breast pump to make feeding more convenient, the cost of buying or renting a 

#### pump will likely be less than a year’s supply of formula. Plus, it is often reimbursed by insurance plans. 

### Breastfeeding supports contraception 

#### Breastfeeding parents often find that their period does not return, especially during the first six months after birth. 

#### This can help keep iron in your body and may offer some natural contraceptive benefits. If you are giving your child 

#### only breast milk during this time, the baby is not yet six months, AND your period has not returned chances are good 

#### that you will not ovulate. (No ovulation, no pregnancy!) In fact, if you meet all three of these conditions, the level of 

#### contraceptive protection approaches 98%. 

## Overcoming challenges to breastfeeding 

### Finding expert support 

#### For many nursing parents and babies, breastfeeding goes smoothly from the start. For others, it takes a little time and 

#### several attempts to get the process going effectively. Sore nipples, milk supply issues, not to mention the need to sit 

#### still for hours every day are very real issues. Talking with a midwife, lactation consultant, or doctor trained in 

#### breastfeeding right after birth can help. They can show you helpful techniques and breastfeeding positions that can 

#### help relieve nipple pain. Your pediatrician or OB-GYN can check your breasts during your postpartum visit and 

#### suggest ways to ease any discomfort you’re feeling. 

### Community & workplace support 

#### There’s also the time and space it can take to breastfeed or pump your milk. It can be challenging to step away to do 

#### this, and there are some jobs that can make near impossible. This is one reason why support from partners, families, 

#### employers and communities is key. More and more employers are adopting breastfeeding-friendly policies, and laws 

#### in all 50 states protect parents’ right to breastfeed in public. By seeking the support that you need, including hands-on 

#### help at home and work, chances are good you may find the time and space to breastfeed successfully.
