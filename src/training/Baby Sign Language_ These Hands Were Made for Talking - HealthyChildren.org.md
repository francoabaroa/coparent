# Baby Sign Language: These Hands Were Made for Talking 

## By Laura Jana, MD, FAAP & Jennifer Shu, MD, FAAP 

## While you may not have come across it just yet, baby 

## sign language is a trend that seems to have real staying 

## power. Signing with babies is based on the simple 

## observation that children can be taught to use their 

## hands to "talk" long before their mouths can catch up. 

## Using simple sign language with 

## your baby 

## Here are a few reasons why using simple sign language 

## with your child is worth considering: 

## Breaking the language barrier. From what we’ve seen in our own children and others (including in Laura’s 

## educational child care center), infant sign language really does deliver on its promise of improved 

## communication. This is a particularly appealing promise for new parents, given that there’s a well-recognized 

## gap between what babies and toddlers want to say and what they are capable of saying. 

## It only makes sense that young children who lack the verbal skills necessary to say what they want, feel, or need 

## experience frustration—especially in the period between 8 or 9 months (when babies start to really know what it 

## is they want) and 18 to 24 months (when they typically start to speak their mind). In other words, if basic sign 

## language can help babies use their hands to better express themselves at as early as 8 or 9 months, it can mean 

## the bridging of this otherwise months long communication gap. 

## Bonding fun. Signing with babies can also offer an opportunity for plenty of positive interaction, and anything 

## that increases parent baby bonding is a good thing in our book. One creative idea we love: Start learning and 

## adding signs to your musical repertoire of popular baby songs such as "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star" and "Old 

## MacDonald Had a Farm." 

## Long story short, if you approach signing with your baby as an interactive and rewarding activity, then it’s 

## guaranteed to be all for fun and fun for all. In fact, if it’s not fun, then you shouldn’t be doing it. 

## Signs of the times: words with babies 

## There’s nothing wrong with teaching young children to "recite" the ABCs of sign language, but the most useful signs— 

## especially for infants and toddlers—are going to be those that convey more than just the letters of the alphabet. Signs 

## you’ll want to start with are those that are the most meaningful or serve to describe the things your baby most often 

## sees, does, or wants. 

## Here is a list of favorites we’ve put together in order to give you a better feel for some common signs of the early 

## childhood. Start by learning these and you’re sure to get the conversation started: airplane, baby, ball, bird, blanket, 

## book, cat, cup, cold, daddy, diaper, dog, done, drink, eat, go, good night, happy, help, hot, hurt, I love you, milk, mommy, 

## more, nap, no, outside, please, sit, sleep, star, thank you, up, water. 

## Tips for getting started 

## While signing isn’t exactly a must for new parents, it isn’t exactly difficult to learn, either. Books, videos, websites and 

## apps that handily address the basics of baby signing abound. It’s easy to see why so many parents swear by it, why 

## child care centers include it in their infant and toddler classrooms, and why it has become so commonplace as an 

## activity of daily learning. Here are some big-picture tips to get you started.

#### Be patient. The baby-signing trend is based on the observation that babies taught simple signs at 6 or 7 months 

#### of age could begin using them to communicate at as early as 8 or 9 months. While there’s no reason you have to 

#### wait until your baby turns 6 months to get started, we encourage you to be realistic in your expectations for any 

#### true signs of success. 

#### Speak up. Be sure you don’t cut back on the amount of time you spend talking with your baby. As long as signing 

#### does not take the place of speaking, it won’t get in the way of your baby’s learning to talk with her words as well as 

#### her hands. 

#### Make it a habit. As with much of the learning your baby will be doing, repetition is key. For a better shot at 

#### success, make signing a daily habit, not a one-time lesson. Use the same signs consistently. Tapping your fingers 

#### to your lips could convey "eat," for example. Touching the left and right fingertips together can mean "more." 

#### Sign what you see. Use signs to describe routine activities and common objects that make up your baby’s world. 

#### Don’t be heavy handed. Don’t worry if your baby doesn’t get the signs quite right or doesn’t pick them up right 

#### away. Remember the goal here is to have fun communicating and lessen frustration, not add to it. 

#### Share your signs. Be sure you share your signs with your baby’s other caregivers so that everyone can join in on 

#### and understand the conversation once your baby begins to sign. And if your baby’s child care provider is going to 

#### be the one teaching your baby sign language, be sure to ask for a quick tutorial so you will understand what your 

#### baby wants when she starts signing to you.
