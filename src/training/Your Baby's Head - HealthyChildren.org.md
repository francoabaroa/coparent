# Your Baby's Head 

## By Laura Jana, MD, FAAP & Jennifer Shu, MD, FAAP 

## Many parents have been mistakenly led to believe that 

## all newborns are born picture-perfect, with pretty little 

## round heads. Let us just say that for anyone who has 

## gone through or will experience vaginal delivery, it is 

## nothing short of a blessing that a baby’s skull is made 

## up of soft bony plates that are capable of compressing 

## and overlapping to fit through the narrow birth canal— 

## a process referred to as molding. 

## Shaping up 

## For some babies—such as those who "drop" well in advance of being born (in other words, settle themselves head first 

## deep into their mother’s pelvis well in advance of delivery), or those who must endure long labors and narrow birth 

## canals—the result is often a newborn head shape that more closely resembles a cone than a nice round ball. 

## If you run your fingers over your newborn’s skull, you may also find that you can feel ridges along the areas where the 

## bony plates of the skull have overlapped. In short, slightly misshapen heads (/English/health-issues/conditions/Cleft

## Craniofacial/Pages/Uneven-Head-Shape-Craniosynostosis.aspx) are quite common right after birth. 

## Fortunately, over the next several weeks the bones of your baby’s skull will almost assuredly round out and the ridges 

## will disappear—assuming, that is, that your baby doesn’t spend too much time on their back with his head in any one 

## position. This is a common but easily avoidable cause for the development of a flat back or side of the head known as 

## plagiocephaly (/English/health-issues/conditions/Cleft-Craniofacial/Pages/Positional-Skull-Deformities-and

## Torticollis.aspx). 

## The soft spot 

## You will notice one to two areas on your baby’s head that seem to be lacking bony protection. These soft spots, 

## referred to as fontanelles (anterior for the larger one in the front, posterior for the smaller and typically less 

## noticeable one in the back), are normal gaps in a newborn’s skull that will allow your baby’s brain to grow rapidly 

## throughout the next year. 

## Many parents are afraid to touch these soft spots, but you can rest assured that, despite their lack of a bony layer, they 

## are well protected from typical day-to-day baby handling. Other things to know about the soft spot(s) include: 

## In young infants, a sunken soft spot (when combined with poor feeding and dry diapers) can suggest dehydration 

## (/English/health-issues/injuries-emergencies/Pages/dehydration.aspx). Our advice to you: Don’t read too much 

## into this because it can be a subtle finding or sometimes be present in normal babies. Instead, make sure you 

## have a good grasp on how to recognize dehydration and check with your doctor if you have any concerns—with 

## or without a sunken soft spot. 

## In some instances, the soft spot on the top of your baby’s head may seem to be pulsating. There is no need to 

## worry—this movement is quite normal and simply reflects the visible pulsing of blood that corresponds to your 

## baby’s heartbeat. 

## Bumps & bruises 

## In addition to molding, a bit of swelling or bruising of the scalp immediately following delivery is not uncommon for 

## newborns. The swelling usually is most noticeable at the top back part of the head and is medically referred to as a 

## caput (short for caput succedaneum). When bruising of the head occurs during delivery, the result can be a boggy

## feeling area, called a cephalohematoma (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/How-Your-Newborn-Looks.aspx).

#### Bruising and swelling are usually harmless and go away on their own over the first days and weeks, but can be a 

#### contributing factor for jaundice (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Common-Conditions-in-Newborns.aspx). 

## Gone today, but hair tomorrow 

#### Sure, babies are sometimes born with full heads of hair, but it’s far more likely for them to be born with little to none. 

#### And those with hair today are likely to find it gone tomorrow. That’s because any hair your baby is born with is likely 

#### to thin out significantly over the next few months before ultimately being replaced with "real" hair. It is also entirely 

#### possible that whatever hair your newborn does have will change color by several shades and several times over their 

#### lifetime.
