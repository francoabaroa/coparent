# Stages of Newborn Sleep 

## Sleep patterns in newborns are different from those in older children and adults. 

## For newborns, sleep is about equally divided between 

## rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep and 

## follows these stages: 

## Stage 1: Drowsiness, in which the baby starts to fall asleep. 

## Stage 2: REM sleep (also referred to as active sleep ), in which the baby may twitch or jerk her arms or legs, and her eyes move 

## under her closed eyelids. Breathing is often irregular and may stop for 5 to 10 seconds—a condition called normal periodic 

## breathing of infancy —then start again with a burst of rapid breathing at the rate of 50 to 60 breaths a minute for 10 to 15 seconds, 

## followed by regular breathing until the cycle repeats itself. The baby’s skin color does not change with the pauses in breathing 

## and there is no cause for concern (in contrast with apnea (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/Sleep-Apnea

## Detection.aspx)). Babies generally outgrow periodic breathing by about the middle of the first year. 

## Stage 3: Light sleep, in which breathing becomes more regular and sleep becomes less active. 

## Stages 4 and 5: Deep non-REM sleep (also referred to as quiet sleep ). Twitching and other movements cease, and the baby falls 

## into sleep that becomes progressively deeper. During these stages, the baby may be more difficult to awake.
