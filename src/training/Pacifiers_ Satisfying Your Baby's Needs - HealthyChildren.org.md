# Pacifiers: Satisfying Your Baby's Needs 

## All babies are born with the need to suck. This is important because babies need the sucking 

## reflex to eat and drink. Sucking for some babies also can have a soothing and calming effect. 

## What do I need to know before offering a pacifier? 

## If your baby wants to suck beyond what nursing (/english/ages

## stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/default.aspx) or bottle-feeding (/English/ages

## stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Bottle-Feeding-How-It%27s-Done.aspx) provides, a pacifier 

## may satisfy that need. Before offering a pacifier, keep the following tips in mind: 

## Offer a pacifier at nap time and bedtime. This helps to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) 

## (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/Preventing-SIDS.aspx). If you are breastfeeding, wait until breastfeeding 

## is going well before offering a pacifier. This usually takes about 3 to 4 weeks. 

## Do not use a pacifier to replace or delay meals. Only offer it when you are sure your baby is not hungry. 

## Do not force your baby to take the pacifier if he doesn't want it. 

## Never tie a pacifier to your child's crib (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/New-Crib-Standards-What

## Parents-Need-to-Know.aspx) or around your child's neck or hand. This is very dangerous and could cause serious 

## injury or even death. 

## Be prepared for night waking. If your child depends on a pacifier to fall asleep at night, he may wake up when the 

## pacifier falls out. If you child is too young to put it back in his mouth or can't find or reach it if it has fallen out of 

## the crib, you may need to wake up and get it for him. 

## What should I keep in mind when shopping for a pacifier? 

## Pacifiers come in different sizes. You will also find a variety of nipple shapes, from squarish "orthodontic" 

## versions to the standard bottle type. Try different kinds until you find the one your baby prefers. 

## Look for a 1-piece model that has a soft nipple (some models can break into 2 pieces). 

## The shield should be at least 11/2 inches across so a baby cannot put the entire paci¬fier into her mouth. Also, the 

## shield should be made of firm plastic with airholes. 

## Make sure the pacifier is dishwasher-safe. Follow the instructions on the pacifier and boil it or run it through the 

## dishwasher before your baby uses it. Be sure to squeeze the water out of the nipple with clean hands; otherwise, 

## the hot water inside might burn your baby's mouth. Clean it this way frequently until your baby is 6 months old 

## so that your infant is not exposed to germs. After that you can just wash it with soap and rinse it in clear water. 

## Buy some extras. Pacifiers have a way of getting lost or falling on the floor or street when you need them most. 

## Do not use the nipple from a baby bottle as a pacifier. If the baby sucks hard, the nipple may pop out of the ring 

## and choke her. 

## Pacifiers fall apart over time. Some manufacturers have expiration dates for pacifiers. Do not keep pacifiers past 

## that time. Inspect them every once in a while to see whether the rubber has changed color or has torn. If so, 

## replace them.
