# How Can I Tell If My Baby is Constipated? 

## New parents often worry that their babies are not 

## pooping (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Pooping-By

## the-Numbers.aspx) enough. A baby eating formula 

## usually has a bowel movement at least once most days, 

## but may go 1 to 2 days between bowel movements. For 

## breastfed infants (/English/ages

## stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/How-to-Tell-if-Baby

## is-Getting-Enough-Milk.aspx)it depends on age. During 

## the first month of life, stooling less than once a day 

## might mean your newborn isn’t eating enough. 

## However, breastfed infants may go several days or even 

## a week between bowel movements, using every drop 

## they eat to make more baby, not poop. 

## Infants normally work really hard to have a bowel movement, so straining at the stool isn’t necessarily alarming, even 

## when the infant cries or gets red in the face. For an infant to have a bowel movement can be a major effort, and it 

## shows. Just imagine trying to poop lying on your back and you’ll get the picture. 

## If you're concerned your baby may be constipated, ask yourself the 

## following questions: 

## Is my baby excessively fussy? 

## Is my baby spitting up (/English/tips-tools/Symptom-Checker/Pages/Spitting-Up-Reflux.aspx)more than usual? 

## Is my baby having dramatically more or fewer bowel movements than before? 

## Are my baby's stools unusually hard, or do they contain blood related to hard stools? 

## Does my baby strain for more than 10 minutes without success? 

## These signs can all suggest actual constipation. 

## Is there anything I can give my baby for constipation? 

## Once your baby is at least a month old, if you think they are constipated, you can try giving them a little apple or pear 

## juice. The sugars in these fruit juices aren’t digested very well, so they draw fluid into the intestines and help loosen 

## stool. Although fruit juice is not recommended (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Fruit-Juice-and-Your-Childs

## Diet.aspx) for babies under a year of age, as a rule of thumb, you can give 1 ounce a day for every month of life up to 

## about 4 months (a 3-month-old baby would get 3 ounces). Once your infant is taking solid foods (/English/ages

## stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Starting-Solid-Foods.aspx)you can try vegetables and fruits, especially that old 

## standby, prunes. If these dietary changes don’t help, it’s time to call your child's pediatrician.
