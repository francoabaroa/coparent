## Everyone feels stressed or down sometimes, including kids. Play (/English/family-life/power-of

## play/Pages/default.aspx) is a great way to help them feel better. Beyond providing a fun distraction, play can help 

## children get in touch with their feelings. Play is a powerful way to get inside your child's mind a bit and give them a 

## sense of control and mastery over life. In fact, play therapy is one of the treatment (/English/health

## by behavioral health experts when they work with children. 

## Read on for a few ways play can help you boost your child's mood at home. 

## 1. Let kids lead the way in play 

## One of the things parents tend to do when their kids get grumpy or defiant is to micro-manage more. But 

## part of a young child's normal emotional development (/English/ages-stages/toddler/Pages/Emotional

## Development-2-Year-Olds.aspx), especially by about age 2, is struggling to gain more control their actions, 

## impulses, feelings and their body. This can become frustrating for them at times. 

## Play, on the other hand, lets your child feel more in control. You can just sit back and observe. Turn off 

## digital distractions, bring out whatever your child is in the mood to play with (crayons, blocks, action 

## figures, whatever!) and don't direct the play. It's ok to ask questions, or say things like, "Oh that's cool!" or 

## "What can I draw?" but try to notice when you want to jump in and control things, and resist that urge. 


## 2. Focus on bringing out the smiles 

### One of the best things about play is the natural joy that can come from being silly together, popping 

### bubbles, chasing and tickling or telling jokes. You don’t need to demand that your child join you—you 

### can start without them and let them choose to join in (this way, they feel in more control). Studies show 

### that playing in "synchrony" with your kids—such as taking turns blowing bubbles, dancing to the same 

### songs or doing funny faces in the mirror—is great for their emotional development. 

## 3. Make identifying emotions a game

### One activity to try is drawing a grid with 4 zones and a circle in each of them. Then, turn the circles into 

### faces with different emotions. Let your child help you draw the faces, identify the feelings and list a few 

### things that make them feel that way. You can also talk about what they can do to feel better when 

### something makes them feel bad, so they can get back to the happy zone. You can ask questions about how 

### their favorite book (/English/healthy-living/emotional-wellness/Building-Resilience/Pages/Books-to

### Build-Character-Teach-Important-Values.aspx) or cartoon characters might be feeling. Emotions don’t 

### need to be scary—like Mister Rogers said, we need to teach kids that they are mentionable and 

### manageable. 

## 4. Keep the fun moving

### Physical activity (/English/healthy-living/fitness/StopWatch-Tool/Pages/default.aspx) can have a 

### powerful effect on mood. Occupational therapists know that stretching the joints, bouncing around, 

### swinging, or other sensory/motor activities can really help kids feel alert and more positive. Look around 

### your yard or neighborhood to see what could make into a daily body-moving routine. Visiting a 

### playground, riding bikes, playing tag or simple activities like jumping rope kicking a ball around are all 

### good options.
