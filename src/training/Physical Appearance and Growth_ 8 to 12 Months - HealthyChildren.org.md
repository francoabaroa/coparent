# Physical Appearance and Growth: 8 to 12 Months 

## Your baby will continue to grow rapidly during these months. The typical eight-month-old boy 

## weighs between 17.5 and 22 pounds (8 to 10 kg). Girls tend to weigh half a pound less. By his first 

## birthday, the average child has tripled his birth weight and is 28 to 32 inches (71 to 81 cm) tall. 

## Head growth between eight and twelve months slows down a bit from the first six months. 

## Typical head size at eight months is 17 1⁄2 inches (44.5 cm) in circumference; by one year, it’s 18 

## inches (46 cm). Each baby grows at his own rate, however, so you should check your child’s height 

## and weight curves on the growth charts in the Appendix to make sure he’s following the pattern 

## established in his first eight months. 

## When your child first stands, you may be surprised by his posture. His belly will protrude, his rear end will stick out, 

## and his back will have a forward sway to it. It may look unusual, but this stance is perfectly normal from the time he 

## starts to stand until he develops a confident sense of balance sometime in the second year. 

## Your child’s feet also may look a little odd to you. When he lies on his back, his toes may turn inward so that he 

## appears pigeon-toed. This common condition usually disappears by eighteen months. If it persists, your pediatrician 

## may show you some foot or leg exercises to do with your baby. If the problem is severe, your pediatrician may refer 

## you to a pediatric orthopedist. 

## When your child takes his first teetering steps, you may notice quite a different appearance—his feet may turn 

## outward. This occurs because the ligaments of his hips are still so loose that his legs naturally rotate outward. During 

## the first six months of his second year, the ligaments will tighten and then his feet should point nearly straight. 

## At this age, your child’s feet will seem flat because the arch is hidden by a pad of fat. In two to three years, this fat will 

## disappear and his arch will be evident.
