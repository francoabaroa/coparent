# Special Health Needs: Non-Medical Necessities Matter, 

# Too 

## By: Joan Jeung, MD, MPH, FAAP 

## If your child has special healthcare needs, you're 

## probably used to asking doctors questions about 

## medications and treatments to help your child. But did 

## you know that your doctor can help support your entire 

## family's well-being? 

## This support can include non-medical concerns like 

## meeting basic needs (such as food and housing) and 

## dealing with stress and emotional concerns. 

## Pediatricians know that addressing these issues can 

## make a big difference in your child's health, 

## development, and overall well-being. 

## Supporting your entire family's well-being 

## Our living conditions, daily life, relationships, and emotions shape our health as much as medicine and technology do. 

## That's why we call these things "social determinants of health." 

## More than 1 in 5 children in the United States live in families that struggle to make ends meet. If your family is in a 

## similar situation, you are not alone. More and more, pediatricians are recognizing that we need to partner with 

## families to meet basic needs like nutritious food and safe housing if we want all children to be healthy and thrive. 

## Medical issues and everyday life 

## For children and youth with special healthcare needs, medical issues and the stress of daily life can impact each other 

## in unique ways. Taking time off work for a child's medical appointments, or paying for transportation to all those 

## appointments, may become difficult. Sometimes it's too hard for parents to juggle a paid job with the many demands 

## of caring for a child with special needs. And sometimes insurance or financial issues make it hard to afford care. 

## The time and effort needed to handle a child's medical care may leave little space for bringing up such practical, day

## to-day needs during a medical visit. Families may not know whether it's OK to talk about such challenges with their 

## doctors. But your doctor is here to help with any challenges your family is facing, even if it isn't doesn't seem directly 

## related to your child's medical care. 

## Emotions and mental health also matter 

## More than 40% of children with special healthcare needs have an emotional, developmental, or behavioral issue. 

## These challenges can affect their ability to care for themselves and their families' ability to care for them. 

## For many children, their special need is a developmental delay, learning difference (/English/health

## issues/conditions/learning-disabilities/Pages/Learning-Disabilities-What-Parents-Need-To-Know.aspx), or behavioral 

## condition like attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (/English/health

## issues/conditions/adhd/Pages/Understanding-ADHD.aspx) (ADHD) or autism (/English/health

## issues/conditions/Autism/Pages/Autism-Spectrum-Disorder.aspx). These needs may not be as visible to others but 

## are still life-changing. 

## Other family members may also experience a lot of stress. The family needs to be healthy to keep caring for a child; 

## it's hard for a child to be healthy if the family is not.

## Help is available 

### Support services are available, and it is important for all families of children with special healthcare needs to know 

### where and how to access them. Examples include: 

### Medicaid and the Supplemental Children's Insurance Program (SCHIP) provides free or affordable 

### insurance for many children and youth. Each state receives additional federal funding (through Title V 

### (https://mchb.hrsa.gov/maternal-child-health-initiatives/title-v-maternal-and-child-health-services-block

### grant-program)) to help pay for healthcare for additional supports and services based on a medical condition. 

### Family-to-Family (F2F) Health Information Centers. It can also be helpful to talk with other parents and 

### caregivers with experience in getting help for children with similar needs as yours. Look for a Family-to-Family 

### (F2F) Health Information Center near you. These family-led centers are funded by the Health Resources and 

### Services Administration (https://mchb.hrsa.gov/) (HRSA). 

### Family Voices. Another helpful resource is Family Voices (https://familyvoices.org/), a national family-led 

### organization providing support to families with children and youth with special healthcare needs and disabilities. 

## Your pediatrician's office can help connect you with resources 

### You might have seen your child's pediatrician give out surveys asking about basic needs and emotional well-being; 

### however, even if this might not be your experience, the door is open to talk with your doctor about these concerns. 

### Many clinics have social workers or other staff members who are knowledgeable about community resources. They 

### can help link your child and family to the help you need, whether that's transportation, school services, extra income, 

### the local food bank, or parenting support and mental health services. A growing number of clinics also have 

### counselors on staff, who can help with emotional and behavioral concerns. 

## Your medical home 

### This is what we call the medical home (/English/family-life/health-management/pages/default.aspx): a team of 

### professionals who know your child and family, identifies your child's healthcare conditions, and works with your 

### family to come up with a plan and coordinate the care that your child and family needs. For clinics or practices that do 

### not have these services available to families onsite, your doctor may be able to refer you to these services in your 

### community. 

### In other words, you don't have to figure it all out on your own. Your child's doctor and medical home team are here to 

### partner with you in helping your family and child. Pediatricians and the medical home team are here to help the 

### whole child and family. 

## Remember 

### Don't hesitate to talk with your child's doctor about practical, social, and emotional concerns you may have, too. All of 

### these affect your child's health.
