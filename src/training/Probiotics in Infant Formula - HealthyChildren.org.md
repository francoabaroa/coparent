# Probiotics in Infant Formula 

## "Probiotics" (meaning "for life") is a word you may see 

## when shopping for infant formula (/English/ages

## stages/baby/formula-feeding/Pages/choosing-an

## infant-formula.aspx) and supplements. Some formulas 

## are fortified with these probiotics, which are types of 

## live bacteria. Doctors may also recommend probiotic 

## drops or powders for breastfed infants. These are "good" 

## or "friendly" bacteria already present at high levels in 

## the digestive system of breastfed babies. 

## In formula-fed babies, probiotics in formulas promote a 

## balance of bacteria in your baby's intestines, and offset 

## the growth of "unfriendly" organisms that could cause 

## infections and inflammation. 

## Increasingly, parents can find probiotic supplements outside of formula, including for breastfed infants. Research on 

## the benefits of probiotics is ongoing, with some pediatricians embracing their use for infants delivered by C-section or 

## those whose mothers are given antibiotics during labor. 

## Possible health benefits of probiotics 

## The most common types of probiotics are strains of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. Some research has shown these 

## probiotics may prevent or treat disorders such as infectious diarrhea (/English/tips-tools/symptom

## checker/Pages/symptomviewer.aspx?symptom=Diarrhea) and atopic dermatitis (eczema) in children. Other possible 

## health benefits are being studied as well, including the possibility of reduced risk of food-related allergies and asthma, 

## prevention of urinary tract infections, and relief of symptoms of infant colic (/English/tips-tools/symptom

## checker/Pages/symptomviewer.aspx?symptom=Crying+Baby+-+Before+3+Months+Old). 

## More research is needed 

## With many of these health conditions, the evidence confirming any positive effects of probiotic use is limited and 

## more research is needed. At this time, benefits appear to occur only as long as probiotics are being taken. Once your 

## baby stops consuming probiotic-fortified formula, intestinal bacteria levels return to previous levels. This is different 

## from in breastfed infants, where the bacteria in the gut resulting from breastfeeding (/English/ages

## stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Breastfeeding-Benefits-Your-Babys-Immune-System.aspx) are more resilient and 

## set the stage for healthier outcomes. 

## Remember 

## Before giving your child infant formula fortified with probiotics, discuss the issue with your pediatrician
