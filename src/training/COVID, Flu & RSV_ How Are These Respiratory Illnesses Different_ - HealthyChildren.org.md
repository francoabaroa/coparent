# COVID, Flu & RSV: How Are These Respiratory Illnesses 

# Different? 

## Your child has a stuffy nose, cough and fever. Is it a 

## cold? The flu? Or are they symptoms of COVID? Some 

## COVID, flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and cold 

## symptoms can be alike. But there are some clues that 

## set each of these common viruses apart. 

## Is it COVID, the flu, RSV or a common cold? 

## Let's look at the viruses that cause four common childhood illnesses—COVID (/English/health

## issues/conditions/COVID-19/Pages/2019-Novel-Coronavirus.aspx), flu (/English/health-issues/conditions/chest

## lungs/Pages/The-Flu.aspx), the common cold (/English/health-issues/conditions/ear-nose-throat/Pages/Children

## and-Colds.aspx) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (/English/health-issues/conditions/chest-lungs/Pages/RSV

## When-Its-More-Than-Just-a-Cold.aspx). All of them share some similar symptoms. This can make it hard to tell them 

## apart. Here are some clues that help your pediatrician figure out what kind of respiratory illness is making your child 

## sick. 

## COVID symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, congestion, shortness of breath, sore throat, headache, sneezing, 

## vomiting/diarrhea, or loss of taste/smell. COVID symptoms can appear 2 to 14 days 

## (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) after infection. 

## Flu symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, stuffy nose, shortness of breath, sore throat, headache. Symptoms 

## show up about 1 to 4 days after being exposed to a sick person. The infection can cause pneumonia 

## (/English/health-issues/conditions/chest-lungs/Pages/Pneumonia.aspx). 

## RSV can cause a fever, cough, fatigue, stuffy nose, shortness of breath, sneezing, fast/short breaths, flaring 

## nostrils, wheezing and grunting, poor feeding/no appetite, and head bobbing or chest caving in between and 

## under ribs with each breath. Symptoms of RSV usually are worst on days 3 through 5 and last about 5 to 7 days. 

## The infection causes a cold, which may be followed by bronchiolitis (/English/health-issues/conditions/chest

## lungs/Pages/bronchiolitis.aspx) or pneumonia (/English/health-issues/conditions/chest

## lungs/Pages/Pneumonia.aspx). RSV is common in late fall through early spring. In 2021, however, the pandemic 

## caused a strange thing to happen. The number of RSV infections and hospital rates went up in summer 2021 

## instead. Nearly all children get RSV by their second birthday. 

## Common cold symptoms may include fever, cough, fatigue, stuffy nose, sore throat, sneezing. Colds are upper 

## respiratory infections that can be caused by many viruses. A few common cold viruses are rhinovirus, 

## adenovirus, human coronavirus, human parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus and RSV. Healthy 

## children get about 6 colds a year. 

## An early wave of seasonal infections in kids this fall is 

## being called a "tripledemic." The spike in RSV, COVID, 

## flu and other infections in children has contributed to 

## overcrowded emergency departments and more kids 

## needing hospital stays 

## (https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2022/pediatric-health-care-organizations-call

## for-national-response-on-rsv-and-flu-surge/) than usual time of year. 


## Can kids get more than one illness at the same time? 

#### Yes. Your doctor may refer to this as a secondary illness. For example, it is not unusual for children with flu or COVID 

#### to develop moderate or severe pneumonia. And cold symptoms (/English/tips-tools/symptom

#### checker/Pages/symptomviewer.aspx?symptom=Colds) can lead to another health problem like an ear infection or

#### sinus infection. 

#### Because some of the symptoms of flu, COVID and other respiratory illnesses are similar, the Centers for Disease 

#### Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends testing 

#### (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/testing.htm#anchor_1596736120603) to confirm a diagnosis. People can be 

#### infected with both flu and COVID at the same time and have symptoms of both.

## How to avoid getting sick now that viruses are so unpredictable 

#### Vaccines are an effective tool to prevent serious illness from the flu, COVID and other vaccine-preventable diseases. 

#### Staying up to date on routine immunizations also helps others. The protection from vaccines can help to keep people 

#### at risk of serious problems from flu

#### Control-of), COVID (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm705152a3.htm) (and its complications, like MIS-C 

#### (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7102e1.htm)), and other viruses out of the hospital (/English/health

#### issues/injuries-emergencies/Pages/What-to-Expect-If-Your-Child-is-Admitted-to-the-Hospital.aspx). 

#### Everyone 6 months and older should get flu vaccines each year. Get your child vaccinated by the end of October to 

#### protect them throughout flu season, which can last until the end of May. Everyone 6 months and older 

#### (/English/health-issues/conditions/COVID-19/Pages/covid-vaccines-for-kids-6-months-and-older-faqs-for

#### families.aspx) also should receive COVID vaccinations. 

#### There is no vaccine for RSV or the common cold. For RSV, some infants who are at risk of serious problems can 

#### receive an injectable medicine called palivizumab. It protects babies who were born significantly premature, had a 

#### heart defect or weak immune system. 

#### There are many tools other to help stop viruses from spreading. Children should learn to cover their mouths and 

#### noses with a tissue when they cough or sneeze (and then put the tissue in the trash right away). Wearing a mask in 

#### public (/English/health-issues/conditions/COVID-19/Pages/Cloth-Face-Coverings-for-Children-During-COVID

#### 19.aspx) can help prevent COVID, flu and other viruses from spreading. And everyone should be encouraged to wash 

#### their hands with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. 

## Remember 

#### If your child is sick and you have any questions or concerns about their symptoms, don't hesitate to call your 

#### pediatrician. And, it is important for all children to stay up to date on immunizations, sports physical examinations and 

#### routine care (/English/family-life/health-management/Pages/Well-Child-Care-A-Check-Up-for-Success.aspx).
