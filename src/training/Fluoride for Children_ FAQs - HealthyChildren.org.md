## Here are some common questions parents ask about 

## how fluoride helps protect children's oral health. 

## Q: Why do children need fluoride? 

## A: Fluoride is a natural mineral that can slow or stop cavities from forming. Bacteria in the mouth combine with 

## sugars and make acid that can harm the outer layer of the tooth (enamel). Fluoride protects teeth from damage and 

## helps rebuild the enamel. Many communities have added fluoride to the tap water to help fight cavities. Children 

## should drink plenty of water and brush with toothpaste that has fluoride in it. 

## Drinking tap water protects kids' teeth!Drinking tap water protects kids' teeth! 

## Q: Is fluoridated water safe for my children? 

## A: Yes. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Dental Association, and the Centers for Disease 

## Control and Prevention agree that water fluoridation (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/healthy-living/oral

## health/Pages/Water-Fluoridation.aspx) is safe and works to prevent tooth decay 

## (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/healthy-living/oral-health/pages/Preventing-Tooth-Decay-in

## Children.aspx). Community water fluoridation has been shown to reduce tooth decay by 25%. 

## Q: When should my child start using fluoride toothpaste? 

## A : The AAP recommends using a "smear" of fluoride toothpaste twice a day when the first tooth appears and until age 

## 3. Once your child has turned 3, a pea-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste can be used.

## Q: What if we live in a community where the water is not fluoridated? 

## What can we do? 

### A: Check with your local water utility agency to find out (https://nccd.cdc.gov/doh_mwf/Default/Default.aspx) if your 

### water has fluoride in it. If it doesn't or you have well water, ask your pediatrician or dentist if your child is at high risk 

### for cavities. The doctor may recommend you buy fluoridated water or give you a prescription for fluoride drops or 

### tablets for your child. 

## Q: Should my child get fluoride varnish? 

### A : Yes. Fluoride varnish (/English/healthy-living/oral-health/Pages/Fluoride-Varnish-What-Parents-Need-to

### Know.aspx) is used to help prevent or slow down tooth decay. Your pediatrician will apply the varnish starting when 

### your baby is 6 months old at well-child visits (/English/family-life/health-management/Pages/Well-Child-Care-A

### Check-Up-for-Success.aspx). It is painted on the top and sides of each tooth and hardens quickly. Then, it is brushed off 

### after 4 to 12 hours. It is recommended that children have varnish applied 2 to 4 times per year until they are 5 years 

### old. 

## Q: What should I know about fluoride if I am breastfeeding or using 

## infant formula? 

### A : When they are younger than 6 months old, breastfed (http://www.healthychildren.org/english/ages

### stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/default.aspx) babies and babies fed infant formula do not need fluoride 

### supplements or formula mixed with water than is fluoridated. It is safe to use fluoridated water to mix 

### (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Formula-Form-and-Function

### Powders-Concentrates-and-Ready-to-Feed.aspx) the formula if your baby is younger than 6 months old, but there is a 

### small risk of "fluorosis." (See more details, below.) Ask your pediatrician 

### (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/prenatal/decisions-to-make/Pages/Finding-a-Pediatrician.aspx) 

### or dentist (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/family-life/health-management/pediatric

### specialists/Pages/What-is-a-Pediatric-Dentist.aspx) if you need more advice. 

### If you prefer not to use fluoridated water with formula before your baby's first tooth emerges, you can: 

### Use bottled or purified water that has no fluoride with the formula. 

### Use ready-to-feed formula that does not need water to be added. 

## Q: What is dental fluorosis, and will fluoridated water mixed with 

## infant formula increase the risk? 

### A: Fluorosis usually appears as very faint white streaks on the teeth. Often it is only noticeable by a dental expert 

### during an exam. Mild fluorosis is not painful and does not affect the function or health of the teeth. 

### Although using fluoridated water to prepare infant formula might increase the risk of dental fluorosis, most cases are 

### mild. 

### (http://www.ada.org/5576.aspx?currentTab=1) 

### Once your child's adult teeth come in (usually around age 8), the risk of developing fluorosis is over.
