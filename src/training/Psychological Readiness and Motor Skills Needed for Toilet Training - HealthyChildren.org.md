# Psychological Readiness and Motor Skills Needed for 

# Toilet Training 

## All parents are familiar with the routine of feeding breast milk or formula to a baby and then 

## immediately changing her diaper after her meal. At times the diaper-wetting response occurs so 

## quickly that it seems the milk has gone into one end of the baby and straight through to the 

## diaper at the other end. This involuntary elimination process occurs because a baby’s digestive 

## system has not yet fully matured. 

## While urine fills the baby’s bladder and is released through the urethra, and bowel movements 

## fill the large intestine and are expelled via the rectum, just as with adults, babies cannot yet 

## control the circular sphincter muscles that keep the bladder and rectum closed. As a baby’s 

## stomach fills during a feeding and passes more fluid to the bladder, the sphincter muscles automatically relax, and 

## urination or a bowel movement occurs. 

## As long as this process remains involuntary, until at least eighteen months in most cases, a baby is unable to 

## consciously delay elimination. If placed on a potty at the right time, she will void into it, but she cannot deliberately 

## wait to use the potty and so cannot be fully toilet-trained. 

## Awareness of the Need to Go 

## At around her first birthday, your child will begin for the first time to recognize the sensation of a full rectum or 

## bladder, signaling a need to eliminate. In many cases, your child will show her awareness through her behavior: 

## squatting and grunting when she is about to have a bowel movement or tugging at her diaper when she needs to 

## urinate. 

## Even though she will still not be able to delay the function she senses taking place, it is a good idea to reinforce this 

## awareness of the link between the inner feeling of fullness and the act of excretion or urination. When you see that 

## she is about to eliminate, comment neutrally: “Oops, I think a poop [or pee] is coming. Do you feel it happening?” 

## Once she has soiled or wet her diaper, change it right away to reinforce the concept that bowel movements and urine 

## should be removed from the body and discarded. There is no need to comment negatively on this natural process 

## (words such as dirty or messy will only make your child feel bad), but you can certainly say positive things about how 

## good it feels and smells to be clean and dry. 

## Your goal is to strengthen your child’s awareness of the feeling of needing to go so that she can build on this 

## understanding when the time comes, and to encourage her to see toilet training as a desirable skill. 

## Motor Skills 

## In addition to his physiological development, your child’s motor skills must reach a certain level of maturity before he 

## can easily begin toilet training. 

## The ability to walk (beginning at around twelve months) is an obvious asset in getting to the potty in time to use it. 

## During the early months of learning to walk, your child’s preoccupation with practicing this new skill will probably 

## leave little energy for experimenting with potty use. As he grows more comfortable with getting around on two legs, 

## however (by around eighteen to twenty-four months), he may become interested in acquiring other “grown-up” skills. 

## The gradual improvement in other gross and fine motor skills, which usually begins at around eighteen months, will 

## support your child’s ability to handle his clothing more efficiently and to engage in activities that may keep him 

## seated on the potty long enough to eliminate successfully. 

## You can encourage these developments by teaching him to dress and undress himself, making sure that his clothing 

## is easy to remove, and offering him picture books, toys, or crayons and paper to play with while he’s waiting for a bowel 

## movement to occur. The ability to master all of these new skills also greatly enhances young children’s self-esteem— 

## confidence that comes in handy as they meet the toilet-training challenge.
