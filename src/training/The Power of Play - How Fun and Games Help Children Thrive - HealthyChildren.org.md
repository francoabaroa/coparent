# The Power of Play How Fun and Games Help Children 

# Thrive 

## More than just a chance to have fun, play is serious 

## business when it comes to a child's health and 

## development. From peek-a-boo to pat-a-cake and hide

## and-seek to hopscotch, the many forms of play enrich a 

## child's brain, body, and life in important ways. 

## The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) clinical 

## report, The Power of Play: A Pediatric Role in 

## Enhancing Development in Young Children 

## (http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/p 

## eds.2018-2058), explains how and why playing with both 

## parents and peers is key to building thriving brains, 

## bodies, and social bonds―all important in today's world. 

## Research shows play can improve children's abilities to plan, organize, get along with others, and regulate emotions. In 

## addition, play helps with language, math and social skills, and even helps children cope with stress. 

## A Prescription for Play 

## Despite its many benefits, statistics show that the amount of time children get to play has been 

## declining for decades. Tightly structured family and school schedules, more parents working 

## outside the home, fewer safe places to play, and rising media use and screen time are among the 

## reasons. For example, research shows the average preschooler watches 4.5 hours of TV each day! 

## To help keep play a key part of childhood, pediatricians may begin writing a "prescription for play" at every 

## well-child visit through age 2. Pediatricians also advise parents to look for quality child care or preschool 

## programs (/English/family-life/work-play/Pages/Why-Quality-Matters-in-Early-Child-Care.aspx) that include 

## playful approaches to learning. 

## Age-Specific Ideas for Playful Learning 

## Learning is best fueled by tapping into a child's natural urge to play, rather than just outside factors like test scores. As 

## they actively engage with and joyfully discover their world, children gain 21st century skills that increasingly call for 

## teamwork and innovation. 

## Birth to 6 Months 

## The AAP encourages parents to use play to help meet their child's health and developmental milestones, beginning 

## from birth. Some examples of ways to do this: 

## Playful learning can start with a baby's first smile. Responding with a smile of your own is a form of play that also 

## teaches a baby a critical social-emotional skill: "You can get my attention and a smile from me anytime you 

## want ― just by smiling yourself." 

## Imitate your baby's coos and babbles and have back-and-forth "conversation" using your baby's sounds as a 

## prompt. 


##### Show your baby interesting objects such as a brightly colored toy. Let her bring safe objects to her mouth to 

##### explore and experience new textures. 

##### Place your baby in different positions so he can see the world from different angles. 

### 7 to 12 Months 

##### Make sure your baby has a safe environment to crawl and explore. 

##### Give your baby opportunities to learn that her actions have effects—for example, when she drops a toy and it falls 

##### to the ground. Put a few toys within reach of your baby so he can take toys out and play with them. 

##### Use a mirror to show your baby her different facial expressions. 

##### Play peek-a-boo. 

### 1 to 3 Years 

##### When choosing childcare and preschools, look for those that include unstructured playtime. Playful learning, 

##### where children take the lead and follow their own curiosity, should be the main focus of high-quality early 

##### childhood education. 

##### Give your child blocks, empty containers, wooden spoons, and puzzles. Simple and inexpensive objects are some 

##### of the best ways to support a child's creativity. Remember, it is parents and caregivers' presence and attention 

##### that enriches children―not fancy electronic gadgets. 

##### Give your child opportunities to play with peers. This is a good age to try a parent-supervised playdate. 

##### Help your child explore her body through different movements—for example, walking, jumping, and standing on 

##### one leg. 

##### Provide opportunities for make-believe play—for example, pretending to drink out of an empty cup or offering 

##### toys that enable pretend play. 

##### Read regularly to and with your child. Encourage pretend play based on these stories. 

##### Sing songs and play rhythms so that your child can learn and join in the fun. Begin to introduce some age

##### appropriate games like Simon Says. 

### 4 to 6 Years 

##### Provide opportunities for your child to sing and dance. 

##### Tell stories to your child and ask questions about what he or she remembers. 

##### Give your child time and space to act out imaginary scenes, roles, and activities. 

##### Allow your child to move between make-believe games and reality—for example, playing house and helping you 

##### with chores. 

##### Schedule time for your child to interact with friends to practice socializing and building friendships. 

##### Encourage your child to try a variety of movements in a safe environment—for example, hopping, swinging, 

##### climbing, and doing somersaults. 

##### Limit screen time to healthy levels. Age-appropriate media can have benefits for older children, especially if you 

##### watch and play with them. But real time social interactions and play are much better for children than digital 

##### media for learning. 

##### Encourage your child's school to offer recess and playful learning approaches in addition to more structured 

##### learning approaches like reading, memorization and worksheets. 

## Play as a Toxic Stress Buster 

##### In addition to boosting a child's health and development, play helps to build the safe, stable and nurturing 

##### relationships that buffer against toxic stress and build social-emotional resilience. The mutual joy and one-on-one 

##### interaction that happens during play can manage the body's stress response, according to the AAP. In one study, 3to 4

##### year-old children, anxious about entering preschool, were two times more likely to feel less stressed when allowed to 

##### play for 15 minutes, compared to classmates who listened to a story. 

## Types of Play: Mix it Up 

##### Different types of play have different benefits for children: 

### Toys and Object Play 

##### When playing with an object such as a toy, babies are using their sensory-motor skills to explore its properties and 

##### conduct "experiments" like a tiny scientist might. To learn if an object is solid, for example, they might bang it on the 

##### floor. Preschool-age children also use objects to develop abstract thought and concepts like symbolism, using a 

##### banana as a telephone, for example, along with sharing and taking turns. 

### Physical Play 

##### Physical fun such as free play during recess helps develop children's motor skills, prevent childhood obesity and 

##### build emotional intelligence. The gentle thrill of a playground (/English/safety-prevention/at-play/Pages/Safety-on

##### the-Playground.aspx) slide, for example, lets a child build confidence as they take risks in a relatively safe 

##### environment. Games such as duck-duck-goose and tag also help children build other socio-emotional skills such as 

##### empathy as children learn to be careful not to hurt others by tapping someone too hard, for example. 

### Outdoor Play 

##### Outdoor play, is particularly important because it lets children use all their senses to build skills like spatial 

##### awareness and balance. It can also improve a child's attention span. Studies suggest that young children in countries 

##### where schools allow more time for recess (https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/131/1/183/30893/The

##### Crucial-Role-of-Recess-in-School) see more academic success as children get older, yet an estimated 30% of U.S. 

##### kindergarten children no longer have recess. 

### Pretend Play 

##### This type of play lets young children experiment with different social roles and learn to cooperate. Dress up, make 

##### believe, and imaginary play also encourage creativity and builds more complex negotiation, communication and 

#### language skills. (" You be the teacher, and I will be the student," a child might say.) 

## Remember... 

##### Giving your child plenty of opportunities to play is one of the best ways to help them grow into curious, creative, 

##### healthy, and happy adults equipped with the skills they need today. Next time your child asks to play with you, jump at 

##### the opportunity! Share the joy of discovery as you connect with each other and the world around you.
