# Poison Prevention: One Pill Can Kill 

## By Elizabeth Murray, DO, MBA, FAAP 

## Kids are curious—and they sure do love putting things 

## in their mouths! Exploring what objects feel and taste 

## like is part of how they learn about the world around 

## them. Children’s non-stop curiosity is what brings all 

## the great (and sometimes silly) questions and creativity, 

## but it can also lead to trouble. 

## Some days as an emergency medicine doctor, I feel like 

## I’ve seen it all. From a marshmallow stuck in a child’s 

## airway (/English/health-issues/injuries

## emergencies/Pages/Choking-Prevention.aspx) to a 

## child with lead poisoning after swallowing a small toy (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/How-to-Buy-Safe

## Toys.aspx) to keep it away from his little brother. Sometimes, these emergencies hit close to home. 

## The Gillans’ story below may be hard to read but brings to life how important it is to do all we can to keep our kids safe. 

## One Pill Can Kill 

## By MaryBeth and Adam Gillan 

## Our beautiful, happy daughter Maisie died from a methadone overdose at 9 months and 15 days old. No one in our 

## house is prescribed methadone. In our neighbor’s house, where she found the pill that killed her, no one (to our 

## knowledge) is prescribed methadone. 

## However, over the holidays, a relative who was prescribed methadone visited the neighbors' house. A few days later 

## at a dinner party Maisie showed off her new ability to crawl for delighted onlookers. Unknown to us, the relative lost 

## a pill in the kitchen and did not recover it. The pill found Maisie’s hand and her hand found her mouth. Six adults, 

## three of them doctors, were at the party and Maisie was supervised the entire time. We left the party around her 

## bedtime. She appeared sleepy, so we told her we loved her and put her to bed. 

## Hours later she was dead. We found her unresponsive the following morning, performed CPR and called first 

## responders immediately. We were hoping for a miracle. We were hoping our baby would be saved and we would 

## hold her again. We buried her six days later. There are open plots on either side of Maisie’s headstone for her 

## parents. It wasn’t supposed to be this way. 

## For 10 days, it was assumed that Maisie dies of SIDS (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/Preventing

## SIDS.aspx)but we eventually found out she died from an overdose from an adult dosage of methadone. Medicine can 

## and does save lives, but we do not treat it with the care and security that we should. Medicine needs to be accounted 

## for, it needs to be locked away, and it needs to be distributed in single unit doses, also known as blister packaging. 

## Talk about safe storage and safe handling with everyone you know who takes medications. They can be hard 

## conversations, but one pill can kill, and we do not want it to happen to you or your loved ones. 


## Maisie’s story how common is it? 

### We know that about 50,000 U.S. children visit the Emergency Department every year because they swallowed 

### something potentially dangerous. The good news, most of those children go home without having suffered any 

### serious harm. The scary news is that about 9,000 children need to be hospitalized, and some, like Maisie, die from the 

### poisoning. 

### Medicines are powerful lifesavers, but can also be dangerous—especially to babies, children and teens. 

## Think "up and away" 

### The best way to protect kids from unintentional poisoning is to put medicines away (/English/safety-prevention/at

### home/medication-safety/Pages/Medication-Safety-Tips.aspx) safely. Use these tips to keep children from finding 

### medicines in your home: 

### Store all medications in a cupboard or high shelf, well out of a child’s sight. In about half of over-the-counter 

### medication (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/medication-safety/Pages/Using-Over-the-Counter-Medicines

### With-Your-Child.aspx) poisonings, the child climbed onto a chair, toy or other object to reach the medication. 

### Keep medicines in their original containers, with child-safety caps. 

### If there are controlled substances (like prescription pain medications or ADHD (/English/health

### issues/conditions/adhd/Pages/Determining-ADHD-Medication-Treatments.aspx) medicine) consider using a 

### locked box for extra safety. 

### Keep track of how many pills are in the bottle and write the start date on the label. This way, if a spill occurs, you’ll 

### know if any are missing. 

### When giving your child medicine, lean over a counter or table. This helps contain any accidental spills. 

### Any medication can be dangerous, so treat all products with the same respect. We worry about opioids, but some 

### blood pressure and diabetes medications can be fatal to a toddler who swallows only one pill. 

### If a medication spills, vacuum or sweep the area as an extra precaution to ensure nothing is missed. 

### Dispose of unused medications—especially opioids (/English/ages-stages/teen/substance-abuse/Pages/The

### Opioid-Epidemic.aspx)—at pharmacies, drug "take back" programs or doctors’ offices 

### Know basic first aid (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/First-Aid-Guide.aspx) and keep the Poison 

### Center Number (1-800-222-1222) stored in your phone. 

### Get into the practice of safe medication storage, starting as soon as your baby is born. 

## That terrible morning 

### I’ve known the Gillan family for years. On the morning Maisie died, I was the on-call physician for 

### the team that reviews all unexpected deaths of children. The phone calls started to come in. First 

### the investigators, asking if I thought they were missing anything. Her room was perfect, all safe 

### sleep guidelines were followed, the house was completely child-safe. 

### Then my mother called, as soon as she heard. Since we knew the family so well, this might have 

### been the hardest of the calls to take. A wonderful, happy, healthy and so very loved little child had 

### been lost, and the family was devastated. 

### I am honored to have been gifted a "Maisie pin" that I wear on my white coat. It serves as a launch point to talk to 

### families about poisoning prevention so that maybe, no other families have to suffer.
