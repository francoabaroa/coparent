# Reversing Day-Night Reversal 

## Some babies, however, settle into the newborn sleep routine dreaded by many expectant parents 

## —the so-called day-night reversal. As the description implies, newborns are known on occasion 

## to mix up their days and nights. These temporarily backward-sleeping babies often begin to 

## increase the amount of sleep they get each time they go to sleep according to plan, but simply do 

## so more during the day while demanding to be fed, changed, and entertained throughout the 

## night. As painfully exhausting as this upside-down approach to sleep may be for those of us 

## accustomed to getting most if not all of our sleep at night, the assurance that this too shall pass 

## once again comes to mind. We can all but guarantee you that hope is not far away. In most 

## instances, the fact that your newborn is learning to replace lots of short little catnaps with longer 

## stretches of sleep—whether they happen to fall during the day or at night—bodes well for a more “civilized” sleep 

## routine in your not too distant future. 

## Lights On, Lights Off 

## If your baby seems determined to “play” during the night and sleep during the day there’s really no quick fix, but 

## there are some easy things you can do early on to set the stage for more acceptable sleep habits in the future. During 

## your first few weeks at home with your baby, try to establish an atmosphere that clearly differentiates night from day. 

## A good night’s rest may not result overnight, but this approach can help get you there sooner. 

## Allow for active sleep. During the day, don't worry if your baby falls asleep in more "active" areas of the house 

## in rooms with light or music on, for example. Similarly, don't be afraid to run an occasional daytime errand, even 

## if this means your newborn may not quite make it all the way home before falling asleep. 

## Consistent contrast. Don’t spend much time worrying about background noises such as talking, telephones, or 

## music during daylight hours. In contrast, try to make your nighttime interactions calm and quiet. 

## Maintain focus. Whenever possible, take a more focused approach to your nighttime interactions—limiting 

## them to feeding, burping, changing, and gentle soothing when necessary. 

## Soft-spoken approach. Get in the habit of taking the aforementioned measures in a dark room using a soft voice 

## whenever you want to signal to your newborn that it would be a fine time to sleep.
