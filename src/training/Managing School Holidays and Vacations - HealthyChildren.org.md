# Managing School Holidays and Vacations 

## Not surprisingly, some single and working parents have grown to dread school vacations, legal 

## holidays (like Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Washington's Birthday), and "teacher in-service 

## days." These are days when the child is out of school but parents usually have to be at work. To 

## make matters worse, care givers whom you might rely on at other times of the year often ask for 

## time off during holidays, and community activities like art classes and Scouting often are 

## cancelled too. 

## The good side of these situations is that you know they are coming and can plan for them. To help 

## in that process, get copies of your child's school schedule as early as possible so you are aware of 

## vacations several months in advance. Children's vacation schedules often dictate family vacation plans. With 

## sufficient advance notice, you may be able to block out your own vacation time to coincide with that of your youngster. 

## Few parents have as much vacation time available as do their children, so arrangements have to be made for child care 

## and supervision within the frame work of the demands of the parents' jobs. If your spouse has some flexibility in his or 

## her work schedule, divide the home responsibilities so one of you takes time off during different parts of the 

## children's vacation. Some couples are able to work out a plan where Mom is home in the morning, and Dad replaces 

## her in the afternoon; perhaps one or both can work flexible schedules (6 A.M. to 2 P.M.; 2:30 P.M. to 10:30 P.M.) So that at 

## least one parent is home at all times. 

## Fortunately, businesses are becoming more sensitive to the family needs of their employees. The federal Medical and 

## Family Leave Act of 1993 is helpful to parents upon the birth or adoption of a child, or when a child is ill, but it does not 

## have any provisions covering school holidays and vacations. 

## Sometimes neither you nor your spouse will be able to get off work. Or you will need a backup or alternative strategy 

## for unexpected job demands or the sudden loss of a caretaker, both of which require some last-minute juggling of 

## schedules. It is important that school-age children are always supervised, directly if possible and indirectly if not. 

## Indirect supervision means providing a safe environment and a structured schedule of activities, including regular 

## times to check in, even by phone, with a responsible adult. This latter option should be considered only for mature 

## preteenagers and is never the preferred alternative. 

## When you can't break away from the office, another option is to call upon extended family members to help. Some 

## parents are able to work out a timetable with several families, where each assumes the caretaking responsibilities for 

## all the children one day a week, or they trade hours of babysitting with each other. Some high school and college 

## students, or after-school child care employees, are willing to work on holidays, perhaps coming to your home to 

## assume the care of the children from several families. (Many high schools and colleges have job-placement offices to 

## find employment for students on vacation; ask for and check references before hiring these young adults for child 

## care.) You may also inquire about special holiday programs and camps that might be planned by local YMCAs, Boys 

## and Girls Clubs, and other com munity organizations. If none exist, gather some parents together and, as a group, urge 

## local organizations or city leaders to provide holiday activities for children. 

## For some parents of school-age children, the best long-term solution is to work at home all the time, often in a small 

## home-based business of their own. However, while this can be an ideal option, it is not available to everyone, and 

## working at home poses problems of its own.
