# Responding To Your Baby's Cries 

## Crying serves several useful purposes for your baby. It 

## allows her to call for help when she's hungry or 

## uncomfortable. It shuts out sights, sounds, and other 

## sensations too intense to suit her. And it helps her 

## release tension. 

## You may notice your baby has fussy periods, even when 

## she's not hungry, uncomfortable, or tired. At times it 

## may seem like nothing can console her. Right after 

## these spells, she may seem more alert than before, and 

## then may sleep more deeply than usual. This kind of 

## fussy crying seems to help babies get rid of excess 

## energy to allow for a more contented state. 

## As you get to know your infant's crying patterns, you may feel as if you can identify specific needs by the way she cries. 

## Is she hungry? Angry? Distressed or in pain? Sleepy? Each baby will use her voice differently. 

## Different types of cries 

## Sometimes different types of cries overlap. Newborns generally wake up hungry and crying for food. If you're not 

## quick to respond, your baby's hunger cry may turn to a wail of rage. You'll hear the difference. As your baby matures, 

## her cries will become stronger, louder, and more insistent. They'll also begin to vary more, as if to convey different 

## needs and desires. 

## The best way to handle crying is to respond promptly during her first few months. You cannot spoil a young baby with 

## attention, and if you answer her calls for help, she'll cry less overall. 

## When responding to your child's cries, try to meet her most pressing need first. If she's cold and hungry and her 

## diaper is wet, warm her up, change her diaper, and then feed her. If there's a shrieking or panicked quality to the cry, 

## consider if a piece of clothing or something else is making her uncomfortable. Perhaps a strand of hair is caught 

## around a finger or toe. If she's warm, dry, and well fed but the crying won't stop, try the following consoling techniques. 

## Find the ones that work best for your baby: 

## Rocking, either in a rocking chair or in your arms as you sway from side to side 

## Gently stroking her head or patting her back or chest 

## Safe swaddling (wrapping her snugly in a receiving blanket) 

## Singing or talking 

## Playing soft music 

## Walking her in your arms, a stroller, or a carriage 

## Rhythmic white noise and vibration 

## Burping her to relieve any trapped gas bubbles 

## Warm baths (most babies like this, but not all) 

## When all else fails 

## Sometimes, if all else fails, the best approach is simply to leave the baby alone in a safe location such as a crib. Many 

## babies cannot fall asleep without crying and will fall asleep quicker if left to cry. The crying shouldn't last long if the 

## child is truly tired.

### If the crying does not stop, but gets more intense and continues throughout the day or night, it may be caused by colic 

### (/English/tips-tools/symptom-checker/Pages/symptomviewer.aspx?symptom=Crying+Baby+

### +Before+3+Months+Old). Most often, colic means simply that the child is unusually sensitive to stimulation or 

### can't yet console herself. As your baby matures, this inability to self-console—marked by constant crying—will 

### improve. 

### In breastfeeding (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/default.aspx) babies, sometimes colic is a sign of 

### sensitivity to a food in the mother's diet. Colic drops are expensive, and studies suggest that they're not effective. You 

### can look into more non-medication options such as tweaks to your diet, slow feeding, and appropriate burping to help. 

### If your baby is inconsolable, she may be sick. Check her temperature (/English/health

### issues/conditions/fever/Pages/How-to-Take-a-Childs-Temperature.aspx). If you take it rectally and it is 100.4 degrees 

### Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) or higher, she could have an infection. Contact your pediatrician. 

### The more relaxed you remain, the easier it will be to console your child. Even very young babies are sensitive to 

### tension and react to it by crying. Hearing a wailing newborn can be agonizing, but letting your frustration turn to 

### anger or panic will only intensify your infant's screams. 

## Taking a break 

### If you start to feel you can't handle the situation, set the baby down in a safe location and get help from a family 

### member or friend. This will give you needed relief, and a new face can sometimes calm your baby. No matter how 

### impatient or angry you feel, do not shake or hit the baby. Shaking an infant (/English/safety-prevention/at

### home/Pages/Abusive-Head-Trauma-Shaken-Baby-Syndrome.aspx) hard can cause blindness, brain damage, or even 

### death. It's important to share this information on crying with anyone else who cares for your baby, including your 

### spouse, partner, or babysitter. 

## Remember 

### Above all, don't take your newborn's crying personally. She's not crying because you're a bad parent or because she 

### doesn't like you. All babies cry, often without any apparent cause. Newborns routinely cry one to four hours a day. It's 

### part of adjusting to this strange new life outside the womb. 

### No parent can console his or her child every time she cries, so don't expect to be a miracle worker. Instead, take a 

### realistic approach. Line up some help, get plenty of rest, and enjoy all those wondrous moments with your child.
