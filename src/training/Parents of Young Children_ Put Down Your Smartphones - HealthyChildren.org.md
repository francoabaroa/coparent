# Parents of Young Children: Put Down Your Smartphones 

## Too much tech and too little talk could delay communication 

## development. 

## Parents today are more pressed for time than any other generation 

## of parents—and constantly connected. Largely thanks to the 

## smartphone, parents often find it difficult to separate from their 

## hand-held devices. Checking your phone has become both habit 

## and necessity to manage work and family life (/English/family

## life/family-dynamics/Pages/The-Importance-of-Family

## Routines.aspx). But, all this multitasking could also hurt your young 

## child's ability to learn. 

## Ways to Enhance Your Child's Communication Skills 

## You spend so much time making sure your child eats right, has all of their recommended vaccines (/English/safety

## prevention/immunizations/Pages/Recommended-Immunization-Schedules.aspx), and gets enough rest. Yet, his or 

## her communication and social development is just as important. Children gain communication and social skills 

## through listening, talking, reading, singing, and playing with their parents—interactions lost while you are on a 

## smartphone. 

## Here are three ways parents can enhance their child's communication skills. 

## 1. Play Non-Electronic Games: Nursery rhymes (/English/ages-stages/preschool/nutrition-fitness/Pages/Motor

## Activity-and-Self-Play.aspx) such as peekaboo, pat-a-cake, and Itsy Bitsy Spider actually serve an important 

## purpose: they promote face-to-face interaction, teach turn-taking, and reinforce essential parts of bonding and 

## conversation. Activities like blowing kisses, waving bye-bye, and clapping all help a child build social interaction 

## and conversation skills. These games all require free hands—for both children and parents! 

## 2. Share a Common Focus: Read a book together (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Developmental-Milestones

## of-Early-Literacy.aspx), share a toy, look at the same dog in a park. When two people focus on the same thing at 

## the same time, they are engaging in what is called "joint attention." Joint attention is a vital part of 

## communication and language development (/English/ages-stages/toddler/Pages/Language-Development-2

## Year-Olds.aspx). It is also an important social skill, allowing a child to share an experience with another person 

## and see someone else's point of view. Sharing focus lets a child know you are interested in what they say or do. 

## When parents are on their cell phones, they are not fully focused on the same points of attention as their child 

## and miss key opportunities to build this skill. 

## 3. Send and Receive Nonverbal Messages: Speaking and understanding words are just part of the 

## communication puzzle. Non-verbal signals such as eye contact, facial expressions, gestures, and body language 

## provide additional information. A child is able to recognize emotions and understand the intent of a message. 

## When a parent is using a smartphone, these nonverbal cues are often reduced or eliminated completely. As a 

## result, children miss out on receiving important nonverbal signals from their parents (part of learning to 

## communicate). Parents may also miss information their kids are trying to send them through pointing, 

## gesturing, staring, etc. These are subtle, but vital signals young children send—especially when they don't speak 

## many words yet (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Language-Development-8-to-12-Months.aspx). 

## Tips for Parents Who Feel Tech-Overloaded 

## Smartphones can be a way to connect with others and make our lives easier, but their overuse can interfere with 

## parent-child interactions. While it may be difficult to keep your phone out of sight completely (especially since most 

## parents also use their phones to take photos and videos of their kids), carving out some boundaries to promote 

## technology use in a healthy way can help.

### Here are some suggestions: 

##### Create regular tech-free times: As part of the daily routine, make devices (e.g., televisions, phones, computers, 

##### games or other electronics) off limits at specific times. Dinnertime and before bedtime are important ones, but 

##### more extended breaks from technology each day are desirable, especially for families with very young children. 

##### You can also limit digital distractions by creating tech-free rooms/zones in the house, such as the kitchen table 

##### (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/Pages/Mealtime-as-Family-Time.aspx). If you're sitting around the table 

##### texting while eating, you are not connecting. Teach your child to connect by connecting. 

##### Designate tech-free outings: A trip to the farm or the zoo, a playdate in the park, a day at the pool. Most parents 

##### love taking pictures of their kids and sharing moments on Facebook, but an activity can go undocumented every 

##### once in a while. Putting the phone away allows everyone to enjoy a fun, uninterrupted moments to focus on 

##### talking and communicating with each other. 

##### Use technology in an interactive way: If you are using a phone or other device, use it with your kids—together. 

##### Talk about what you see, ask them questions, and otherwise engage them face-to-face. 

#### See Kids & Tech: 10 Tips for Parents in the Digital Age (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/Tips-for-Parents

#### Digital-Age.aspx) for more ideas. 

## Why YOU Can't Be Replaced by Technology 

##### The development of speech and language skills (http://www.asha.org/public/speech/development/) is strongly linked 

##### to thinking ability, social relationships, reading and writing, and school success. In the first three years of life, 80% of a 

##### child's brain development occurs. This development is fed through consistent verbal and nonverbal interactions 

##### between parents and children, so it is important to keep the focus on quality time and not on technology whenever 

##### you can. 

##### Does this mean that we need to put down our smartphones completely? Of course not; but nothing takes the place of 

##### face-to-face interaction when it comes to our children's learning and speech and language development—not even 

##### technology.
