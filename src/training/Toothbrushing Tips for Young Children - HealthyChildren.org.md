# Toothbrushing Tips for Young Children 

## Each child has different skills and needs that can guide parents in helping him or her brush. 

## Tips to Help Young Children Practice Brushing & Make It 

## A Good Experience: 

## Choosing a toothbrush. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush designed for brushing an infant’s or 

## child’s teeth. 

## Holding a toothbrush. If the child has trouble holding a toothbrush, try making the handle thicker by putting it 

## inside a tennis ball. The toothbrush handle can also be strapped to the child’s hand with a wide rubber band, a 

## hair band, or Velcro. Toothbrushes with thick handles can also be found in retail and discount stores. 

## Teaching the child how to brush. Break the process into small steps that the child can understand and practice. 

## Ask a dentist (/English/family-life/health-management/pediatric-specialists/Pages/What-is-a-Pediatric

## Dentist.aspx), dental hygienist, occupational therapist (/English/health-issues/conditions/developmental

## disabilities/Pages/Occupational-Therapy.aspx), or early childhood specialist for help, if needed. Another way is to 

## place a hand over the child’s hand to guide the toothbrush as the child brushes. 

## Using toothpaste with fluoride. Use toothpaste with fluoride (/English/healthy-living/oral-health/Pages/FAQ

## Fluoride-and-Children.aspx) that the child likes and that feels good in his or her mouth. An adult should always 

## place toothpaste on the toothbrush. 

## For children under age 3: Use a small smear of flouride toothpaste (or an amount about the size of a grain 

## of rice). 

## For children ages 3–6: Use a pea-size amount of flouride toothpaste. 

## If a child cannot spit: Have the child tilt his or her mouth down so that the toothpaste can dribble out into 

## the sink, a cup, or a washcloth. Since the fluoride in toothpaste is clearly meant to be swishes but not 

## swallowed, make sure to help or watch the child while brushing. When she is old enough, tell her to spit out 

## the toothpaste after brushing. 

## Positioning the child. There are many ways a child can be positioned to make the child feel comfortable and 

## allow an adult to brush his or her teeth. 

## Keeping the child engaged in brushing. Use a timer, a short song, or counting as a game to encourage brushing 

## for 2 minutes.
