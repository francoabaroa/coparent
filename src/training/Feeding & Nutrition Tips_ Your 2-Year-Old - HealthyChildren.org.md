# Feeding & Nutrition Tips: Your 2-Year-Old 

## With your two-year-old (/English/ages-stages/Your

## Childs-Checkups/Pages/your-checkup-checklist-24

## months-2-Years-Old.aspx)'s blossoming language and 

## social skills, they're ready to become an active 

## mealtime participant. They should no longer be 

## drinking from a bottle, and can eat the same food as the 

## rest of the family. Their diet should now include three 

## healthy meals (/English/ages

## stages/toddler/nutrition/Pages/Sample-One-Day

## Menu-for-a-Two-Year-Old.aspx) a day, plus one or two 

## snacks (/English/ages

## stages/toddler/nutrition/Pages/Selecting-Snacks-for

## Toddlers.aspx). 

## Here are some tips to help your little one develop healthy, safe eating habits and get the nutrition their growing bodies 

## need. 

## Mealtime tips for toddlers 

## Try not to fixate on amounts of food they are eating. 

## Avoid making mealtimes a battle. 

## Pay attention to adopting healthy eating habits—including sitting as a family (/English/family-life/family

## dynamics/Pages/Mealtime-as-Family-Time.aspx) at mealtime. 

## Focus on making healthy food choices (/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/nutrition/Pages/Making-Healthy

## Food-Choices.aspx) as a family. 

## Unsafe foods for toddlers: choking risks 

## At two years old, your child should be able to use a spoon, drink from a cup with just one hand, and feed themselves a 

## wide variety of finger foods. However, they are still learning to chew and swallow efficiently and may gulp food down 

## when in a hurry to get on with playing. For that reason, the risk of choking (/English/health-issues/injuries

## emergencies/Pages/Choking-Prevention.aspx) at this age is high. 

## Avoid these foods, which could be swallowed whole and block the windpipe: 

## Hot dogs (unless cut in quarters lengthwise before being sliced) 

## Chunks of peanut butter (Peanut butter may be spread thinly on bread or a cracker, but never give chunks of 

## peanut butter to a toddler.) 

## Nuts—especially peanuts 

## Raw cherries with pits 

## Round, hard candies—including jelly beans 

## Gum 

## Whole grapes 

## Marshmallows 


#### Raw carrots, celery, green beans 

#### Popcorn 

#### Seeds—such as processed pumpkin or sunflower seeds 

#### Whole grapes, cherry tomatoes (cut them in quarters) 

#### Large chunks of any food such as meat, potatoes, or raw vegetables and fruits 

## Healthy eating basics & selective eaters (/English/tips-tools/ask-the

## pediatrician/Pages/How-Do-I-Help-My-Picky-Eater-Try-More

## Foods.aspx) 

#### The best foods for toddlers include: 

#### Protein foods like meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, nuts, seeds and soy 

#### Dairy such as milk, yogurt, cheese or calcium-fortified soymilk 

#### Fruits and vegetables 

#### Grains such as whole wheat bread and oatmeal 

#### It is normal for toddlers to choose from a limited number of foods, reject foods entirely, and then change their 

#### preferences over time. Never force your child to eat something they do not want to eat. The best approach is to let 

#### your child to choose from 2 to 3 healthy options, and continue to offer new foods as their tastes (/English/tips

#### tools/ask-the-pediatrician/Pages/How-Do-I-Help-My-Picky-Eater-Try-More-Foods.aspx) change. 

#### Offering a variety of foods and leaving the choices up to your child will eventually allow them to eat a balanced diet on 

#### their own. Toddlers also like to feed themselves (/English/ages-stages/toddler/nutrition/Pages/Self-Feeding.aspx). So, 

#### whenever possible, offer your child finger foods instead of cooked ones that require a fork or spoon to eat. 

## Supplements for some children 

#### Vitamin supplements (/English/ages-stages/toddler/nutrition/Pages/Dietary-Supplements-for-Toddlers.aspx) are 

#### rarely necessary for toddlers who eat a varied diet, with a few exceptions. 

#### Vitamin D. Infants under 12 months of age require 400 International Units (IU) of vitamin D per day and older 

#### children and adolescents require 600 IU per day. This amount of vitamin D can prevent rickets (/English/healthy

#### living/nutrition/Pages/Vitamin-D-Deficiency-and-Rickets.aspx)—a condition characterized by the softening and 

#### weakening of bones. If your child is not regularly exposed to sunlight or is consuming enough vitamin D in their diet, 

### talk to your pediatrician about a vitamin D supplement. See Vitamin D for Babies, Children & Adolescents 

### (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Vitamin-D-On-the-Double.aspx) for more information and a list of vitamin D

### enriched foods. 

#### Iron. Supplemental iron may be needed if your child eats very little meat, iron-fortified cereal, or vegetables rich in 

#### iron. Large quantities of milk (more than 32 ounces [960 mL] per day) also may interfere with the proper absorption of 

#### iron, increasing the risk of iron deficiency anemia (/English/health-issues/conditions/chronic/Pages/Anemia-and

#### Your-Child.aspx). 

#### Calcium. Your child should drink 16 ounces (480 mL) of low-fat or nonfat milk each day. This will provide most of the 

#### calcium they need for bone growth and still not interfere with their appetite for other foods—particularly those that 

#### provide iron. 

#### Note: Children stay on whole milk until they are two years of age—unless there is a reason to switch a baby to low-fat 

#### milk sooner. Whole milk contains approximately 4% milk fat. It may help to gradually switch your child from whole 

#### milk to a lower-fat milk. Therefore, many pediatricians recommend that children get reduced fat (2%) milk for a few 

#### weeks before switching them to low fat (1%) or no fat (skim) milk.
