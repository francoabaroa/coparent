# NICU Nursing Team 

## Although many people think all nurses do the same things, nothing could be further from the 

## truth. All nurses do have knowledge that provides the foundation for nursing practice (achieved 

## through either an associate’s or bachelor’s degree), but most also choose an area of specialty and 

## acquire additional skills and expertise specific to that area. In addition, a nurse may hold an 

## advanced master’s or doctorate degree. 

## Your baby’s nurse is at the bedside more than any other professional. She is your baby’s caregiver 

## and advocate, as well as your primary source of information. 

## Registered Nurse 

## The person who provides the moment to moment care for your baby (besides you!) is your baby’s bedside nurse, 

## usually a registered nurse (RN). A neonatal nurse is an RN who is highly educated to provide nursing care for infants 

## and their families. The nurse caring for your baby learned NICU clinical skills through an extensive orientation 

## program and clinical preceptorship in the NICU. You may see an RN with the designation “RNC-NIC,” which means 

## the nurse has also passed a national specialty examination in neonatal intensive care nursing. 

## This person may be assigned to care for just your baby or for up to 3 additional babies. The staffing assignment is 

## determined by the skills of your nurse and how much support your baby requires at that time. 

## Nurses work collaboratively with physicians and other members of the health care team; they are not assistants. 

## Nurses function independently, and their specific roles vary depending on the setting. An RN may supervise a team of 

## other professionals and assistants who help care for patients. 

## Neonatal nurses are at your baby’s bedside 24 hours a day. They assess your baby’s current condition and progress, 

## carry out the physician’s orders, and notify the physician team (physician, neonatal nurse practitioner [NNP], or 

## neonatal physician assistant) of any changes in your baby’s status. The RN may make recommendations to the 

## physician or the team based on his or her assessment of your baby. The RN also plans and implements all nursing 

## care, such as bathing, feeding, positioning, administering prescribed medications, and managing intravenous (IV) and 

## arterial lines. In addition, RNs are very involved in parent education and discharge planning. 

## The nursing team is supported and led by a charge nurse who oversees the nursing operation for each nursing shift. 

## Behind the scenes, you will often find a NICU nurse manager who provides nursing supervision and leadership for the 

## whole unit and all of the nursing staff. 

## Clinical Nurse Specialist 

## A clinical nurse specialist (CNS) (or clinical nurse educator) helps advance the practice of the nursing team. A CNS is 

## an RN with an advanced degree who acts as an expert and resource person for nursing staff. Clinical nurse specialists 

## are involved in many different areas on the unit, including staff education, nursing research, quality improvement, 

## consultation, direct patient care, and program development. Together with the medical team and the nursing staff, the 

## CNS assists the NICU team with your baby’s care by making specific recommendations and offering new ideas or 

## techniques to ensure the best possible plan of care. 

## Licensed Practical Nurse/Licensed Vocational Nurse 

## A licensed practical nurse (LPN) or licensed vocational nurse (LVN) has graduated from a state-approved technical 

## school or community college and must pass a national written examination. The LPN/LVN provides basic bedside care 

## and works under the direction of an RN.
