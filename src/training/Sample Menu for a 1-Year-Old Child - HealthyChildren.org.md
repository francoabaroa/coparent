# Sample Menu for a 1-Year-Old Child 

## Babies and young toddlers should get about half of their 

## calories from fat. Healthy fats are very important for 

## normal growth and development at this stage of their 

## development. 

## All fats are not created equal, though. Healthy fats like 

## those found in avocado, olive oil, fish, nut butters, and 

## dairy are good for your child (and you). Unhealthy fats 

## such as those found in fried foods, fast foods and many 

## packaged foods are not healthy at any age. If you keep 

## your child's daily caloric intake at about 1,000 calories, 

## you needn't worry about overfeeding and risk of weight 

## gain 

## Here is a sample menu for a one-year-old child who weighs about 21 pounds (9.5 

## kg): 

## BREAKFAST 

## ½ cup iron-fortified breakfast cereal or 1 cooked egg 

## ½ cup whole or 2% milk 

## ½ banana, sliced 

## 2 to 3 large sliced strawberries 

## SNACK 

## 1 slice toast or whole-wheat muffin with 1–2 tablespoons cream cheese or peanut butter, or ½ cup yogurt with cut

## up fruit 

## Water or ½ cup whole or 2% milk 

## LUNCH 

## ½ sandwich: sliced turkey or chicken, tuna, egg salad or peanut butter 

## ½ cup cooked green vegetables 

## ½ cup whole or 2% milk 

## 1 cup = 8 ounces = 240 ml 

## 1 ounce = 2 tablespoons = 30 ml 

## ½ ounce = 1 tablespoon = 15 ml = 3 teaspoons 

## 1 teaspoon = ¹⁄³ tablespoon = 5 ml
