# Parenting Conflicts 

## My spouse and I have different ideas on parenting. How can we find 

## ways to agree? 

## As you and your spouse (or ex-spouse) share the responsibilities of parenting and managing the family's day-to-day 

## activities, problems will arise. Here are a few of the most common difficulties that today's parents encounter and how 

## you can handle them: 

## Inconsistency 

## Often parents differ in their rules and expectations for their child. Mom might say, "You can't watch TV until your 

## homework is finished"; but when she's away, Dad may say, "Go ahead and watch TV if you want to." Dad might insist that 

## the child's bedtime is 8:30; Mom may say that stretching it until 9:00 is fine. 

## Similar conflicts can develop over issues like approaches to discipline or a child's choice of friends. When these 

## inconsistencies occur, one parent inevitably undermines the authority of the other. 

## To begin to resolve this problem, you and your spouse need to be explicit with each other about what your rules and 

## expectations are. If necessary, write them down, review them and be sure they are workable. In areas in which you 

## differ, find a compromise that you both can live with and stick by it. 

## Non-Communication 

## If you and your spouse do not talk about the issues the family faces, one of you may be left out of important matters 

## you should be informed about. 

## To avoid this situation, you and your spouse need to commit yourselves to communicate about every significant issue 

## in your family life. At least once a day the two of you need to check in with each other and discuss what happened that 

## day that was important. At the same time, talk about long-term issues that may be confronting the family. 

## Confusion 

## Uncertainty about what stands to take and what rules to impose can create turmoil within the family. Too often, 

## parents are perplexed about issues like the degree of supervision required for their children and the amount of 

## freedom to give them. Parents frequently do not make decisions at all, and that can leave their children puzzled and 

## dismayed over what is expected of them. 

## You and your spouse need to resolve your own ambivalence on important family matters and agree on a position on 

## these issues. Then you must clearly inform the entire family about your decisions and how their own lives will be 

## affected by them. 

## Competition 

## Sometimes rivalry can develop between parents over their children's attention and love. If Dad wants his daughter to 

## spend Saturday afternoon fishing with him but Mom wants her to go shopping with her, they may struggle to get their 

## way, putting the child in an unenviable position, right in the middle of the conflict. 

## The two of you need to find ways to cooperate, not compete, with each other. That doesn't mean you have to agree on 

## everything; but it does mean that you are committed to working together toward a more harmonious relationship and 

## family life, and you are not going to let differences undermine your common goals. Each of you needs to demonstrate 

## some flexibility. 

## As you form ground rules for the family, identify the areas in which each parent excels. That parent should then exert 

## leadership in the areas of his or her strength, so the decision-making responsibilities are divided within the family.

## Overt Conflict 

### Too often, parents argue and openly challenge each other on family-related matters. Perhaps their child has gotten 

### into trouble at school, and the parents disagree about how to handle it; the mother may think the child should be 

### grounded, while the father believes it wasn't her fault. They start to argue sometimes for hours or even over a period 

### of days and eventually, rather than resolving the problem amicably, one parent wins out because the other ultimately 

### gives in, at least for the moment. Nevertheless, the parental power struggle often begins all over again at a later time 

### with a different issue, with some of the same anger from the previous conflict resurfacing. The wounds never fully 

### heal and the animosity builds. 

### Clearly, this is not a healthy situation. Parents need to learn the skills of conflict resolution. These include: 

### Listening 

### Clarifying points of difference 

### Taking each other's feelings seriously 

### Generating alternative solutions together 

### Negotiating 

### Remember, the way you handle conflict in your family is how your child learns to manage disagreement. Many 

### community colleges offer seminars and courses on conflict resolution. 

## The Impact of Marital Problems 

### Interpersonal relationships do not exist in a vacuum. If you and your spouse are having marital difficulties, they are 

### likely to disrupt the entire family. When your marriage is not going well (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/types

### of-families/pages/Divorce-What-Should-You-Tell-the-Children.aspx), your parenting skills and your children will 

### suffer. 

### The adults in the most successful families do not neglect marital problems. They commit themselves to spending 

### time together as a couple and working together to resolve any misunderstandings, jealousies or conflicts. They make 

### a commitment to communicate, praise, and forgive each other; they try to understand each other; and they routinely 

### examine their relationship and how it can be improved. 

### Sometimes children are a convenient excuse for not dealing with serious marital difficulties. Parents may think, "The 

### kids require so much of our attention now; once they're grown, we'll have a lot of time to talk about the problems we 

### have in our own relationship." But that is a prescription for marital and parenting disaster. Problems tend only to 

### become worse with time, and once your children are grown, you may not have much of a foundation to build on if 

### you are still together at all. So don't be complacent and let problems persist without attempting to solve them.
