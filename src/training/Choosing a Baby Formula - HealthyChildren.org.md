# Choosing a Baby Formula 

## To maintain safety standards, U.S. law and the Food and 

## Drug Administration (FDA) govern the contents and 

## safe production and distribution of all infant formulas. 

## When shopping for infant formula, you'll find several 

## basic types. 

## Cow's milk–based baby formulas 

## Cow's milk–based formulas account for about 80% of 

## the formula sold. Although cow's milk is the basis for 

## such formulas, the milk has been changed dramatically 

## to make it safe for infants. It is treated by heating and 

## other methods to make the protein more digestible. More milk sugar (lactose) is added to make the concentration 

## equal to that found in breast milk, and the butterfat is removed and replaced with vegetable oils and other fats that 

## infants can more easily digest and are better for infant growth. 

## Iron-fortified baby formula 

## Cow's milk-based baby formulas have additional iron added. These iron-fortified formulas have dramatically reduced 

## the rate of iron-deficiency anemia (/English/health-issues/conditions/chronic/Pages/Anemia-and-Your-Child.aspx) 

## in infancy in recent decades. 

## Some infants do not have enough natural reserves of iron, a mineral necessary for normal human growth and 

## development. For that reason, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) currently recommends that iron

## fortified formula be used for all infants who are not breastfed, or who are only partially breastfed, from birth to 

## one year of age. 

## Additional iron is available in many foods (including baby food), especially in meats, egg yolks, and iron-fortified 

## cereals. Low-iron formulas should not be used. Some mothers worry about iron causing constipation 

## (/English/health-issues/conditions/abdominal/Pages/constipation.aspx), but the amount of iron in infant formula 

## does not contribute to constipation. Most formulas also have docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (ARA) 

## added to them, fatty acids, believed to be important for the development of a baby's brain and eyes. 

## Probiotics 

## Some formulas also are fortified with probiotics (/English/ages-stages/baby/formula-feeding/Pages/Probiotics-in

## Infant-Formula.aspx), which are types of "friendly" bacteria. Others are now fortified with prebiotics, in the form of 

## manufactured oligosaccharides, in an attempt to mimic the natural human milk oligosaccharides, which are 

## substances that promote healthy intestinal lining. 

## Extensively hydrolyzed baby formula 

## Another type of formula is extensively hydrolyzed formula, which often is called "predigested," since the protein 

## content has already been broken down into smaller proteins that can be digested more easily. Ask your pediatrician to 

## recommend a brand of hypoallergenic formula if one is needed for allergies or other conditions. However, these 

## extensively hydrolyzed formulas tend to be costlier than regular formulas. 

## Soy formulas for babies 

## Soy formulas contain a protein (soy) and carbohydrate (either glucose or sucrose) different from milk-based 

## formulas. They are sometimes recommended for babies unable to digest lactose (/English/healthy

## living/nutrition/Pages/Lactose-Intolerance-in-Children.aspx), the main carbohydrate in cow's milk formula, although 

## simple lactose-free cow milk–based formula is also available.

### Lactose intolerance 

#### Many infants have brief periods when they cannot digest lactose, particularly following bouts of diarrhea, which can 

#### damage the digestive enzymes in the lining of the intestines. But this is usually only a temporary problem and does 

#### not require a change in your baby's diet. It is extremely rare for babies to have a significant problem digesting and 

#### absorbing lactose (although it tends to occur in older children and adults). While lactose-free formulas are fine 

#### sources of nutrition, check with your pediatrician before starting your baby on a lactose-free formula, since whatever 

#### problem they may be having is likely due to something else. 

### Milk allergy 

#### With a true milk allergy (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Milk-Allergy.aspx) causing colic, failure to thrive, 

#### and even bloody diarrhea, the allergy is to the protein in the cow's milk formula. In this case soy formulas may seem 

#### like a good alternative. However, up to half the infants who have milk allergy are also sensitive to soy protein, and thus 

#### must be given specialized formula (such as amino-based or elemental) or breast milk. 

### Vegetarian & vegan concerns 

#### Some strict vegetarian (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Information-for-Vegetarians.aspx) and vegan 

#### parents choose to use soy formula because it contains no animal products. Remember that breastfeeding 

#### (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Where-We-Stand-Breastfeeding.aspx) is the best option for 

#### vegetarian families. And while some parents believe a soy formula might prevent or ease the symptoms of colic or 

#### fussiness, there is no evidence to support this. 

### Galactosemia 

#### The AAP believes that there are few circumstances in which soy formula should be chosen instead of cow's milk– 

#### based formula. However, one of these situations is in infants with a rare disorder called galactosemia; children with 

#### this condition have an intolerance to galactose, one of the two sugars in lactose. These babies cannot tolerate breast 

#### milk and must be fed a lactose-free formula. All states include a test for galactosemia in routine newborn screening 

#### (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Newborn-Screening-Tests.aspx) after birth. 

## Specialized baby formulas 

#### There are specialized formulas for infants with specific disorders or diseases, including for premature babies. If your 

#### pediatrician recommends a specialized formula for your infant, follow their guidance about feeding requirements 

#### (amounts, scheduling, special preparations), since these may be quite different from regular formulas.
