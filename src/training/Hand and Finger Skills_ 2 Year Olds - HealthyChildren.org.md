# Hand and Finger Skills: 2 Year Olds 

## At age two, your child will be able to manipulate small objects with ease. He’ll turn the pages of a 

## book, build a tower six blocks high, pull off his shoes, and unzip a large zipper. He’ll also 

## coordinate the movements of his wrist, fingers, and palm so well that he can turn a doorknob, 

## unscrew a jar lid, use a cup with one hand, and unwrap paper from a candy. 

## One of his major accomplishments this year will be learning to “draw.” Hand him a crayon and 

## watch what happens: He’ll place his thumb on one side of it and his fingers on the other, then 

## awkwardly try to extend his index or middle finger toward the point. Clumsy as this grip may 

## seem, it will give him enough control to create his first artistic masterpieces, using sweeping 

## vertical and circular strokes. 

## Fortunately, your child’s quiet play at this age will be much more focused than it was at eighteen months, when he was 

## into everything. His attention span is longer, and now that he can turn pages, he’ll be an active participant as you look 

## at books or magazines together. He’ll also be interested in activities such as drawing, building, or manipulating 

## objects, so blocks and interlocking construction sets may keep him entertained for long periods. And if you let him 

## loose with a box of crayons or a set of fingerpaints, his creative impulses will flourish.
