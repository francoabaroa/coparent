# Preparing Your Child for Child Care 

## Most infants, up to 7 months of age, adjust well to good child care. Older infants may get upset 

## when left with strangers. They will need extra time and your support to get to know the caregiver 

## and to understand that you will pick them up at the end of the day. Starting new child care is often 

## harder on the parents than it is on the child. 

## Being prepared makes any new experience easier. You can help your child adjust to a new child 

## care arrangement. Try the following: 

## Arrange a visit with in-home caregivers while you are at home or when you need child care 

## for a short time. 

## Visit the center or home with your child before beginning care. Show your child that you like and trust the 

## caregiver. 

## Check with the caregiver or center staff about the best time of the month or year for children to begin attending 

## the program. 

## Allow your child to carry a reminder of home to child care. A family photograph or small toy can be helpful. 

## Talk with your child about child care and the caregiver. 

## Read books about child care. (Check with your local library.) 

## Sudden changes in caregivers may be upsetting to a child. This can happen even if the new caregiver is kind and 

## competent. You may want to arrange a meeting with the new caregiver or ask your child's doctor for advice. Parents 

## need to help caregivers and the child deal with any changes in the child's routine at home or child care.
