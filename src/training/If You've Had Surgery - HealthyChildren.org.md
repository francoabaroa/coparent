# If You've Had Surgery 

## I have just learned that I must have surgery a week from 

## now. I’m afraid that breastfeeding will be too difficult 

## during my recovery, and I’m thinking about weaning 

## over the next seven days. Can I wean my baby in such a 

## short time? 

## Few types of surgery require a woman to stop breastfeeding entirely. In cases that require a temporary interruption in 

## breastfeeding, consider expressing breastmilk before the surgery and freezing it for your baby’s use until you can 

## resume nursing. 

## Abrupt weaning should be attempted only when no alternative presents itself. Apply cabbage leaves to your breasts to 

## ease your discomfort. Your child may resist the accelerated pace, but you will at least have introduced her to 

## alternative feeding possibilities before you wean completely. 

## Be sure to make time for a great deal of cuddling, playing, and other non-nursing-related contact to cushion any 

## feelings of confusion your child may experience. Meanwhile, keep in mind your own need to adjust to this sudden 

## change by easing breast engorgement and making allowances for hormonal and emotional fluctuations.
