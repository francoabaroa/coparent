# A "Perfect" Parent 

## Is there such a thing as a "perfect" parent? 

## Many people believe in the myth of the perfect parents the ideal mother and father who raise happy, well-adjusted 

## problem-free children. In truth, there is no such person as a perfect parent or a perfect child. 

## Problem behavior is common among school-age children and takes up a significant portion of a parent's time. At any 

## one time, on average, school-age children have about five or six traits or behaviors that their parents find difficult. 

## These might include not complying with simple requests, avoiding chores, spending too much time watching TV or 

## playing videos, engaging in sibling rivalry or having difficulty completing homework. Other common problems for 

## parents are dealing with a temperamentally difficult child, or coping with a child who either wants too much 

## independence or hasn't achieved enough autonomy. Parents also sometimes encounter the dilemma of a child who 

## prefers friends or activities not approved of by his mother or father. 

## Mistakes are OK 

## As a parent, you need to recognize that it is normal to feel worried, confused, angry, guilty, overwhelmed and 

## inadequate because of your child's behavior. That is part of being a parent. It is futile and self-defeating to try to be 

## perfect or to raise perfect children. 

## Think back to how you behaved, or misbehaved, as a child, about how your parents dealt with your behavior, and how 

## you felt about their disciplinary techniques. They were not perfect, but neither was anyone else. Do not try to 

## overcompensate for their shortcomings by trying to be perfect yourself, and by getting caught up in statements like 

## "I'm not going to make the same mistakes my parents made." 

## All parents and all children make mistakes in their attempts to communicate and deal with one another and in trying 

## to solve problems. Parents need to trust themselves and their instincts. Mothers and fathers tend to have good 

## intuition and knowledge of their own children. They often know more than they think they do, and they should not be 

## afraid of making mistakes. Children are resilient and forgiving and usually learn and grow through their mistakes. 

## Parents tend to be just as resilient and forgiving. 

## Flexible Parenting 

## However, parents who "live for their children" are putting themselves in a very vulnerable position, setting themselves 

## up for possible disappointment, frustration and resentment. They are also being unfair to their family. Parents should 

## not expect to receive all their personal fulfillment from their children or from the parenting role. Parents need other 

## activities to fulfill their self-images, and other sources of love and nurturing. They need time to be adults and time for 

## themselves and a break from children and parenting responsibilities. 

## As a parent, you need to develop your own philosophy one with which you feel comfortable within a flexible and 

## adaptable framework. Take into account your own expectations, parenting style, and temperament, and how they fit 

## with each of your children and your spouse, and their own unique preferences and temperaments. Your approach and 

## philosophy will vary from youngster to youngster, mainly because of their own particular attributes. 

## Along the way, remember that professional help is available if problems ever become too intense, exceed your own 

## coping capabilities, or cause secondary difficulties such as a decline in school performance, increased family stress or 

## serious emotional problems. 

## You should take comfort in the fact that in the vast majority of cases, children do turn out well. But along the way, keep 

## your sense of humor, trust your instincts and seek help and advice early rather than late. While parenting is a great 

## challenge, it can also be one of the most rewarding and enjoyable experiences of your life.

## Points To Keep In Mind 

### 1. Even among children of the same age, there is a range of what is normal in the way they develop socially, 

### emotionally, intellectually and physically. 

### 2. A child's maturity level may be different for the various qualities he is developing, including social skills, athletic 

### abilities and learning capabilities. He might be strong in math but weak in writing (or vice versa), or good at 

### basketball but not at golf. 

### 3. The variations described above may be permanent, forming a child's own unique profile; or they could be 

### evolving and thus be subject to change. 

### 4. The way a child develops can influence his behavior, and vice versa. 

### 5. The particular parenting style of a mother and father, as well as the child's environment, will affect the 

### youngster's behavior and development.
