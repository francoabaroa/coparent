## breastfeeding for about the first six months. We 

## support continued breastfeeding after solid foods 

## (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding

## nutrition/Pages/Starting-Solid-Foods.aspx) are 

## introduced as long as you and your baby desire, for 2 

## years or beyond. 

## Our breastfeeding recommendations, updated in the AAP's "Breastfeeding and the Use of Human Milk" policy 

## statement and technical report, now more closely align with guidance from the World Health Organization 

## (https://www.who.int/health-topics/breastfeeding#tab=tab_1). The United States has set ambitious goals 

## (https://health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/browse-objectives/infants) to increase the number of babies 

## receiving only breastmilk up to 6 months of age, with continued breastfeeding as part of the diet after that. 

## AAP's breastfeeding recommendations 

## The AAP recommends that babies consume only breast milk for about the first 6 months. There is no need to 

## give your baby infant formula or other sources of nutrition. 

## Beyond 6 months, we recommend continued breastfeeding along with other nutritious foods. Your baby does not 

## need any infant or toddler formula. 

## Why AAP recommends breastfeeding 

## There are so many benefits to breastfeeding! Breastfeeding improves the health of nursing parents and their babies. 

## Breastfeeding can reduce risks for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/A

## Parents-Guide-to-Safe-Sleep.aspx)) by up to 64% and overall infant death risks by as much as 40%. 

## Breastfeeding can also help protect your baby against lower respiratory tract infections and severe or persistent 

## diarrhea, asthma, eczema, Crohn's and ulcerative colitis, obesity, type 1 and 2 diabetes, leukemia, tooth decay and other 

## problems that can require orthodontia later. Studies also link breastfeeding with higher IQ scores. 

## Nutrition during your baby's first 1,000 days (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Babys-First-1000-Days-AAP-Policy

## Explained.aspx) is so important—and breastmilk is perfectly formulated for your baby's brain development and long

## term health. 

## There are continued benefits from breastfeeding beyond 1 year, and up to 2 years especially for the breastfeeding 

## parent's health. This includes protection against diabetes, high blood pressure, and cancers of the breast and ovaries. 

## Other benefits of breastfeeding: 

## Breastfeeding provides warmth and closeness between parent and child. This physical contact helps create 

## special bonds between you and your baby. 

## Breast milk is easy for your baby to digest. 

## Breast milk doesn't need to be prepared. It is already ready and free! 

## Breast milk has all the nutrients, calories and fluids your baby needs! 


### Breastfeeding can also release hormones that promote healthy parenting behavior. 

### Breastfeeding can help return your uterus to its pre-pregnancy size more quickly. 

### It can also provide contraception if you meet these 3 conditions: 

### 1. You are exclusively breastfeeding at day and nighttime and not giving your baby any supplements; 

### 2. It is within six months of birth, and 

### 3. Your period has not returned. 

## How can I raise my chances of breastfeeding success? 

### Before leaving the hospital or birthing center, ask for help to make sure your baby is latching on and getting milk 

### during breastfeeding. The amount of milk a baby will get during each breastfeeding attempt is small during the first 

### day (about 1 teaspoon) and increases on the second and third days. 

### We support hospitals and health care centers as resources to help breastfeeding parents get off to a good start. 

### Breastfeeding is most successful when started during the first hour after birth, along with skin-to-skin contact 

### (/English/ages-stages/baby/preemie/Pages/About-Skin-to-Skin-Care.aspx), lactation counseling and frequent 

### breastfeeding during the early days. Skilled lactation support in maternity care facilities can be a huge support to 

### breastfeeding parents. 

## What should breastfeeding parents know as they get started? 

### Remember that it is normal for breastfeeding babies to lose some weight in the first days. Your pediatrician will assess 

### if there is a problem with excessive weight loss. Do not worry—breast milk is all your baby needs the first six months 

### of life. The size of your breasts has nothing to do with the amount of milk they will produce. 

### Also keep in mind that nipple pain is common and needs to be assessed by your pediatrician. Often simple techniques 

### to address position and latch can help resolve your pain. 

### Newborns should nurse whenever they show signs of hunger (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding

### nutrition/Pages/How-Often-and-How-Much-Should-Your-Baby-Eat.aspx)—approximately 8 to 12 times every 24 

### hours. Every parent and baby is different, so the amount of time you nurse and how frequently you nurse will be 

### different as well. 

## Who should not breastfeed? 

### Babies with a condition called galactosemia (https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/galactosemia/) should not 

### breastfeed. Your pediatrician will let you know if this is an issue. 

### Parents with HIV (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Serious-Illnesses-and-Breastfeeding.aspx) who live 

### in the United States should not breastfeed due to the risk of passing this infection to their child. Your healthcare 

### provider will let you know any other conditions that may be problematic with breastfeeding. 

## What are some challenges I may face in reaching my breastfeeding 

## goals? 

### Societal pressures can get in the way of breastfeeding goals. For example, a lack of universal paid maternity leave to 

### establish breastfeeding can be a challenge. Parents may lack adequate workplace support to pump. Ask your 

### pediatrician about ways they can support you at your workplace. They may be able to help you identify 

### accommodations as well as identify insurance coverage for breast pumps and supplies. 

### Many parents face stigma when they choose to breastfeed, especially if they nurse in public or choose to breastfeed 

### older children. However, breastfeeding is a human right. Pediatricians and families can work together to make sure 

### this right is protected. 

### If you choose to breastfeed beyond the first year, seek out support from your community and health care provider. 

### Some families will choose not to breastfeed, to breastfeed for shorter durations, or combine breastfeeding with the 

### use of infant formula. Your pediatrician can guide you on how best to safely meet your goals and the nutritional needs 

### of your baby. No two mothers share the same goals in breastfeeding. But every parent deserves nonjudgmental 

### support and help in feeding their infant.
