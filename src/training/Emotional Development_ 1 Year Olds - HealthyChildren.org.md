# Emotional Development: 1 Year Olds 

## Throughout her second year, your child will swing back and forth constantly between fierce 

## independence and clinging to you. Now that she can walk and do things for herself physically, she 

## has the power to move away from you and test her new skills. But at the same time, she’s not yet 

## entirely comfortable with the idea that she’s an individual, separate from you and everyone else 

## in the world. Especially when she’s tired, sick, or scared, she’ll want you there to comfort her and 

## fend off loneliness. 

## It’s impossible to predict when she’ll turn her back on you and when she’ll come running for 

## shelter. She may seem to change from one moment to the next, or she may seem mature and 

## independent for several whole days before suddenly regressing. You may feel mixed reactions to this, as well: While 

## there are moments when it feels wonderful to have your baby back, there are bound to be other times when her 

## fussing and whining is the last thing you need. Some people call this period the first adolescence. It reflects some of 

## your child’s mixed feelings about growing up and leaving you, and it’s absolutely normal. Remember that the best way 

## to help her regain her composure is to give her attention and reassurance when she needs it. Snapping at her to “act 

## like a big girl” will only make her feel and act more insecure and needy. 

## Brief separations from you may help your toddler become more independent. She’ll still suffer some separation 

## anxiety and perhaps put up a fuss when you leave her—even if it’s just for a few minutes. But the protest will be brief. 

## Chances are, you may be more upset by these separations than she is, but try not to let her know that. If she believes 

## her fussing has a chance of getting you to stay, she’ll continue to fuss with similar occasions in the future. As tempting 

## as it might be to quietly “sneak” away, she might actually become more clingy because she then never knows when 

## you’re going to disappear next. Instead, leave her with a kiss and a promise to return. And when you do come back, 

## greet her enthusiastically and devote your full attention to her for a while before moving on to other chores or 

## business. When your child understands that you always return and continue to love her, she’ll feel more secure.
