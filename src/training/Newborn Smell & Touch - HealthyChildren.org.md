# Newborn Smell & Touch 

## Just as babies prefer certain patterns and sounds, they are typically very particular about tastes 

## and smells. They will breathe deeply to catch a whiff of milk, vanilla, banana, or sugar, but will turn 

## up their nose at the smell of alcohol or vinegar. 

## By the end of their first week, if they’re nursing, they’ll turn toward their mother’s breast pad but 

## will ignore the pads of other nursing mothers. This radar-like system helps direct them at feeding 

## times and warn them away from substances that could harm them. 

## Babies are equally sensitive to touch and the way you handle them. They’ll nestle into a soft piece 

## of flannel or satin, but pull away from scratchy burlap or coarse sandpaper. When they are stroked gently with a palm, 

## they’ll relax and become quiet. If they’re picked up roughly, they’ll probably take offense and start to cry. If they’re 

## picked up gently and rocked slowly, they’ll become quiet and attentive. 

## Holding, stroking, rocking, and cuddling will calm them when they’re upset and make them more alert when they’re 

## drowsy. It also sends a clear message of a parent’s love and affection. Long before they understand a word that parents 

## say, they’ll understand parental moods and feelings from the way they are touched.
