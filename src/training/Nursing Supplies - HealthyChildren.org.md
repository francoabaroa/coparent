# Nursing Supplies 

## Throughout most of human history, mothers have successfully breastfed their babies without the 

## help of nursing pillows, breast pads, or even rocking chairs. Our bodies, and our children’s bodies, 

## are well designed to make nursing a simple and rewarding process. Still, some supplies can make 

## life as a nursing mother easier, if they fit into your budget. (Nursing equipment also makes 

## wonderful baby gifts.) 

## Nursing Bras 

## A well-made nursing bra that comfortably supports your enlarged breasts can be useful. It is 

## difficult to predict what size nursing bra you will need, but take your best guess and purchase at least one or two while 

## pregnant to have for the hospital. After childbirth you can be fitted for one, which should never be tight or 

## constricting. 

## Nursing bras have front flaps that can be detached with one hand (while the other is supporting the baby) and pulled 

## open for nursing. Outer clothing designed for nursing provides openings for the baby to access the breast and is a 

## practical idea for mothers concerned about nursing discreetly in public. 

## Both nursing bras and clothing are available at maternity shops, in mother-child clothing catalogs, and at many 

## department stores. Of course, shirts that can easily be lifted up and blouses that unbutton from the bottom up also 

## work quite well. 

## Breast Pads 

## Disposable or washable breast pads, which can be slipped inside the bra cup to absorb any milk that leaks out between 

## feedings, are useful for women whose breasts leak a great deal or who sometimes find themselves away from their 

## babies at a regular feeding time. Avoid pads with plastic liners that impede the flow of air around the nipples and hold 

## the moisture in, which can irritate the nipples. Breast pads can be purchased at most pharmacies and grocery stores— 

## though a folded piece of absorbent cloth works almost as well. 

## Positioners and Other Equipment 

## While not necessary for successful breastfeeding, equipment to help you hold, cuddle, and soothe your baby can be a 

## welcome addition to a nursery. Some mothers find that a custom-made nursing pillow, designed to help you position 

## your baby properly and hold her for an entire feeding without tiring your arms, is easier than trying to arrange 

## ordinary pillows or cushions. (Nursing pillows come in various shapes and sizes, so you may want to try out several 

## before choosing one that suits you.) 

## A footstool raises the level of your lap, bringing your baby closer to your breast. It also helps keep your back straight, 

## which may make you more comfortable. Some new mothers enjoy a rocking chair or glider to use in the baby’s room 

## in anticipation of those precious moments when a nursing session blends into sleep. 

## Other pieces of optional equipment include a baby sling or carrier that frees your hands while keeping your baby 

## close enough to nurse, and a bassinet for keeping your sleeping infant beside your bed. You can find these items in 

## most baby supply stores and baby equipment catalogs. 

## Please remember, however, that special equipment and furnishings are all extras. All you really need to nurse 

## successfully are your breasts and a hungry baby.
