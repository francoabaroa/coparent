# Preemie Sleep Patterns 

## Don’t expect your preterm baby (/english/ages-stages/baby/preemie/Pages/default.aspx) to sleep 

## through the night for many months. Unlike a term baby, who might sleep a full 6 to 8 hours at 

## night by 4 months of age, your baby may not accomplish this task until 6 to 8 months or 

## later. 

## During this transition period, play with your baby during daytime awake periods. Keep night 

## feedings as quiet and as businesslike as possible, with minimal or soft lighting. This will help your 

## baby learn the difference between day and night and may help you get much-needed sleep at 

## appropriate hours. But remember, it may take several weeks before your baby gets her days and 

## nights straight! 

## Following a Routine 

## Babies vary in how easily they settle down to sleep. Follow the same steps each time you put your baby down to sleep 

## to help her learn a personal going-to-sleep routine. At first, you’ll probably jump up and go to your baby at the first 

## crying sound. But as you get to know each other and as you notice your baby’s self-comforting skills, you need to allow 

## your baby to console herself and go back to sleep on her own. 

## Self-Comforting 

## Self-comforting is an important skill for your baby. Beginning early to teach your baby to fall asleep on her own will 

## ease you through the later developmental stage (at 6–9 months corrected age (/English/ages

## stages/baby/preemie/pages/Corrected-Age-For-Preemies.aspx)) when sleep problems may emerge once again. 

## Setting the Mood for Sleep 

## To help your baby rest, try playing the radio softly or placing a ticking clock in the room for those first few weeks at 

## home. In addition, a soft night-light may be reassuring to you both. Let your baby suck on her fist or a pacifier 

## (/English/ages-stages/baby/crying-colic/Pages/Practical-Pacifier-Principles.aspx) if this seems calming.
