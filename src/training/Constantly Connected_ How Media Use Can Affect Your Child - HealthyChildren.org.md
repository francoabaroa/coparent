# Constantly Connected: How Media Use Can Affect Your 

# Child 

## Today's children and teens are growing up immersed in 

## digital media. It ranges from TV and videos to social 

## media, video games and so much more. And it's all 

## available on multiple devices—computers, e-readers, 

## gaming consoles, smartphones and other screens. 

## Kids & media use: by the numbers 

## Recent Common Sense Media (https://www.commonsensemedia.org/research/the-common-sense-census-media

## use-by-tweens-and-teens-2021) research shows that media use by tweens (ages 8–12 years) and teens (ages 13–18 

## years) has risen faster in the two years since the pandemic than the four years before. The research found 8to 12

## year-olds spend an average of five and a half hours a day on screens and consuming media. That rate climbs to over 

## eight and a half hours a day for teens. 

## Among teens, 79% said they use social media and online videos at least once a week, and 32% of these said they 

## "wouldn't want to live without" YouTube. And nearly two-thirds (65%) of tweens said they watch TV, 64% watch online 

## videos and 43% play games on a smartphone or tablet every day. 

## Average daily screentime rates soared highest among Black and Hispanic/Latino kids and those of lower-income 

## families. These teens and tweens were spending between 6.5 and 7.5 hours a day on entertainment screens. 

## In another survey (https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2020/07/28/parenting-children-in-the-age-of-screens/), 

## 71% of parents with younger children (under 12 years old) said they were concerned about their child spending too 

## much time in front of screens. 

## Risks & benefits of media use by children & teens 

## Why use digital media? 

## Digital media use can: 

## Expose users to new ideas and information. 

## Raise awareness of current events and issues. 

## Promote community participation. 

## Help students work with others on assignments and projects. 

## Digital media use also has social benefits that: 

## Allow families and friends to stay in touch, no matter where they live. 

## Enhance access to valuable support networks, especially for people with illnesses or disabilities. 

## Media can influence how children and teens feel, 

## learn, think and behave. This is why it's important to 

## be understand the risks & benefits of digital media 

## use and how to keep them in balance for your family. 


#### Help promote wellness and healthy behaviors, such as how to quit smoking or how to eat healthy. 

### Why limit media use? 

#### Overuse of digital media may place your children at risk of: 

#### Not enough sleep. Media use can interfere with sleep. Children and teens who have too much media exposure 

#### or who have a TV, computer, or mobile device in their bedroom fall asleep later at night and sleep less. Even 

#### babies can be overstimulated by screens and miss the sleep they need to grow. Exposure to light (particularly 

#### blue light) and stimulating content from screens can delay or disrupt sleep and have a negative effect on school. 

#### Obesity. Excessive screen use and having a TV in the bedroom can increase the risk of obesity. Watching TV for 

#### more than 1.5 hours daily is a risk factor for obesity for children 4 through 9 years of age. Teens who watch more 

#### than 5 hours of TV per day are 5 times more likely to have over-weight than teens who watch 0 to 2 hours. Food 

#### advertising and snacking while watching TV can promote obesity. Also, children who overuse media are less apt 

#### to be active with healthy, physical play. 

#### Delays in learning & social skills. When infants or preschoolers watch too much TV, they may show delays in 

#### attention, thinking, language and social skills. One reason for this could be that they don't interact as much with 

#### their parents and family members. Parents who keep the TV on or spend excess time on their own digital media 

#### miss precious opportunities to interact with their children and help them learn. 

#### Negative effect on school performance. Children and teens often use entertainment media at the same time 

#### that they're doing other things, such as homework (/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/school/Pages/Developing

#### Good-Homework-Habits.aspx). Such multitasking can have a negative effect on how well they do in school. 

#### Behavior problems. Violent content on TV and screens can contribute to behavior problems in children, either 

#### because they are scared and confused by what they see or they try to mimic on-screen characters. 

#### Problematic internet use. Children who spend too much time using online media can be at risk for a type of 

#### additive behavior called problematic internet use. Heavy video gamers are at risk for Internet gaming disorder. 

#### They spend most of their free time online and show less interest in offline or real-life relationships. There may 

#### be increased risks for depression at both the high and low ends of Internet use. 

#### Risky behaviors. Teens' displays on social media often show risky behaviors, such as substance use, sexual 

#### behaviors, self-injury, or eating disorders. Exposure of teens through media to alcohol, tobacco use, or sexual 

#### behaviors is linked to engaging in these behaviors earlier. 

#### Sexting, loss of privacy & predators. Sexting (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/The-New-Problem-of

#### Sexting.aspx) is the sending or receiving of sexually explicit images, videos, or text messages using a smartphone, 

#### computer, tablet, video game or digital camera. About 19% of youth have sent a sexual photo to someone else. 

#### Teens need to know that once content is shared with others, they may not be able to delete it completely. Kids 

#### may also not use privacy settings. Sex offenders may use social networking, chat rooms, e-mail and online games 

#### to contact and exploit children. 

#### Cyberbullying. Children and teens online can be victims of cyberbullying. Cyberbullying can lead to shortand 

#### long-term negative social, academic, and health issues for both the bully and target. Fortunately, programs to 

#### help prevent bullying may reduce cyberbullying.

## Make a family media use plan 

#### Children today are growing up in a time of highly personalized media use experiences. It's smart to develop a 

#### customized media use plan for your children. This helps your kids avoid overusing media by balancing it with other 

#### healthy activities. 

#### A media plan should consider each child's age, health, personality and developmental stage. Remember, all children 

#### and teens need adequate sleep (8–12 hours each night, depending on age), physical activity (1 hour a day) and time 

#### away from media. Create a customized plan for your family with our interactive Family Media Use Plan 

#### (/mediauseplan). Developed by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), this tool works with your family's values 

#### and busy life.
