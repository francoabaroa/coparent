# Tips to Reduce Arsenic in Your Baby’s Diet 

## Yes, arsenic. It occurs naturally in our environment in both organic 

## (typically non-toxic) and inorganic forms. Inorganic arsenic is toxic 

## and carcinogenic (cancer-causing). The biggest health risks from 

## exposure (/English/safety-prevention/all-around/Pages/Arsenic

## Health-Effects-and-Exposure.aspx) to inorganic arsenic occur 

## during pregnancy, infancy, and early childhood. 

## FDA Proposes Limit for Inorganic 

## Arsenic in Infant Rice Cereal 

## In April 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released 

## a proposal (http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/UCM493740.htm) to limit inorganic 

## arsenic in infant rice cereal. The FDA's announcement was based on its assessment of a large body of scientific 

## information. However, the FDA is not recommending specific limits on how much rice or rice products we should eat. 

## Rather, the FDA is continuing to recommend that all consumers, including infants, children, and pregnant women, 

## should eat a variety of foods, including a variety of grains. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) supports the 

## proposed action level and offers tips for parents on the issue. 

## How You Can Reduce Your Baby's Arsenic Exposure: 

## Breastfeed. The AAP recommends breastfeeding (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Working

## Together-Breastfeeding-and-Solid-Foods.aspx) as the sole source of nutrition for your baby for about 6 months. 

## When you add solid foods to your baby's diet, continue breastfeeding until at least 12 months. You can continue 

## to breastfeed after 12 months if you and your baby desire. Check with your child's doctor about vitamin D 

## (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Vitamin-D-And-Your-Baby.aspx) and iron supplements (/English/ages

## stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Vitamin-Iron-Supplements.aspx) during the first year. 

## Vary your baby's diet. Rice cereal fortified with iron is a good source of nutrients, but it shouldn't be the only 

## source, and does not need to be the first source. Other options for parents to introduce as first foods besides rice 

## cereal include oat, barley, and multigrain cereals. When introducing any new foods, the AAP recommends doing 

## so slowly and watching for any reactions. 

## Limit fruit juices. In 2012, similar questions were raised about arsenic in juice products. For years, the AAP has 

## recommended limited intake of all sweet beverages, including juice 

## (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Where-We-Stand-Fruit-Juice.aspx). 

## Infants can be encouraged to eat whole fruits that are mashed or pureed. Toddlers and young children can be 

## encouraged to eat whole fruits instead of juice. 

## Avoid brown rice syrup as a sweetener in processed foods for kids. The arsenic in rice is concentrated in rice 

## syrup, which is sometimes used as a sweetener in toddler snacks (/English/ages

## stages/toddler/nutrition/Pages/Selecting-Snacks-for-Toddlers.aspx) or puffs. 

## Do not use rice milk as a dairy substitute for cow's milk. In many cases, dairy-sensitive children can be given 

## other dietary sources of calcium instead of a highly processed dairy substitute. 

## Talk with your pediatrician 

## If you're concerned about arsenic in your child's food, talk with your pediatrician. Your regional Pediatric 

## Environmental Health Specialty Unit (PEHSU (https://www.pehsu.net/)) have staff who can also talk with parents 

## about concerns over environmental toxins.
