# Make Baby's Room Safe: Parent Checklist 

## Every home is different, and no checklist is complete and 

## appropriate for every household, however use this checklist to help 

## ensure that the bedrooms in your home are safer for your child. 

## Changing Table 

## Although a changing table makes it easier to dress and diaper your 

## baby, falls from such a high surface can be serious. Don't trust your 

## vigilance alone to prevent falls; you should also consider the 

## following recommendations. 

## Choose a sturdy, stable changing table with a 2-inch (5-cm) 

## guardrail around all four sides. 

## The top of the changing table pad should be concave, so that the middle is slightly lower than the sides. 

## Buckle the safety strap, but don't depend on it alone to keep your child secure. Always keep a hand on your baby. 

## Never leave a child unattended on a dressing table, even for a moment, even if he is strapped. 

## Keep diapering supplies within your reach—but out of your child's reach—so you don't have to leave your baby's 

## side to get them. Never let him play with a powder container. If he opens and shakes it, he's likely to inhale 

## particles of powder, which can injure his lungs. 

## If you use disposable diapers, store them out of your child's reach and cover them with clothing when he wears 

## them. Children can suffocate if they tear off pieces of the plastic liner and swallow them. 

## Suffocation Prevention 

## Do not use baby or talcum powders on the baby. If inhaled, talcum-containing powders can cause severe lung 

## damage and breathing problems in babies. 

## Keep the crib free of all small objects (safety pins, small parts of toys, etc.) that she could swallow. 

## Never leave plastic bags or wrappings where your baby can reach them. 

## Don't have your baby sleep in your own bed next to you. Keep her in her crib. 

## Instead of using loose blankets that your baby could get tangled in, dress her in appropriate-weight sleepwear 

## (like a wearable blanket or sleep sack). 

## Don't allow your baby to sleep on her stomach, nor should she sleep on a soft comforter or pillow. Place her to 

## sleep only on her back. 

## Necklaces and Cords 

## Don't let strings or cords dangle in or anywhere near the crib. 

## Don't attach pacifiers, medallions, or other objects to the crib or body with a cord. 

## Don't place a string or necklace around the baby's neck. 

## Don't use clothing with drawstrings. 


## Cribs 

#### Your baby usually will be unattended when in his or her crib, so this should be a totally safe environment. Falls are the 

#### most common injury associated with cribs, even though they are the easiest to prevent. Children are most likely to fall 

#### out of the crib when the mattress is raised too high for their height, or not lowered properly as they grow. 

#### Use a crib manufactured after June 2011, when the current safety standards banning the manufacture or sale of drop

#### side rail cribs became effective. There is a good chance that an older crib no longer meets all the current safety 

#### standards, especially if it has a drop side. 

### No matter what the age of your crib, inspect it carefully for the following features: 

#### Slats should be no more than 2 / inches (6 cm) apart so a child's head cannot become trapped between them. 

#### Widely spaced slats can allow an infant's legs and body to fall through but will trap the infant's head, which can 

#### result in death. 

#### There should be no decorative cut-outs in the headboard or footboard, as your child's head or limbs could 

#### become trapped in them. 

#### If the crib has corner posts, they should be flush with the end panels, or they should be very, very tall (such as 

#### posts on a canopy bed). Clothing and ribbons can catch on tall corner posts and strangle an infant. 

#### All screws, bolts, nuts, plastic parts, and other hardware should be present and original equipment. Never 

#### substitute original parts with something from a hardware store; replacement parts must be obtained from the 

#### manufacturer. They must be tightly in place to prevent the crib from coming apart; a child's activity can cause 

#### the crib to collapse, trapping and suffocating her. 

#### Before each assembly and weekly thereafter, inspect the crib for damage to hardware, loose joints, missing parts, 

#### or sharp edges. Do not use a crib if any parts are missing or broken. 

### You can prevent other crib hazards by observing the following guidelines: 

#### The mattress should be the same size as the crib so there are no gaps to trap arms, body, or legs. If you can insert 

#### more than two fingers between the mattress and the sides or ends of the crib, the crib and mattress combination 

#### should not be used. 

#### If you purchase a new mattress, remove and destroy all plastic wrapping material that comes with it, because it 

#### can suffocate a child. 

#### Before your baby can sit, lower the mattress of the crib to the level where he cannot fall out either by leaning 

#### against the side or by pulling himself over it. Set the mattress at its lowest position before your child learns to 

#### stand. The most common falls occur when a baby tries to climb out, so move your child to another bed when he is 

#### 35 inches (89 cm) tall, or when the height of the side rail is less than three-quarters of his height (approximately 

#### nipple level). 

#### Periodically check the crib to be sure there are no rough edges or sharp points on the metal parts, and no 

#### splinters or cracks in the wood. 

#### Do not use bumper pads in cribs. There is no evidence that they prevent injuries, and there is a possible risk of 

#### suffocation, strangulation, or entrapment. Infant deaths in cribs have been associated with bumper pads. In 

#### addition, toddlers can use a bumper guard to help them climb and fall out. 

#### Pillows, quilts, comforters, sheepskins, stuffed animals, and other soft products should not be placed in a crib. 

#### Babies have suffocated on such items in the crib. 

#### If you hang a mobile over your child's crib, be sure it is securely attached to the side rails, wall or ceiling. Hang it 

#### high enough so your baby cannot reach it to pull it down. Be sure to remove it when he is able to get up on his 

#### hands and knees, or is 5 months old, whichever comes first. 

#### Crib gyms are not recommended, as infants and toddlers may injure themselves falling forward onto the gym or 

#### pulling the gym down on top of their body. 

#### To prevent the most serious of falls and to keep children from getting caught in cords from hanging window 

#### blinds or draperies and strangling, don't place a crib—or any other child's bed—near a window. The Consumer 

#### Product Safety Commission recommends using cordless window coverings if possible.

## Other Bedroom Items 

#### Keep night-lights away from drapes or bedding where they could start a fire. Buy only cool night-lights that do 

#### not get hot. 

#### Install smoke alarms outside every bedroom (or any area where someone sleeps), in furnace areas, and on every 

#### level of your home, including the basement. Buy alarms with long-life lithium batteries. Standard batteries 

#### should be changed every year. Test alarms every month to make sure they are working properly. 

#### Install CO detectors on each floor of your home. CO is a toxic gas that has no taste, no color, and no odor. It comes 

#### from appliances or heaters that burn gas, oil, wood, propane, or kerosene. 

#### Make sure window guards are secured to prevent a child from falling out the window. 

#### The best toy chest is a box or basket without a lid. However, if it has a lid, make sure it has safe hinges that hold 

#### the lid open and do not pinch. The chest should also have air holes just in case your child gets trapped inside. 

#### Use a cool-mist humidifier or vaporizer to avoid burns. Clean it according to manufacturer instructions to 

#### avoid bacteria and mold growth.
