# Heavy Metals in Baby Food 

## News about heavy metals found in baby food can leave 

## parents with a lot of questions. 

## Here's some information from the American Academy 

## of Pediatrics about the risk of toxic metal exposure to 

## children, and how to help minimize it. 

## Can heavy metals in baby food 

## harm my baby? 

## The low levels of heavy metals found in baby foods 

## likely are a relatively small part of a child's overall toxic 

## metal exposure risk. However, exposure from all sources should be minimized. Toxic metal exposure can be harmful 

## to the developing brain. It's been linked with problems with learning, cognition and behavior. But keep in mind that 

## many genetic, social, and environment factors influence healthy brain development, and toxic metal exposure is just 

## one of these factors. 

## How do heavy metals get into foods? 

## Metals are found naturally in the Earth's crust. They also are released into our environment as pollution and get into 

## the water and soil used to grow food. Metals can also get into food from food manufacturing and packaging. Some of 

## the most common metals that get into food, according to the U.S. Food & Drug Administration, include inorganic 

## arsenic (/English/safety-prevention/all-around/Pages/Arsenic-Health-Effects-and-Exposure.aspx), lead 

## (/English/safety-prevention/all-around/Pages/Lead-Screening-for-Children.aspx), cadmium 

## (https://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/Metals/ucm521427.htm) and mercury 

## (https://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/Metals/ucm2006760.htm). 

## How can I reduce my baby's exposure to toxic metals? 

## Stronger rules and regulations for testing and limiting (https://services.aap.org/en/news-room/news

## releases/aap/2021/aap-statement-on-fda-announcement-regarding-toxic-metals-in-baby-and-toddler-food/) the 

## amount of heavy metals in foods for babies and toddlers are most important. But there are several steps parents can 

## take now to reduce the risk that kids will be exposed to toxic metals in their diet, and from other sources: 

## Serve a variety of foods. Give your child a well-balanced diet that includes a variety of fruits, vegetables (wash in 

## cool water before preparing and serving), grains and lean protein. Eating a variety of healthy foods that are rich in 

## essential nutrients can lower the exposure to toxic metals and other contaminants found in some foods. 

## Read the labels. Multi-ingredient baby food blends may be a good option. Be aware that many have the same 

## first or second ingredient, though. Different flavor blends, like kale/pear and spinach/pumpkin, for example, may 

## actually both have sweet potatoes as their first ingredient. It's important to read the ingredients label to be sure 

## you are offering a true variety of foods. 

## Switch up your grains. Fortified infant cereals can be a good source of nutrition for babies, but rice cereal does 

## not need to be the first (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Starting-Solid-Foods.aspx)or only 

## cereal used. Rice tends to absorb more arsenic (/English/safety-prevention/all-around/Pages/Arsenic-Health

## Effects-and-Exposure.aspx) from groundwater than other crops. You can include a variety of grains in your baby's 

## diet, including oat, barley, couscous, quinoa, farro, and bulgur. Multi-grain infant cereals can be a good choice. Try 

## to avoid using rice milk and brown rice syrup, which is sometimes used as a sweetener in processed toddler 

## foods. 


### Tips for choosing & cooking rice for your children 

#### Keep in mind that, among different types of rice, brown rice tends to have the highest arsenic levels. White basmati 

#### and sushi rice tends to have lower levels. When making rice from scratch, rinse it first. Cook it in extra water and 

#### then drain off the excess when's it's done. 

#### Check your water. Heavy metals can get into tap water: for example, arsenic (/English/ages

#### stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/reduce-arsenic.aspx) can contaminate well water (/English/safety

#### prevention/all-around/Pages/Where-We-Stand-Testing-of-Well-Water.aspx), and older pipes may contain lead 

#### (/English/safety-prevention/all-around/Pages/Lead-Screening-for-Children.aspx). You can contact your local 

#### health department to have your water tested if this is a concern. 

#### Breastfeed if possible. Breastfeeding, rather than formula feeding, also can help reduce exposure to toxic 

#### metals. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends (/English/ages

#### stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Where-We-Stand-Breastfeeding.aspx) breastfeeding as the sole source of 

#### nutrition for your baby for about 6 months. 

#### Avoid fruit juice. Offer toddlers and young children sliced or pureed whole fruits rather than juice 

#### (/english/healthy-living/nutrition/pages/fruit-juice-and-your-childs-diet.aspx). Some fruit juices can contain 

#### concerning levels of heavy metals. Plus, juice is high in sugar and not as nutrient rich as whole fruit. Stick with 

#### breast milk or formula for babies under 6 months old, and water (/English/healthy

#### living/nutrition/Pages/Choose-Water-for-Healthy-Hydration.aspx) and milk after they reach age 1. 

#### Make healthy fish choices. Some types of fish can be high in a form of mercury called methylmercury, and 

#### other metals. Of most concern are large, predatory fish that eat other fish and live longer, such as shark, orange 

#### roughy, swordfish, and albacore/white tuna. Eating too much contaminated fish can harm a child's developing 

#### nervous system. But fish is also an excellent source of protein and other nutrients (/English/news/Pages/AAP

#### Says-US-Children-Not-Eating-Enough-Seafood.aspx) children need, and many are low in mercury. Look for better 

#### options (/English/safety-prevention/all-around/Pages/Protecting-Your-Children-From-Contaminated-Fish.aspx) 

#### like light tuna (solid or chunk), salmon, cod, whitefish, and pollock. 

#### Variety is important for homemade baby food, too. There are several benefits to making your own baby food 

#### (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Starting-Solid-Foods.aspx) fresh at home: it can be cost

#### effective, avoids potential contaminants from processing or packaging, and you can choose the ingredients. But 

#### keep in mind that offering a variety of foods is just as important when making your own baby food as when 

#### shopping for prepared baby foods. 

#### Address lead hazards in your home. There are other important ways to help reduce your baby's exposure to 

#### toxic metals. The most common source of lead exposure, for example, is from peeling or chipping paint from 

#### older homes. Soil, some cosmetics and spices, water, and certain occupations and hobbies can also be sources of 

#### exposure. Find more information about lead here (/English/safety-prevention/all-around/Pages/Lead

#### Screening-for-Children.aspx). 

#### Don't smoke or vape. Secondhand and thirdhand (/English/health-issues/conditions/tobacco/Pages/How

#### Parents-Can-Prevent-Exposure-Thirdhand-Smoke.aspx) smoke from both regular and e-cigarettes 

#### (/English/health-issues/conditions/tobacco/Pages/Facts-For-Parents-About-E-Cigarettes-Electronic-Nicotine

#### Delivery-Systems.aspx), may expose children to metals such as cadmium and lead. Vaping allows toxic metals 

#### from the vape coils to get into the air and be inhaled. Secondhand smoke also contains harmful chemicals that 

#### can increase the risk of cancer. 

## Is organic baby food better? 

#### Organic (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Differences-in-Organic-Natural-and-Health-Foods.aspx) baby foods 

#### may have lower levels of certain pesticides and other chemicals. Because heavy metals are found in the soil and can 

#### get into prepared foods from processing, however,organic foods often contain similar levels of heavy metals as non

#### organic foods. 

## Should my baby be tested for heavy metal exposure? 

#### Until more information about metals in baby foods becomes available, experts say there's no need to get children 

#### tested. Tests that look at a child's hair for toxic metal exposure also are not recommended, since this type of testing is 

#### scientifically unproven and often inaccurate.

## Talk with your pediatrician 

#### If you're concerned about heavy metals in baby food, talk with your pediatrician. Your regional Pediatric 

#### Environmental Health Specialty Unit (PEHSU (http://www.pehsu.net/)) have staff who can also talk with parents about 

#### concerns over environmental toxins.
