# Checkup Checklist: First Birthday (12 Months Old) 

Happy first birthday to your baby! That little bundle you first held is now a budding toddler, soon to take their first steps (if they haven't already). Be sure to share all your proud-parent moments with your pediatrician. Here's what you can expect at the 12-month checkup:

## ✅ Immunizations 

At the 12-month visit, your baby may receive vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella (/English/safetyprevention/immunizations/Pages/Measles-Mumps-Rubella-Vaccines-What-You-Need-to-Know.aspx)(MMR), Hepatitis A (/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Hepatitis-A-Vaccine-What-You-Need-to-Know.aspx), and Varicella (/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Chickenpox-Vaccine-What-You-Need-toKnow.aspx) (chickenpox). They may also be due for a booster shot for earlier vaccines. If it's flu season, your doctor will also recommend an influenza (/English/health-issues/conditions/chest-lungs/Pages/The-Flu.aspx) (flu) vaccine. 

## ✅ Screenings 

The doctor will check your child for anemia (/English/health-issues/conditions/chronic/Pages/Anemia-and-YourChild.aspx) at this visit. Based on your child's risk, they may also test blood lead (/English/safety-prevention/allaround/Pages/Blood-Lead-Levels-in-Children-What-Parents-Need-to-Know.aspx) level, hearing, vision, and blood pressure. If your child may have been exposed to tuberculosis (/English/health-issues/conditions/chestlungs/Pages/Tuberculosis.aspx), they can do a skin test. 

## ✅Feeding & development 

Your pediatrician will measure and weigh your baby to make sure their growth (/English/healthissues/conditions/Glands-Growth-Disorders/Pages/Growth-Charts-By-the-Numbers.aspx) is on track. They will also observe their development and behavior, and perform a physical exam. 

## Questions your pediatrician may ask 

 Has your baby tried to stand (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Movement-8-to-12-Months.aspx) or take their first steps without support? 

 How is your baby doing with feeding (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Starting-SolidFoods.aspx) themselves during meals and snacks?

 Do you apply sunscreen (/English/safety-prevention/at-play/Pages/Sun-Safety.aspx) and put a hat on your child when they play outside?

## ✅ Communication tips 

Never hesitate to call your pediatrician's office with any questions or concerns—even if you know the office is closed. If your pediatrician is unable to see you but believes your baby should be examined, they will advise you on the most appropriate place for your baby to receive care and how quickly your baby should be seen. 

 ❓ Did you know By 12 months, your baby's appetite may level off some. This is because they are not growing as quickly as they were during their first year. They may eat a lot at one meal and very little at the next. However, hunger guides them to eat enough over time.
