# Playful Birthday Party Ideas & Tips for Young Children 

## Parents planning a birthday party for their children generally fall into one of two distinct categories: "Can't wait to do 

## it!" versus "Can somebody else do it?" 

## But party planning for kids' birthday parties doesn't have to be stressful. Think of it as a chance for kids to get together 

## and do what they do best: play (/English/family-life/power-of-play/Pages/the-power-of-play-how-fun-and-games-help

## children-thrive.aspx). Here are some tips to keep in mind when planning parties for young children, and ideas for kid

## favorite, festive activities. 

## Birthday party planning tips for young children 

## Guest count guidelines 

## The rule of thumb for babies and toddlers is your child's age, plus one. So, if your kiddo is turning 3, four attendees is a 

## good number of kid guests. If they're turning 4, try to keep the guest list to five kids. Remember, big crowds can 

## overwhelm young kids—not to mention the party-throwing parents. 

## How long the party should last 

## Keep the party under 90 minutes for toddlers; school-aged kids can last about 2-3 hours. And be mindful of naptime 

## (/English/healthy-living/sleep/Pages/healthy-sleep-habits-how-many-hours-does-your-child-need.aspx) if your child 

## is at that stage. 

## Structured but flexible 

## Plan for around 10-15 minutes for each game or activity to keep kids engaged, but if the kiddos are really enjoying 

## something in particular, let 'em play! 

## 3 kids' birthday party ideas 

## 1. Art for all 


#### Build the party around some standing or tabletop easels, give every kid a protective smock and plenty of 

#### art supplies and let the creative fun begin. This is a great to do outdoors when weather permits. Kids can 

#### paint individual masterpieces, or even work together on a mural! 

### Play station activities 

#### Pass the picture: One kid starts a drawing, then passes it to friends to see what they get at the end! 

#### Sidewalk chalk "canvas": This one's a no-brainer for open-ended creativity, especially if you've got the 

#### space. 

#### Kids draw-off: Split kids into two teams, give them cards with simple items to draw, and see how many each 

#### team can get. 

## 2. Obstacle action

#### Set up several stations that'll keep kids moving the whole party—cardboard box "tunnels" to crawl 

#### through, hopscotch or a beanbag toss will provide plenty of fun and action for kids. It's always a good idea 

#### to have some playground balls on hand. 

### Play station activities 

#### Limbo line: How low can kids go? They're closer to the ground, so it's hysterical to watch, and even better to 

#### participate. 

#### Bubble zone: The bubbles bubble never seems to burst for younger kids, so just make sure you've got 

#### enough soap solution on hand; you'd be surprised how fast it goes. (And gets spilled!) 

#### Red light, green light: The classic stop-and-go game builds will keep them guessing when the "light" will 

#### change. 

## 3. Fun on the farm

#### Let the kids fill a few cups with dirt and choose from a variety of vegetable seeds to plant (/English/safety

#### prevention/all-around/Pages/Talking-with-Children-about-Climate-Change.aspx) for their "crops." Let 

#### them sample "harvested" versions of what they're planting—carrots, green beans and cherry tomatoes, 

#### for example. You can have another area where they can create fun farm animal puppets and masks. All 

#### you need is paper plates, paper bags or felt, markers & crayons, bits & bobs from your craft closet, glue, 

#### safety scissors and some adult supervision. 

### Play station activities 

#### Chicken dance: Before it's time for food and cake, they'll build up an appetite flapping their little wings to 

#### this iconic wedding reception staple. 

#### Duck duck goose: Running in circles with a group of toddlers is a sure-fire way to tucker kids out before 

#### they head home. 

#### Pin (or tape) the tail on the donkey: Have the kids close their eyes, turn around and put donkey's tail back 

#### where it goes!
