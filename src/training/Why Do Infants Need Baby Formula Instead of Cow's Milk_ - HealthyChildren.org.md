# Why Do Infants Need Baby Formula Instead of Cow's Milk? 

## Many parents ask why they can't feed their baby regular cow's milk 

## instead of breastmilk (/English/ages

## stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Where-We-Stand

## Breastfeeding.aspx) or formula. There are two main reasons: 

## Infants cannot digest cow's milk as completely or easily as they 

## digest breastmilk or baby formula. And, more importantly, cow's 

## milk does not contain enough of certain nutrients that babies 

## under a year old need. 

## Beyond digestion 

## Cow's milk contains high concentrations of protein and minerals, which can stress a newborn's immature kidneys and 

## cause severe illness at times of heat stress, fever, or diarrhea. In addition, cow's milk lacks the proper amounts of iron, 

## vitamin C, and other nutrients that infants need. It may even cause iron-deficiency anemia (/English/health

## issues/conditions/chronic/Pages/Anemia-and-Your-Child.aspx) in some babies, since cow's milk protein can irritate 

## the lining of the stomach and intestine, leading to loss of blood in the stools. Cow's milk also does not contain the 

## healthiest types of fat for growing babies. For these reasons, your baby should not receive any cow's milk (or other 

## non-human milk or milk substitute) until they are about 12 months of age unless no alternative is available. 

## Once your baby turns a year old 

## Once your baby is past one year old, you may give them pasteurized whole cow's milk or reduced-fat (2%) milk, 

## provided they have a balanced diet of solid foods (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Starting-Solid

## Foods.aspx) (cereals, vegetables, fruits and meats). But limit their intake of milk to 2 cups (about 16 ounces) per day or 

## less. More than 24 ounces a day has been associated with iron deficiency if toddlers aren't getting enough other 

## healthy iron-rich foods. If your baby is not yet eating a broad range of solid foods, talk to your pediatrician about the 

## best nutrition for them. 

## At this age, children still need a higher fat content, which is why whole vitamin D-fortified milk is recommended for 

## most infants after one year of age. If your child is or is at risk for overweight, or if there is a family history 

## (/English/family-life/health-management/Pages/Your-Family-Health-History-and-Genetics.aspx) of obesity, high 

## blood pressure or heart disease, your pediatrician may recommend 2% (reduced-fat) milk. 

## During the current baby formula shortage 

## (https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press

## announcements/fda-takes-important-steps-improve-supply-infant-and-specialty-formula-products) , it 

## may be OK for some babies over 6 months of age to have cow’s milk for a short period of time if no formula is 

## available. If you aren’t able to find baby formula in stock anywhere, talk with your pediatrician and read more

## Age 2 and up 

### Do not give your baby 1% (low-fat) or nonfat (skimmed) milk before their second birthday, as it does not contain 

### enough fat for brain development. After two years of age, you should discuss your child's nutritional needs with 

### your pediatrician. However, many children at this age can transition to lower-fat milk if that is what your family uses.
