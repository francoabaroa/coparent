# Video Games: Establish Your Family’s Own Rating System 

## By: Jeffrey Hutchinson, MD, FAAP 

## Video gaming is a multibillion-dollar industry. It brings 

## in more money than movies and music combined. This 

## isn't a huge surprise considering all the ways games can 

## be played—on computers, game consoles, handheld 

## devices, smart phones and online. Like it or not, video 

## games are likely to be a part of your child's life at some 

## point. 

## As a parent, you get to decide how much time your 

## children or teens spend playing video games. You can 

## also play a key role in monitoring the content of the 

## games your kids play. Just keep in mind that helping them better engage with video games and other digital media can 

## be a challenge for busy families. It's a continuous learning process, not a single success or single mistake. 

## Read on for some tips to help make video gaming a positive part of your child's 

## life. 

## Get familiar with a video game's content before allowing your child or teen to buy it, download it or play it 

## onor offline. As a parent or caregiver, you may not always realize what content video games have. Some include 

## mature themes such as virtual violence (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/Virtual-Violence-Impacts-Childrens

## Behavior.aspx) and mature sexual content. Studies of children exposed to violent media have found that they may 

## become numb to violence. If they're heavily exposed (https://www.commonsensemedia.org/violence-in-the

## media/does-exposure-to-violent-movies-or-video-games-make-kids-more-aggressive) to violence, kids may also 

## imitate it and show more aggressive behavior. 

## Check the Electronic Software Ratings Board (ESRB) ratings. Thousands of video games are available at 

## retailers on and offline. This makes it hard to pinpoint the content of each one. Instead, check the ESRB ratings 

## (http://www.esrb.org/), the video game equivalent of movie ratings. These are a great starting point for choosing 

## games that are appropriate for your family. 

## ESRB ratings are featured clearly (https://www.esrb.org/ratings/where-to-find-ratings/) on the game 

## packaging of physical games. They're commonly found on digital games, virtual reality, and apps too. Ratings 

## range from "Everyone" to "Adults Only." Sometimes marketing materials for boxed games will say "Rating Pending" 

## if the game hasn't been rated yet. 


### Most major retailers have ESRB ratings on their games. Many also verify a person's age before letting them buy a 

### game that's rated M or AO. Members of the ESRB's Retail Council (ERC) (https://www.esrb.org/ratings/retail

### council/) regularly have mystery shoppers (https://www.esrb.org/faqs/#do-video-game-retailers-support-and

### enforce-the-esrb-rating-system) check on how well the stores are complying too. 

### If your child is old enough, have them give you a presentation or "sales pitch" on why they want the game and 

### why you should get it. This method builds valuable skills in children and redirects the energy of finding 

### information back to the person most motivated. 

### Create a media plan for your family. Time spent playing video games can crowd out time for essential 

### activities such as exercise (/English/healthy-living/fitness/Pages/Encouraging-Your-Child-to-be-Physically

### Active.aspx), playing outside, reading or doing school work. Using screens close to bedtime can also disrupt sleep 

### patterns. Our Family Media Use Plan (/English/media/Pages/default.aspx) tool can help you start a discussion 

### about creating healthy media habits, based on your family's needs and values. It can also calculate target lengths 

### of time for your child's daily activities then shows how much time they have left over in the day for screens, 

### including gaming. 

### Consider setting a kitchen timer how long your kids can play video games. When your kids hear the timer go 

### off, gaming time is over. Creating tokens for playtime like the tokens we used for arcades can also help set 

### concrete limits. Another idea is checking-out controllers or power cords from you, the way they might check-out 

### ping pong paddles at a rec center. 

### Check the parental control features (https://www.esrb.org/tools-for-parents/parental-controls/) on your 

### family's game consoles, computers and smartphones. Some allow you restrict certain types of content by age, for 

### example, and schedule time limits for play sessions. 

### Don't allow video games that are at odds with your family's values (/English/family-life/family

### dynamics/communication-discipline/Pages/Share-Your-Values.aspx) inside your home. Explain to your kids that 

### they can't play a new video game until you've had a chance to look it over or research it. Or, ask your kids to 

### present their research, first! It's your right to have a personal rating system in your own home, even if other 

### people choose different standards. 

### Communicate with the parents of your child's friends about rules you set for your child. Good relationships 

### go beyond video games. No one wants to be told how to raise their children, but we're all willing to listen to the 

### thoughts of a friend. They may be willing to put away certain games when your child goes to their home. 

### Keep gaming in a common family area. Just as you do when they're using the internet or watching TV, keep an 

### eye on your kids while they're playing video games. Consider making any handheld gaming consoles family 

### property rather than "owned" by each child. 

### Encourage your child or teen to choose games for multiple players and play with their friends. Technology 

### is a poor substitute for personal interaction. But playing with friends (/English/family-life/work

### play/Pages/what-parents-can-do-to-support-friendships.aspx) can help stop problems with harassment, social 

### isolation and cyberbullying (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/Cyberbullying.aspx). Ask your child regularly 

### which friends they would be embarrassed, uncomfortable or unhappy for you to see playing. If your child plays 

### multiplayer games online, use a shared server or select safe multiplayer games with an "invitation only" privacy 

### setting. 

### If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. Playing a video game with your child or teen will expose you to the lingo of their 

### world. Multiple player video games also allow your entire family to play together. 

## Remember 

### If you have concerns (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/Unhealthy-Video-Gaming.aspx)about your child's video 

### gaming habits or if your child is having difficulty with mood or behavior, talk with your pediatrician. They may refer 

### you to a trained and qualified mental health professional (/English/healthy-living/emotional-wellness/Pages/Mental

### Health-Care-Whos-Who.aspx).
