# Suitable Sleeping Sites: Safe at Night & Naptime 

## By: Laura A. Jana, MD, FAAP & Jennifer Shu, MD, FAAP 

## Before you lay your baby down to sleep at night or for a 

## nap, consider these safety tips and practical 

## considerations. 

## Sleeping solo or filling the 

## family bed 

## Probably since the beginning of time, babies and 

## parents around the world have slept together in what 

## has come to be commonly referred to as "the family 

## bed." But in recent years, particularly in industrialized nations such as the United States, the trend has been to have 

## children sleep separately starting from birth. Given that this trend is in keeping with what we now know to be safest 

## for babies, we suggest you let common sense and a strong commitment to safety prevail. 

## The family bed. Whether because of space limitations, cultural norms, or a strong belief that bed-sharing is an 

## integral part of parenting, parents have slept with their babies for thousands of years. In many parts of the world 

## and in a good 60% of US households, many babies still sleep in bed with their parents, at least on occasion, despite 

## increasing concerns about the associated risks. Followers of attachment parenting seem to feel quite strongly 

## that parents and babies benefit most from bonding whenever possible, including during sleep. Proponents also 

## feel that bed-sharing makes breastfeeding easier. We encourage you to read on for some important things to 

## consider before you opt for the family bed. 

## Sleeping solo. By sleeping solo, we don't mean to imply in a different room, just not in the same bed. In the 

## United States, there has been a definite shift toward placing babies down for sleep independently, whether in a 

## crib, cradle, or bassinet. Our country's movement toward independent sleep may well be, in part, attributable to 

## recent and well-founded concerns that bed-sharing in the first year increases the risk of sleep-related infant 

## deaths. Other practical reasons why parents opt for solo sleeping: they find it to be safer, sounder (for their baby 

## and themselves), and less intrusive on their "adult" time. 

## Bed-sharing safety concerns 

## Many new parents are tempted to take their newborn into bed with them—often out of fatigue and convenience, as 

## well as for cultural and philosophical reasons. Whether bed-sharing is safe, however, has been the subject of much 

## debate. Recent studies suggest that bed-sharing may significantly increase the risk of infant suffocation, so you'll find 

## that many experts (including those responsible for writing AAP policy) now strongly advise against it and instead 

## suggest the very practical and safer alternative of sharing the same room but not the same bed during your baby's first 

## year. If you choose to sleep with your baby in your bed, even if only infrequently, here are some extremely important 

## safety considerations. 

## Make your bed like a crib. The heavy blankets, comforters, pillows, and other accessories typically found on 

## adult beds can suffocate or smother a baby and therefore have no place being in the same location where 

## newborns sleep. (While we're on the subject of simple yet potentially lifesaving measures, we also strongly 

## recommend removing any and all such items that may have already found their way into your baby's crib.) 

## Bed-sharing babies are at risk from falls or the possibility of being trapped between the mattress and the wall, 

## headboard, or other furniture. 

## Bed-sharing and the use of tobacco, alcohol, or drugs don't mix. These substances, including over-the

## counter or prescription medications, all have the distinct potential to cause excessive drowsiness or impaired 

## judgment, making those who choose to indulge at risk of being less aware of a baby in the bed. 


## Crib safety considerations 

#### Whether you decide to set up a crib for your baby as soon as your pregnancy test turns positive or months after your 

#### newborn's much-anticipated arrival, there are a few general safety principles that you'll want to follow to ensure your 

#### baby's safety. Some may not seem particularly relevant during your baby's first few months, but given that cribs tend 

#### to be big-ticket items and the one you invest in is going to be put to the test for years to come as your baby learns to 

#### roll, sit, stand and climb in it, it's well worth considering present and future safety concerns. 

#### Crib slats. The slats should be no more than 2-3/8 inches apart. All new cribs must meet this standard, but older 

#### cribs may not. Avoid using any crib that does not meet this 2011 standard. 

#### Posts & cutouts. Steer clear of bedposts taller than 1/16th of an inch (we realize that's almost nothing, but that's 

#### the point) and/or cutouts in the headboard or any other parts of the crib, where a baby's or toddler's body parts 

#### could get stuck. 

#### Bumpers and pillows. Yes, they're soft and cute. But soft and cute should not be your deciding factor. For safety's 

#### sake, keep crib bumpers and pillows out of your baby's crib. 

#### Crib toys. They may seem harmless, entertaining, cute and cuddly, but keep all stuffed animals (and most toys) 

#### out of your newborn's crib because they can pose a small but nevertheless real safety risk. The exceptions are the 

#### types of toys that strap securely to the side of the crib. Some babies like mirrors or toys with parts they can play 

#### with (such as spinners, rattles, and music), but your newborn probably won't be terribly interested in them for at 

#### least a few weeks. 

#### Mobiles. Mobiles are special hanging toys designed to entertain your baby and can be attached to the crib, 

#### ceiling or wall. Some are even adorned with lights or play music. They are fun but definitely optional. If you do 

#### choose to use mobiles, make sure they do not hang low enough to entangle your baby, especially once they begin 

#### to roll. In fact, once your baby is able to sit up, it will definitely be time for their mobile to come down. 

#### Crib placement. Unless you don't mind a bit of redecorating and rearranging when your baby starts to get 

#### around, we suggest you place your crib well away from any windows and no less than an arm's reach away from 

#### any nearby dressers or tabletops. Knowing that it won't be long before anything and everything within reach will 

#### be fair game, we also recommend limiting your over-the-crib wall decorations to painted walls and wallpaper. 

#### Picture frames and mirrors over cribs may be cute, but they are also injuries waiting to happen. Be forewarned 

#### that while they may be safe, even paper borders placed within reach of the crib don't often stand up well to prying 

#### fingers. 

#### Firm-fitting mattress/fitted sheet. While they seem to be mostly standardized, cribs and mattresses can and do 

#### come in more than one size. So be sure to double-check measurements and read labels to make sure you end up 

#### with a mattress that fits snugly into your chosen crib. Any extra space between the mattress and crib frame has 

#### the potential to trap a baby's arm, leg or head. Also make sure your fitted sheets are tight enough that they don't 

#### slip off easily, thus posing a serious safety hazard. 

#### Tooth-resistant rails. Some railings are covered by a special plastic to prevent teething babies from gnawing on 

#### the paint or wood. 

#### Adjustable mattress height. Many cribs have adjustable heights so you can lower the mattress as your baby 

#### gets taller, making it more difficult for them to climb out. You will likely want to keep it at the highest level while 

#### your newborn is relatively immobile and you are coming and going frequently because it will allow you to save a 

#### good deal of strain on your back. Remember that by the time your baby is able to sit or stand up, you'll want to 

#### lower the level of the crib mattress accordingly. 

## Bare is best when it comes to cribs 

#### If you come to find that the excitement you feel about having a new baby is wrapped up in the buying of a fancy baby 

#### bedding set complete with bumper and quilted blanket, we suggest you work on changing your mindset rather than 

#### your nursery décor. Simply remember that the AAP recommends that nothing but a snugly fitted sheet be placed with 

#### your baby in the crib during the first year. 

## Why drop-side cribs are a thing of the past 

#### In years past, crib railings were almost always adjustable—meaning you could raise and lower one or both side 

#### railings. While this feature had long been appealing to parents as a convenience, it became a safety concern. 

#### Numerous injuries from crib side-rails resulted in the largest crib recall in history (2.1 million cribs!) in 2009. As a 

##### Back to Top 


#### result, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), which sets voluntary industry safety standards, required 

#### that going forward, all full-sized cribs be manufactured with 4 immovable sides. The take-home message for all 

#### parents: Always check out the latest safety information on the CPSC website (https://www.cpsc.gov/) before dropping 

#### your guard.
