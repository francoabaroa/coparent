# Emotional Development: 2 Year Olds 

## It can be difficult to follow the ups and downs of a two

## year-old. One moment they're beaming and friendly; 

## the next sullen and weepy—and often for no apparent 

## reason. These mood swings, however, are just part of 

## growing up. They are signs of the emotional changes 

## taking place as your child struggles to control actions, 

## impulses, feelings and their body. 

## Testing limits 

## At this age, your child wants to explore the world and 

## seek adventure. They'll spend most of their time testing 

## limits—their own, yours, and their environment's. 

## Unfortunately, they still lack many skills required to safely accomplish everything they needs to do, and they often will 

## need your protection. 

## When they overstep a limit and are pulled back, they often react with anger and frustration, a temper tantrum or 

## sullen rage. They may even hit, bite or kick. At this age, they just don't have much control over their emotional 

## impulses. Their anger and frustration tend to erupt suddenly in the form of crying, hitting or screaming. It's their only 

## way of dealing with the difficult realities of life. They may even act out in ways that unintentionally harm themselves 

## or others. It's all part of being two. 

## Emotional milestones for your two-year-old 

## Expresses affection openly 

## Expresses a wide range of emotions 

## Objects to major changes in routine 

## Why does my 2-year-old behave better with the sitter than with me? 

## Have sitters (/English/family-life/work-and-child-care/Pages/finding-a-sitter.aspx) or relatives ever told you that your 

## child never behaves badly when they're caring for them? It's not uncommon for toddlers to be angels when you're not 

## around. They don't trust these other people enough to test their limits. But with you, your two-year-old is willing to try 

## things that may be dangerous or difficult because they know you'll rescue them if needed. 

## Separation anxiety: how to react 

## Whatever protest pattern they developed around the end of their first year probably will last for some time. When 

## you're about to leave them with a sitter, they may become angry and throw a tantrum in anticipation of the separation 

## (/English/ages-stages/toddler/Pages/Soothing-Your-Childs-Separation-Anxiety.aspx). They may whimper, whine or 

## cling to you. Or they could become subdued and silent. 

## Whatever their behavior, try not to overreact by scolding or punishing. The best tactic is to reassure them you will be 

## back and, when you return, to praise them for being so patient while you were gone. Take solace in the fact that 

## separations should be much easier by the time they're three. 

## Boosting your two-year-old's confidence & behavior 

## The more confident and secure your two-year-old feels, the more independent and well behaved they're likely to be. 

## You can help them develop these positive feelings by encouraging them to behave more maturely. Consistently set 

## reasonable limits that allow them to explore and exercise their curiosity, but draw the line at dangerous or antisocial 

## behavior. They'll soon begin to sense what's acceptable and what's not.

### The key is consistency. Praise them every time they plays well with another child, or whenever they feed, dress or 

### undresses themselves without help, or when they complete an activity by themself. When you do this, they'll start to 

### feel good about these accomplishments and themself. With their self-esteem on the rise, they'll develop an image of 

### themself as someone who behaves the way you have encouraged—and negative behavior will fade. 

## Remember 

### Since two-year-olds normally express a broad range of emotions, be prepared for everything from delight to rage. 

### However, you should consult your pediatrician if your child seems very passive or withdrawn, perpetually sad, or 

### highly demanding and unsatisfied most of the time. These could be signs of depression, caused either by hidden 

### stress or biological problems. If your doctor suspects depression, they'll likely refer your child to a mental health 

### professional for a consultation.
