# Crawling Styles 

## Watching your baby learn to crawl and move 

## independently can be a truly memorable time. Take 

## advantage of this brief period; before you know it, your 

## little one will be pulling up, standing, and walking. Not 

## every infant crawls in the traditional manner. 

## Different crawling styles include: 

## Classic hands-and-knees or cross crawl. This is 

## when babies bear weight on their hands and 

## knees, then moves one arm and the opposite knee 

## forward at the same time. 

## Bear crawl. This looks like the classic crawl, but babies who do this keep their elbows and knees straight, 

## walking on hands and feet like a bear. 

## Belly or commando crawl. Baby's who favor the military-style crawl move their bodies forward while dragging 

## their bellies against the floor. 

## Bottom scooter. Babies scoot around on their bottom using their arms to move forward. 

## Crab crawl. Moving backward or sideways like a crab, babies propel themselves with their hands. 

## Rolling crawl. Babies with style of crawl get to their destination by rolling from one place to another. 

## Exploration and experiences affect a child's earliest learning, which shows why it's important for parents to encourage 

## the development of their child's motor skills. 

## Tummy time (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/The-Importance-of-Tummy-Time.aspx) provides a foundation 

## for the skill of crawling. Floor time and crawling play an important role in your child's development!
