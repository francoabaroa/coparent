### Each baby develops in his own manner, so it’s impossible to tell exactly when your child will perfect a given skill. 

### Although the developmental milestones listed in this book will give you a general idea of the changes you can expect 

### as your child gets older, don’t be alarmed if his development takes a slightly different course. Alert your pediatrician if 

### your baby displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay in the eight-to twelve-month age range. 

### Does not crawl 

### Drags one side of body while crawling (for over one month)
