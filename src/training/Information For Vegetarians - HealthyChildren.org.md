# Information For Vegetarians 

## A special diet is often a healthy diet—in fact, you may maintain a particular diet for health 

## reasons—but it still may not provide all the nutrients you and your baby need while 

## breastfeeding. 

## If your consumption of any major food group is limited, consider how you will replace the 

## missing elements in your diet, and discuss your plans with your doctor or nutritionist. 

## Breastfeeding women who do not eat meat, for example, must figure out how they will get 

## sufficient protein for their babies and themselves. 

## As a vegetarian, you may already be familiar with ways to combine plant foods to meet your needs. You may get 

## protein from rice, beans, eggs, nuts and nut butters, and meat substitutes. If you do not know all the healthy ways to 

## compensate for lack of meat in your diet, consult a registered dietitian. 

## Ask your pediatrician whether you should take a daily vitamin/mineral supplement containing such elements as iron, 

## zinc, and vitamin B12. It is essential that strict vegans (who avoid all animal products in their diet) take a vitamin B12 

## supplement, since this nutrient comes only from animal sources. Keep in mind that you will also need to make sure 

## you consume enough calories to maintain your health—usually between 2,200 and 2,500 per day if you are of average 

## build. 

## If you have any special concerns about your diet, your pediatrician may suggest you consult with a registered 

## dietitian.
