# Physical Appearance and Growth: Your 2 Year Old 

## Although your toddler’s growth rate will slow between his second and third birthdays, 

## nevertheless he will continue his remarkable physical transformation from baby to child. The 

## most dramatic change will occur in his bodily proportions. As an infant, he had a relatively large 

## head and short legs and arms; now his head growth will slow, from 3⁄4 inch (2 cm) in his second 

## year alone to 3⁄4 to 1 1⁄4 inches (2–3 cm) over the next ten years. At the same time, his height will 

## increase, primarily because his legs and, to some degree, the rest of his body will be growing 

## quickly. With these changes in the rates of growth, his body and legs will look much more in 

## proportion. 

## The baby fat that seemed to make your infant so cuddly in the first months of life gradually will disappear during 

## these preschool years. The percentage of fat, which reached a peak at age one, will steadily decrease to approximately 

## half that by his fifth birthday. Notice how his arms and thighs become more slender and his face less round. Even the 

## pads of fat under the arches, which have until now given the appearance of flat feet, will disappear. 

## His posture will change, as well, during this time. His pudgy, babyish look as a toddler has been partly due to his 

## posture, particularly his protruding abdomen and inwardly curving lower back. But as his muscle tone improves and 

## his posture becomes more erect, he’ll develop a longer, leaner, stronger appearance. 

## Although it will happen more slowly now, your child will continue to grow steadily. Preschoolers grow an average of 2 

## 1⁄2 inches (6 cm) annually and gain about 4 pounds (2 kg) each year. Plot your child’s height and weight on growth 

## charts to compare his rate of growth to the average for this age. If you should notice a pronounced lapse in growth, 

## discuss it with your pediatrician. She probably will tell you there is no need to become overly concerned, as some 

## healthy children just may not grow as quickly during their second and third years as their playmates seem to do. 

## Less commonly, this pause in growth during the toddler or preschool years may signal something else—perhaps a 

## chronic health problem, such as kidney or liver disease, or a recurrent infection. In rare cases, slow growth may be 

## due to a disorder of one of the hormone glands or to gastrointestinal complications of some chronic illnesses. Your 

## pediatrician will take all of these things into consideration when she examines your child. 

## At the age of two, don’t be surprised if your child is eating less than you think he should. Children need fewer calories 

## at this time because they’re growing more slowly. But even though he’s eating less, he still can remain well nourished 

## as long as you make a variety of healthy foods available to him. Encourage healthy snacks and begin establishing 

## sound and healthful eating habits. At the same time, if he seems overly preoccupied with food and appears to be 

## accumulating excess weight, talk to your pediatrician about ways to help manage his weight. Early eating behaviors 

## can influence the risk of obesity throughout life, so managing your child’s weight in childhood is as important as it is 

## at any stage of life.
