# Starting Solid Foods 

## Which infant cereal or other foods will be on the menu 

## for your baby's first solid meal? Have you set a date? 

## At this point, you may have a plan or are confused 

## because you have received too much advice from 

## family and friends with different opinions. 

## Here is information from the American Academy of 

## Pediatrics (AAP) to help you prepare for your baby's 

## transition to solid foods. 

## When can my baby begin solid 

## foods? 

## Remember that each child's readiness for solid foods depends on their own rate of development. 

## Can they hold their head up? Your baby should be able to sit in a high chair, a feeding seat or an infant seat with 

## good head control. 

## Do they open their mouth when food comes their way? Babies may be ready if they watch you eating, reach for 

## your food and seem eager to be fed. 

## Can they move food from a spoon into their throat? If you offer a spoon of cereal, they push it out of their 

## mouth and it dribbles onto their chin, they may not yet be able to move it to the back of their mouth to swallow it. 

## That's normal. Remember, they have never had anything thicker than breast milk (/English/ages

## stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Working-Together-Breastfeeding-and-Solid-Foods.aspx) or formula before, 

## and this may take some getting used to. Try diluting it the first few times; then, gradually thicken the texture. You 

## may also want to wait a week or two and try again. 

## Is your baby big enough? Generally, when infants double their birth weight (typically at about 4 months of age) 

## and weigh about 13 pounds or more, they may be ready for solid foods. 

## NOTE: The AAP recommends (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Where-We-Stand

## Breastfeeding.aspx) providing your baby only breastmilk for approximately 6 months after birth. After that, the AAP 

## supports continued breastfeeding, along with introductory foods. You should continue breastfeeding after 

## introducing foods at six months for as long as you and your child wish, for 2 years or beyond. Check with your child's 

## doctor about the recommendations for vitamin D and iron supplements (/English/healthy

## living/nutrition/Pages/Vitamin-D-And-Your-Baby.aspx) during the first year.

## How do I feed my baby? 

##### Start with half a spoonful or less and talk to your baby through the process ("Mmm, see how good this is?"). Your baby 

##### may not know what to do at first. They may look confused, wrinkle their nose, roll the food around inside their mouth 

##### or reject it altogether. 

##### One way to make eating solids for the first time easier is to give your baby a little breast milk, formula or both first; 

##### then switch to very small half-spoonfuls of food; and finish with more breast milk or formula. This will prevent your 

##### baby from getting frustrated when they are very hungry. 

##### Do not be surprised if most of the first few solid-food feedings wind up on your baby's face, hands and bib. Increase the 

##### amount of food gradually, with just a teaspoonful or two to start. This allows your baby time to learn how to swallow 

##### solids. 

##### If your baby cries or turns away when you feed them, do not make them eat. Go back to breastfeeding or bottle

##### feeding exclusively for a time before trying again. Remember that starting solid foods is a gradual process; at first, 

##### your baby will still be getting most of their nutrition from breast milk, formula or both. Also, each baby is different, so 

##### readiness to start solid foods will vary. 

#### NOTE: Do not put baby cereal in a bottle (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Cereal-in-a-Bottle-Solid

#### Food-Shortcuts-to-Avoid.aspx) because your baby could choke. It may also increase the amount of food your baby eats 

#### and can cause your baby to gain too much weight. However, cereal in a bottle may be recommended if your baby has 

#### reflux (/English/health-issues/conditions/abdominal/Pages/GERD-Reflux.aspx). Check with your child's doctor.

## Which food should I give my baby first? 

##### Your baby's first foods are your choice. Whether you decide to make your own baby food or buy premade baby food, 

##### you have many options. However, keep the following in mind: 

##### Foods should be soft or pureed to prevent choking (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/Choking

##### Hazards-Parents-of-Young-Children-Should-Know-About.aspx). 

##### Introduce one "single-ingredient" new food from any food group every 3 to 5 days. Look out for any reactions. 

##### There is no evidence that waiting to introduce baby-safe (soft) foods, such as eggs, dairy, soy, peanut products or 

##### fish (/English/news/Pages/AAP-Says-US-Children-Not-Eating-Enough-Seafood.aspx), beyond 4 to 6 months of 

##### age prevents food allergy. However, testing for peanut allergy (/English/health-issues/conditions/allergies

##### asthma/Pages/Peanut-Allergies-What-You-Should-Know-About-the-Latest-Research.aspx) is recommended 

##### for babies with severe eczema and/or egg allergy. Check with your child's doctor about how and when to give 

##### peanut products. 

##### There is no evidence that your baby will develop a dislike for vegetables if fruit is given first. 

##### Be sure to include foods that provide iron and zinc, such as baby food made with meat or iron-fortified cereals. 

##### If you feed your baby premade cereal, make sure it is made for babies and is iron fortified. Baby cereals are 

##### available premixed in individual containers or dry, to which you can add breast milk, formula, or water. 

##### Within a few months of starting solid foods, your baby's daily diet should include a variety (/English/ages

##### stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Metals-in-Baby-Food.aspx) of foods, such as breast milk, formula or both; 

##### meats; cereal; vegetables; fruits; eggs; and fish. 

## When can I give my baby finger foods? 

##### Once your baby can sit up and bring their hands or other objects to their mouth, you can give them finger foods to 

##### help them learn to feed themselves. To prevent choking (/English/health-issues/conditions/chronic/Pages/Anemia

##### and-Your-Child.aspx), make sure anything you give your baby is soft, easy to swallow, and cut into small pieces. Some 

##### examples include small pieces of banana, wafer-type cookies or crackers; scrambled eggs; well-cooked pasta; well

##### cooked, finely chopped chicken; and well-cooked, cut-up potatoes or peas. 

##### At each of your baby's daily meals, they should be eating about 4 ounces, or the amount in one small jar of strained 

##### baby food. Limit giving your baby processed foods that are made for adults and older children. These foods often 

##### contain more salt and other preservatives. 

##### If you want to give your baby fresh food (/English/tips-tools/ask-the-pediatrician/Pages/Is-it-OK-to-make-my-own

##### baby-food.aspx), use a blender or food processor, or just mash softer foods with a fork. All fresh foods should be cooked 

##### with no added salt or seasoning. Although you can feed your baby raw bananas (mashed), most other fruits and 

##### vegetables should be cooked until they are soft. Refrigerate any food you do not use, and look for any signs of spoilage 

##### before giving it to your baby. Fresh foods are not bacteria-free, so they will spoil more quickly than food from a can or 

##### jar. 

#### NOTE: Do not give your baby any food that requires chewing at this age, or any food that can be a choking hazard. 

#### Foods to avoid include hot dogs (including meat sticks, or baby food "hot dogs"); nuts and seeds; chunks of meat or 

#### cheese; whole grapes; popcorn; chunks of peanut butter; raw vegetables; fruit chunks, such as apple chunks; and hard, 

#### gooey, or sticky candy. 

## What changes can I expect after my baby starts solids? 

##### When your baby starts eating solid foods, their stools will become more solid and variable in color. Because of the 

##### added sugars and fats, they will have a much stronger odor, too. Peas and other green vegetables may turn the stool a 

##### deep-green color; beets may make it red. (Beets sometimes make urine red as well.) 

##### If your baby's meals are not strained, their stools may contain undigested pieces of food, especially hulls of peas or 

##### corn, and the skin of tomatoes or other vegetables. All of this is normal. Your baby's digestive system is still immature 

##### and needs time before it can fully process these new foods. If the stools are extremely loose, watery, or full of mucus, 

##### however, it may mean the digestive tract is irritated. In this case, reduce the amount of solids and introduce them 

##### more slowly. If the stools continue to be loose, watery, or full of mucus, talk with your child's doctor to find the reason.

## Should I give my baby juice? 

##### Babies do not need juice (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Fruit-Juice-and-Your-Childs-Diet.aspx). Babies 

##### younger than 12 months should not be given juice. After 12 months of age (up to 3 years of age), give only 100% fruit 

##### juice and no more than 4 ounces a day. Offer it only in a cup, not in a bottle. To help prevent tooth decay 

##### (/English/ages-stages/baby/teething-tooth-care/Pages/How-to-Prevent-Tooth-Decay-in-Your-Baby.aspx), do not put 

##### your child to bed with a bottle. If you do, make sure it contains only water. Juice reduces the appetite for other, more 

##### nutritious, foods, including breast milk, formula, or both. Too much juice can also cause diaper rash, diarrhea or 

##### excessive weight gain. 

## Does my baby need water? 

##### Healthy babies do not need extra water. Breast milk, formula, or both provide all the fluids they need. However, it is OK 

##### to offer a little water (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/recommended-drinks-for-young-children-ages-0

##### 5.aspx) when you begin to give your baby solid foods. Use an open, sippy or strawed cup and limit water to no more 

##### than 1 cup (8 ounces) each day. Also, a small amount of water may be needed in very hot weather. If you live in an area 

##### where the water is fluoridated (/English/healthy-living/oral-health/Pages/Water-Fluoridation.aspx), drinking water 

##### will also help prevent future tooth decay. 

## Good eating habits start early 

##### It is important for your baby to get used to the process of eating—sitting up, taking food from a spoon, resting between 

##### bites and stopping when full. These early experiences will help your child learn good eating habits throughout life. 

##### Encourage family meals (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/Pages/Mealtime-as-Family-Time.aspx) from the first 

##### feeding. When you can, the whole family should eat together. Research suggests that having dinner together, as a 

##### family, on a regular basis has positive effects on the development of children. 

##### Remember to offer a good variety of healthy foods that are rich in the nutrients your child needs. Watch your child 

##### for cues that they have had enough to eat. Do not overfeed! 

##### If you have any questions about your child's nutrition, including concerns about your child eating too much or too 

##### little, talk with your child's doctor.
