# Your Checkup Checklist: 18 Months Old 

## At a year-and-a-half old, your toddler is excited to be 

## learning more skills. Having mastered walking, they 

## may now be climbing onto chairs and other short 

## pieces of furniture without help. You may find them 

## beaming and clapping for themselves after these 

## impressive feats, looking to you for praise. 

## Your 18-month-old may insist on going wherever they 

## want one moment, then cling to you the next. They do 

## this to remind themselves of their secure emotional 

## base, which gives them the confidence to explore. Extra 

## patience and a sense of humor can help you with the 

## tough task of setting limits and then regularly 

## reinforcing them. 

## At the 18-month wellness visit, the pediatrician will perform a complete physical exam and check your child's 

## progress toward important milestones. Here's what else you can expect at this checkup: 

## ✅ Immunizations 

## Depending on vaccines your child received at their previous visits, they may be due for a dose of HepA (hepatitis A), 

## for example, or DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis). If it's flu season, your doctor will also recommend an 

## influenza (/English/health-issues/conditions/chest-lungs/Pages/The-Flu.aspx) (flu) vaccine. See "Vaccines Your Child 

## Needs by Age 6 (/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Your-Babys-First-Vaccines.aspx) ." 

## ✅ Health Screenings 

## Based on your child's risk factors or any symptoms or concerns, your pediatrician may screen and recommend tests 

## for anemia, lead (/English/safety-prevention/all-around/Pages/Lead-Screening-for-Children.aspx) poisoning, blood 

## pressure, hearing or vision (/English/health-issues/conditions/eyes/Pages/Vision-Screenings.aspx) problems. Unless 

## your child has already visited the dentist, your pediatrician will check for any new teeth (/English/healthy-living/oral

## health/Pages/Brushing-Up-on-Oral-Health-Never-Too-Early-to-Start.aspx) that need an application of fluoride 

## varnish. Teeth that were treated with varnish at least 6 months ago get another application. 

## ✅Developmental Screenings 

## Your pediatrician will measure and weigh your baby to make sure their growth (/English/health

## issues/conditions/Glands-Growth-Disorders/Pages/Growth-Charts-By-the-Numbers.aspx) is on track. They will also 

## discuss any questions you have about your child's behavior and development. In addition, they will ask you to 

## complete developmental and autism spectrum disorder (/English/health-issues/conditions/Autism/Pages/How

## Doctors-Screen-for-Autism.aspx) screening questionnaires. These tools help pediatricians and families decide if more 

## evaluations are needed and if a child might benefit from early intervention services like speech and physical therapy. 

## Questions your pediatrician may ask 

## Does your child engage with others for play (/English/family-life/power-of-play/Pages/default.aspx)? Have they 

## started to enjoy scribbling or pretend play?

## Do they point to pictures in a book, or to show you something interesting?
