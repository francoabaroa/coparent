# Safety for Your Child: Birth to 6 Months 

## Did you know that hundreds of children younger than 1 year die every 

## year in the United States because of injuries — most of which could be 

## prevented? 

## Often, injuries happen because parents are not aware of what their 

## children can do. Children learn fast, and before you know it, your 

## child will be wiggling off a bed or reaching for your cup of hot 

## coffee. 

## Car Injuries 

## Car crashes are a great threat to your child’s life and health. Most 

## injuries and deaths from car crashes can be prevented by the use of 

## car safety seats (/English/safety-prevention/on-the-go/Pages/Car-Safety-Seats-Information-for-Families.aspx). Your 

## child, besides being much safer in a car safety seat, will behave better, so you can pay attention to your driving. Make 

## your newborn’s first ride home from the hospital a safe one — in a car safety seat. Your infant should ride in the back 

## seat in a rear-facing (/English/safety-prevention/on-the-go/Pages/Rear-Facing-Car-Seats-for-Infants-Toddlers.aspx) 

## car seat. 

## Make certain that your baby’s car safety seat is installed correctly. Read and follow the instructions that come 

## with the car safety seat and the sections in the owners’ manual of your car on using car safety seats correctly. 

## Use the car safety seat EVERY time your child is in the car. 

## NEVER put an infant in the front seat of a car with a passenger air bag (/English/safety-prevention/on-the

## go/Pages/Air-Bag-Safety.aspx). 

## Falls 

## Babies wiggle and move and push against things with their feet soon after they are born. Even these very first 

## movements can result in a fall. As your baby grows and is able to roll over, he or she may fall off of things unless 

## protected. Do not leave your baby alone on changing tables (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/Changing

## Table-Safety.aspx), beds, sofas, or chairs. Put your baby in a safe place such as a crib or playpen when you cannot hold 

## him. 

## Your baby may be able to crawl as early as 6 months. Use gates on stairways and close doors to keep your baby out of 

## rooms where he or she might get hurt. Install operable window guards on all windows above the first floor. 

## Do not use a baby walker (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/baby-walkers-a-dangerous-choice.aspx). Your 

## baby may tip the walker over, fall out of it, or fall down stairs and seriously injure his head. Baby walkers let children 

## get to places where they can pull heavy objects or hot food on themselves. 

## If your child has a serious fall or does not act normally after a fall, call your doctor. 

## Burns 

## At 3 to 5 months, babies will wave their fists and grab at things. NEVER carry your baby and hot liquids, such as coffee, 

## or foods at the same time. Your baby can get burned (/English/health-issues/injuries-emergencies/Pages/Treating

## and-Preventing-Burns.aspx). You can’t handle both! To protect your child from tap water scalds, the hottest 

## temperature at the faucet should be no more than 120°F. In many cases you can adjust your water heater. 

## If your baby gets burned, immediately put the burned area in cold water. Keep the burned area in cold water for a few 

## minutes to cool it off. Then cover the burn loosely with a dry bandage or clean cloth and call your doctor. 

## To protect your baby from house fires (/English/safety-prevention/all-around/Pages/Fire-Safety.aspx), be sure you 

## have a working smoke alarm on every level of your home, especially in furnace and sleeping areas. Test the alarms 

## every month. It is best to use smoke alarms that use long-life batteries, but if you do not, change the batteries at least

### once a year. 

## Choking and Suffocation 

### Babies explore their environment by putting anything and everything into their mouths. NEVER leave small objects in 

### your baby’s reach, even for a moment. NEVER feed your baby hard pieces of food such as chunks of raw carrots, 

### apples, hot dogs, grapes, peanuts, and popcorn. Cut all the foods you feed your baby into thin pieces to prevent choking 

### (/English/health-issues/injuries-emergencies/Pages/Choking-Prevention.aspx). Be prepared if your baby starts to 

### choke. Ask your doctor to recommend the steps you need to know. Learn how to save the life of a choking child. 

### To prevent possible suffocation and reduce the risk of sudden infant dealth syndrome (SIDS (/English/ages

### stages/baby/sleep/Pages/Preventing-SIDS.aspx)), your baby should always sleep on his or her back. Your baby should 

### have his or her own crib (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/suitable-sleeping-sites.aspx) or bassinet with no 

### pillows, stuffed toys, bumpers, or loose bedding. NEVER put your baby on a water bed, bean bag, or anything that is soft 

### enough to cover the face and block air to the nose and mouth. 

### Plastic wrappers and bags form a tight seal if placed over the mouth and nose and may suffocate your child. Keep 

### them away from your baby.
