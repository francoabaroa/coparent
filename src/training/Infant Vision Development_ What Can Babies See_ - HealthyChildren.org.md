# Infant Vision Development: What Can Babies See? 

## What can my baby see during the first 

## year of life? 

## A baby's vision develops quickly during the first year of life. 

## Newborns: Can see large shapes and faces, as well as bright 

## colors. 

## By 3 to 4 months: Most babies can focus on a variety of smaller 

## objects and tell the difference between colors (especially red 

## and green). 

## By 4 months : A baby's eyes should be working together. This is when babies begin to develop depth perception 

## (binocular vision). 

## By 12 months: A child's vision reaches normal adult levels while he continues to learn about and understand 

## what he sees. 

## Keep in mind that each child's vision develops at his or her own rate, but the overall pattern of development is the 

## same. Because a baby's vision develops quickly during the first year of life, your child's doctor will check your baby's 

## eyes at each well-child visit (/English/family-life/health-management/Pages/Well-Child-Care-A-Check-Up-for

## Success.aspx). 

## Even after the first year, regular eye exams (/English/health-issues/conditions/eyes/Pages/Vision-Screenings.aspx) by 

## your child's doctor are important to identify problems that may arise later in childhood.
