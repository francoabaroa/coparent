# Amount and Schedule of Baby Formula Feedings 

## In the first week after birth, babies should be eating no more 

## than about 1 to 2 ounces (30 to 60 ml) per feed. 

## During the first month , babies gradually eat more until they 

## take 3 to 4 ounces (90 to 120 ml) per feed, amounting to 32 

## ounces per day. Formula-fed babies typically feed on a more 

## regular schedule, such as every 3 or 4 hours. Breastfed 

## (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Where-We

## Stand-Breastfeeding.aspx) babies usually take smaller, more 

## frequent feedings than formula-fed infants. 

## By the end of the first month: Your baby will be up to at least 3 to 4 ounces (120 mL) per feeding, with a fairly 

## predictable schedule of feedings about every 3 to 4 hours. 

## By 6 months: Your baby will consume 6 to 8 ounces (180–240 mL) at each of 4 or 5 feedings in 24 hours. 

## Formula feeding based on body weight 

## On average, your baby should take in about 2½ ounces (75 mL) of infant formula a day for every pound (453 g) of 

## body weight. But they probably will regulate their intake from day to day to meet their own specific needs, so let them 

## tell you when they've had enough. If they become fidgety or easily distracted during a feeding, they're probably 

## finished. If they drain the bottle and continues smacking their lips, they might still be hungry. 

## There are high and low limits, however. If your baby consistently seems to want more or less than this, discuss it with 

## your pediatrician. Your baby should usually drink no more than an average of about 32 ounces (960 mL) of formula in 

## 24 hours. Some babies have higher needs for sucking and may just want to suck on a pacifier after feeding. 

## On-demand feeding 

## Initially it is best to feed your formula-fed newborn a bottle on demand, or whenever they cry (/English/ages

## stages/baby/crying-colic/Pages/Responding-to-Your-Babys-Cries.aspx)with hunger. As time passes, your baby will 

## begin to develop a fairly regular timetable of their own. As you become familiar with their signals and needs, you'll be 

## able to schedule their feedings around their routine. 

## Eating & sleeping patterns 

## Between 2 and 4 months of age (or when the baby weighs more than 12 lb. [5.4 kg]), most formula-fed babies no longer 

## need a middle-of-the-night feedings. They're consuming more during the day, and their sleeping patterns have 

## become more regular (although this varies considerably from baby to baby). Their stomach capacity has increased, 

## too, which means they may go longer between daytime feedings—occasionally up to 4 or 5 hours at a time. 

## If your baby still seems to feed very frequently or consume larger amounts, try distracting them with play 

## (/English/family-life/power-of-play/Pages/default.aspx) or with a pacifier. Sometimes patterns of obesity begin during 

## infancy, so it is important not to overfeed (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/How-Often-and-How

## Much-Should-Your-Baby-Eat.aspx) your baby. 

## If your baby sleeps (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/default.aspx) longer than 4 to 5 hours during the 

## first few weeks after birth and starts missing feedings, wake them up and offer a bottle.

## Getting to know your baby's feeding needs 

### The most important thing to remember, whether you breastfeed or bottlefeed, is that your baby's feeding needs 

### are unique. No book―or website―can tell you precisely how much or how often they need to be fed or exactly how 

### you should handle them during feedings. You will discover these things for yourself as you and your baby get to know 

### each other.
