# Colostrum: Your Baby's First Meal 

## Colostrum provides all the nutrients and fluid that your newborn needs in the early days, as well 

## as many substances to protect your baby against infections. Its color and thickness are due to the 

## fact that it is higher in these protective factors. (Compared with more mature human milk, 

## colostrum is also higher in protein, slightly lower in sugar, and significantly lower in fat.) 

## While your breasts will not feel full the day that you give birth, you already have enough 

## colostrum to nourish your baby. Your body will produce colostrum for several days after delivery 

## until your milk increases in amount and becomes more creamy or white in color—a time that 

## mothers frequently refer to as the milk “coming in.” 

## First Feeding 

## Your baby will be born with a suckling instinct, though it is stronger in some babies than in others. Since this instinct 

## is intense immediately after birth, it is best to introduce him to the breast within the first hour or so of life. Not only 

## will his suckling at your breast stimulate your breasts to produce more milk, thus beginning the establishment of a 

## reliable milk supply, but it will signal your uterus to contract and decrease the chance of excessive bleeding after 

## delivery. 

## This first feeding will also help him begin to learn how to nurse. Placing the newborn baby skin to skin against your 

## chest will help to encourage your baby to smell the colostrum and want to latch on and begin his first feeding. In fact, 

## the initial phase of breastfeeding is a learning process for both mother and baby. 

## Some newborns show little initial interest in nursing. Fortunately, newborns do not need much fluid, and their 

## mothers’ breasts contain only small amounts of the very important colostrum. At this stage, it is more important that 

## babies feed frequently than it is for them to feed for long periods of time. Since the breasts are not yet extremely full 

## of milk, they remain soft and supple after delivery, making it easier for the baby to learn to suckle. 

## In these early days, it is normal for a baby to lose some weight. This weight loss consists of extra fluid accumulated 

## during pregnancy. In the days after delivery, your baby’s appetite and need for fluids will increase. Approximately two 

## to five days after birth, the colostrum production will give way to a higher volume of transitional milk.
