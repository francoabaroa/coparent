# Dangerous Internet Challenges – Understanding Their 

# Appeal to Kids 

## Internet challenges can be fascinating to teens 

## (/English/ages-stages/teen/Pages/Stages-of

## Adolescence.aspx), who can be both impulsive and 

## drawn to behavior that gets attention – especially in 

## social media. 

## Some social media challenges, like the ALS ice bucket 

## challenge or the mannequin challenge, can be fun and 

## positive activities. But other challenges that pop up on 

## the internet are dangerous and can lead to permanent 

## harm. 

## You may have heard of social media trends like the Tide 

## pod challenge, the choking game (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4839780/) or "blackout" challenge, 

## the cinnamon challenge or the salt and ice challenge. Then there's the Benadryl challenge and another that involves 

## cooking chicken in NyQuil (the Sleepy Chicken challenge), which prompted the U.S. Food & Drug Administration to 

## warn (https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/recipe-danger-social-media-challenges-involving

## medicines) against the dangers of medicine misuse. 

## Why are teens susceptible to social media challenges? 

## Teens’ brains (/English/ages-stages/teen/Pages/Whats-Going-On-in-the-Teenage-Brain.aspx) are still developing. The 

## part of the brain that handles rational thought, the prefontal cortex, is not fully developed until the mid-20s. This 

## means teens are naturally more impulsive and likely to act before thinking through all of the ramifications. 

## The role of social media 

## Social media rewards outrageous behavior, and the more outrageous, the bigger the bragging rights. It’s a quick 

## moving, impulsive environment, and the fear of losing out is real for teens. That environment plays into a teen’s 

## underdeveloped ability to think through their actions and possible consequences. 

## Kids won’t necessarily stop to consider that laundry detergent (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/Laundry

## Room-and-Detergent-Safety.aspx) is a poison that can burn their throats and damage their airways. Or that misusing 

## (https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-warns-about-serious-problems-high-doses-allergy

## medicine-diphenhydramine-benadryl) medications like diphenhydramine (/English/safety-prevention/at

## home/medication-safety/Pages/Diphenhydramine-Benadryl-Antihistamine.aspx) (Benadryl) and similar medicines 

## can cause serious heart problems, seizures and coma. What they will focus on is that a popular kid in class did this and 

## got hundreds of likes and comments. 

## The role of parents – building a better brain 

## As a parent, you can help your teen build intellectual muscle. Here’s how: 

## 1. To start a conversation, ask your kids about the biggest challenges they’ve heard about in their circle of friends. 

## Encourage them to see if they can surprise you. Ask them (calmly and without judgment) what they think about 

## the challenge. This helps build the skill of judging risk by talking about what could happen to someone who takes 

## These trendy online challenges can cause serious injuries and poisonings, and some can even be fatal. Being 

## aware of these challenges and understanding why they lure teens is important for all parents.

### the challenge. You can still exercise your parental options such as limiting contact with certain kids or making 

### specific activities off limits. 

### 2. If your child mention an interest in participating in a challenge, use open-ended questions to encourage them to 

### think through each step of the challenge. Ask them to consider the worst outcome. Ask them to think about why 

### they would do it, and if it’s worth it. Are likes and comments worth hours in the emergency department? 

### 3. Be sure to "friend" your kids on social media. Staying in touch on their preferred communication platforms can 

### help you keep in touch with what goes on in their day-to-day lives. Watch their stories for clues about what is 

### going on in school and with their friends. Let your children know that if you pay for the device and the wireless 

### network, they have to friend you in exchange. 

### 4. Sometimes kids are more willing to talk about their peers than themselves. Asking questions about school 

### trends, friends and fads may yield more answers than direct questions about their own activities. No matter what, 

### it is important to keep the lines of communication open and avoid passing judgment. Instead, calmly discuss the 

### dangers in those choices. 

### While children and teens continue to grow, learn more about life, friends, and their place in the world, remember that 

### their brains are still rapidly developing. As a parent, you can help nurture that growth and help your teens develop 

### thoughtful, rational thinking skills that will continue to be important years to come.
