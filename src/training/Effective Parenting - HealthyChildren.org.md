# Effective Parenting 

## Now that our children are getting older, how do we know if we are 

## doing a good job as parents? 

## There is a whole history to your parent-child relationship that began at the moment your youngster was born. To help 

## you better understand the present, try to gain some insights into where you have been as a family. Think back on your 

## experiences with your child when he was a baby, a toddler, and a preschooler. Ask yourself: 

## How active a parent were you in those early years? Did you play a major child-raising role in the family, or were 

## there other demands (such as long hours at work) that kept you from being as involved as you would have liked? 

## What were your most enjoyable parenting and family experiences during those years? 

## Since those first years of your child's life, your parenting techniques may have changed. Perhaps you were quite 

## anxious as a new parent but gained confidence as the months and years passed. Ask yourself questions like: 

## What have you learned as a parent? What were the hardest skills to learn? 

## What were your best traits as a parent of a young child? What were the areas in which you had the most 

## problems? For example, did you find it difficult to relate to your child before he started to talk? Was it difficult for 

## you to set limits when he entered toddlerhood? How did he respond to you in your parenting role? 

## What did you want to change about yourself as a parent as your child grew? How successful have you been in 

## making those changes? Keep in mind that as your child grows, you and the entire family need to change too. In 

## essence, you are proceeding through your own development as a parent. 

## Even if you made mistakes during those early years, you can amend them now. If you missed out on certain family 

## experiences because you were working too hard, you still have many years to enjoy your spouse and children. In 

## general, children are understanding and forgive their parents for shortcomings and faults. And if you weren't there 

## when your child took his first steps or rode his tricycle for the first time, you can be there for other special events to 

## come, like your child's school play and his soccer games. 

## Your Current Parenting Experiences 

## Spend some time thinking about how you are doing as a parent during these middle years of your youngster's 

## childhood. This is a challenging time, in which your child is seeking more independence and is questioning the 

## family's rules. And, from time to time, you may have to help him with school-related problems. He will be developing 

## more peer relationships, too, and his interactions with siblings may change. 

## How well are you parenting your child during this time in his life? In what areas are you doing well? Where do you 

## think you need more help? 

## Your Current Life Issues 

## For many men and women, the stress in their lives interferes with their ability to parent. If they are unhappy on the 

## job, for instance, they might return home preoccupied and tense at the end of the day and be unable to handle the 

## tasks of running a family as effectively. 

## Take a moment to assess how you feel about these and other important aspects of your life. 

## Your career and occupation 

## Your relationships at work 

## Your living conditions, including your home and neighborhood 

## Your lifestyle, including time for yourself and leisure activities 

## Aging: growing older, slowing down and experiencing changes in your body 

## Your relationship with your spouse or partner 

## Your relationship with your parents and siblings

## Your friendships 

## Evaluate problems in these areas, and how they might be influencing your family life. Whenever possible, find ways to 

## deal with these difficulties in your life more effectively, so they will not interfere with your parent-child relationships. 

## For example, if you are like many parents, your day is so filled with job and family responsibilities that you have 

## absolutely no "down time," when you become a priority. Keep in mind, however, that most parents are happier people 

## (and thus better parents) when they make time for things they find pleasurable. As your children move through their 

## school years, they will develop interests and responsibilities (from friends to homework) that can provide you with 

## more time for those activities that you find enriching. You do not need to devote every free moment to playing 

## checkers or baseball with your children; in fact, as long as you are also setting aside some time for your youngsters, 

## they will probably feel good knowing that you are pursuing interests that you really enjoy.
