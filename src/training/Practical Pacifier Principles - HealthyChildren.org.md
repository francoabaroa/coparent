# Practical Pacifier Principles 

## Pacifiers have proven themselves to be yet one more source of parenting controversy. 

## Breastfeeding purists say stick to your guns and keep them out of your newborn’s mouth—even 

## when your baby is not yet able to use his own fingers as an alternative. (We would note that if and 

## when your baby is able to find his own fingers, it’s OK to let him continue using them as natural 

## pacifiers.) Others forewarn that pacifiers are simply a bad habit waiting to happen. Well fear not, 

## as long as you understand a few practical pacifier principles and pitfalls. In fact, pacifiers have, in 

## recent years, earned the status of a valuable ally in the fight against sudden infant death 

## syndrome. Whether you choose to breastfeed or bottle-feed, or a combination of both, here are 

## some tips for if and when you decide to give your baby a pacifier. 

## Soothing through sucking. Pacifiers can be invaluable in soothing babies as well as satisfying those who want to 

## suck all the time. You need not worry about your baby developing a lifelong dependency on them. Just be very 

## careful not to offer your newborn a pacifier at times when he really should be fed instead because pacifiers can 

## inappropriately pacify hungry babies as well as those who are looking for comfort. 

## Picking out the perfect pacifier. These days, picking the perfect pacifier may seem like a considerable task, 

## given all of the various brands and styles on the market. To the best of our knowledge, there’s no correlation 

## between price or marketing strategy and effectiveness, so we simply recommend trying one out and seeing if 

## your baby likes it. 

## If at first you don’t succeed. When you first offer your baby a pacifier, don’t be surprised if he seems 

## uninterested, gets downright angry, or spits it out even when you know he’s not hungry and just wants comfort. 

## For breastfed babies, sucking on a pacifier inherently requires a different technique, and one that may take a few 

## tries. For breastfed and bottlefed babies alike, a nipple that does not provide milk may not be quickly welcomed. 

## As you offer your baby a pacifier, try lightly stroking just to the side of his mouth and then gently holding the 

## pacifier in his mouth for a moment as he starts sucking to keep it from popping right back out. 

## A practical pacifier substitute. The cheap, easy, and ever-present pacifier substitute: your pinky finger. If you 

## find yourself in the position of wanting to soothe your baby by giving him something to suck on other than your 

## breast, you can always use your (clean) little finger. Simply turn your hand palm-side up and let your baby suck 

## on your pinky finger, allowing it to rest gently in the roof of his mouth. As a word of caution for anyone with 

## longer fingernails than ours—you may want to rethink how much you value your long nails, or at least the one on 

## your little finger. You may find that it’s a small sacrifice to make to clip it shorter for the sake of having a 

## contented baby. Some babies will learn to find their own fingers to suck on earlier than others, so do your best to 

## make sure those fingers are clean (and have clipped nails too!) 

## Passing on pacifiers. If your baby just isn’t that much of a “sucker,” he may not need to be soothed by sucking 

## on a pacifier at all. Just be thankful that there’s one less thing to keep track of during the day, and just consider 

## offering one as he is falling asleep.
