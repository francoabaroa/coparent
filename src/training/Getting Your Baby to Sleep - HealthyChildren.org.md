# Getting Your Baby to Sleep 

## Babies do not have regular sleep cycles until about 4 

## months of age. Although newborns sleep about 16 to 17 

## hours per day, they may only sleep 1 or 2 hours at a time. 

## As babies get older, they need less sleep (/English/ages

## stages/baby/sleep/Pages/default.aspx). However, 

## different babies have different sleep needs. 

## Here are some tips that may help your baby (and 

## you) sleep better at night. 

## All babies 

## Stay calm & quiet at night. Try not to stimulate or 

## wake babies when you feed or change them during the night. If you speak, speak softly. 

## Make daytime playtime. Keep babies awake longer during the day. This helps babies sleep for longer periods 

## during the night. Spend time talking, reading, and playing together. 

## Babies 4 months and older 

## Put babies to bed when they are drowsy. Do not wait until babies are asleep. This helps babies learn to fall asleep on 

## their own, in their own bed. If you hold babies or rock them to sleep, they may struggle to go back to sleep if they wake 

## up during the night. Remember to place babies on their back to sleep for every sleep until they are 1 year of age. Visit 

## http://www.HealthyChildren.org/safesleep (/safesleep) to learn more about how to create a safe sleeping environment for 

## babies. 

## Do not rush in to soothe a crying baby. Babies need time to put themselves back to sleep, and they need to learn how 

## to fall back asleep (/English/ages-stages/baby/crying-colic/Pages/Self-Soothing-Helping-Your-Baby-Learn-This-Life

## Skill.aspx)on their own. It is normal for a 6-month-old to wake up during the night and then go back to sleep after a 

## few minutes. Of course, you can attend to them—like feeding them, changing a soiled diaper, or comforting them if 

## they are sick—if needed.
