## Question 

# How should we feed our baby if weâ€™re running low on

## Answer 

## Lost jobs and business during the COVID-19 

## (/English/health-issues/conditions/chest

## lungs/Pages/2019-Novel-Coronavirus.aspx) outbreak has 

## left many families struggling to pay for groceries, 

## including infant formula. Food pantries and public 

## support programs such as WIC and SNAP 

## (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Babys-First-1000

## Days-AAP-Policy-Explained.aspx) are available, but may 

## not cover everything a family needs to stay healthy. Also, 

## families who find themselves suddenly in need may not 

## qualify for some of these public support programs. 

## The AAP strongly believes that good nutrition is essential for a healthy future for infants and small children. 

## Putting their needs first is critical, and there are ways to make this more affordable. 

## Here are some tips to help families struggling to afford infant formula: 

## If your child is younger than 12 months of age, ask your pediatrician's office if they can urgently get you a small 

## supply from the local formula representatives or a local charity. Some formula companies have patient 

## assistance programs that your pediatrician can help you find. Your local WIC office (http://signupwic.com/) may 

## also be able to help. 

## If possible, buy formula online or in the largest sizes available at retail stores, and watch for sales. Remember to 

## only buy formula from well-recognized distributors and pharmacies. Avoid formula sold by individuals or on 

## auction sites. 

## For most babies, it is OK to switch between different milk-based formulas, including store brands, unless your 

## baby is on a specific, highly hydrolyzed one such as Alimentum or Nutramigen. If you are unsure, talk with your 

## pediatrician. 

## Never water down (/English/ages-stages/baby/formula-feeding/Pages/how-to-safely-prepare-formula-with

## water.aspx) formula! Always follow label instructions or those given to you by your pediatrician. Watering down 

## formula is dangerous and can cause nutritional imbalances in your baby and lead to serious health problems. 


## Can I give my baby alternative milk products if I can't afford infant f 

## ormula? 

#### Whole cow's milk and dairy alternatives are not recommended for infants under 12 months of age. It is best to 

#### stick to breast milk and/or infant formula throughout your baby's first year, except in a very brief emergency. Food 

#### banks, local WIC offices, and other community resources are usually able to help in a food emergency. Keep in mind 

#### that eligibility for public support programs like WIC and SNAP may change, so keep in contact with these agencies to 

#### make sure you can participate. 

#### Toddler formulas are not necessary for infants over 12 months of age. Cow's milk or fortified soy milk products 

#### are less expensive than formula, meet a toddler's need for milk products, and provide adequate minerals and protein. 

## Can I make my baby's food myself? 

#### The AAP strongly advises against homemade formula (/English/ages-stages/baby/formula-feeding/Pages/Is

#### Homemade-Baby-Formula-Safe.aspx). Although recipes for homemade formulas circulating on the internet may 

#### seem healthy and less expensive, they may not be safe and do not meet your baby's nutritional needs. 

#### However, you can make your own baby food when you start your baby on solids (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding

#### nutrition/Pages/Starting-Solid-Foods.aspx), at about 6 months of age. There is no need to rely upon pre-made baby 

#### food that may be more expensive. If you make your own baby food (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding

#### nutrition/Pages/Tips-for-Introducing-Solid-Foods.aspx), be sure you include enough protein (/English/healthy

#### living/nutrition/Pages/Beyond-Chicken-Nuggets.aspx) and iron, two key nutrients for your child's growth. Also do not 

#### give honey (/English/health-issues/conditions/infections/Pages/Botulism.aspx) to an infant under 1 year of age and 

#### avoid foods that are choking hazards (/English/health-issues/injuries-emergencies/Pages/Choking-Prevention.aspx). 

## Remember 

#### Your pediatrician cares about your child's health and is available even during the COVID-19 outbreak. Always feel free 

#### to talk with your pediatrician about any concerns you have with feeding your baby.
