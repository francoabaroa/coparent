# Infantile Hemangiomas: About Strawberry Baby 

# Birthmarks 

## Hemangiomas are clusters of extra blood vessels on a baby's skin. 

## They may be there when a baby is born, or form within a few weeks 

## or months of birth. Some may look like rubbery, bumpy red 

## "strawberry" patches while others resemble deep bruises. Seeing a 

## hemangioma develop can be worrisome for new parents. 

## The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines 

## (http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2018 

## -3475) say it's important to identify and begin monitoring 

## infantile hemangiomas right after they appear―when they 

## tend to change most quickly. 

## While hemangiomas can vary a lot in size, appearance, and 

## placement, they are universally benign (non-cancerous). Most will go away on their own without causing any 

## problems. Some hemangiomas―particularly those on the face or those that are very large―need treatment early to 

## prevent them from interfering with body functions or causing permanent scars. Thankfully, there are excellent 

## treatments available today to can prevent these problems if treated early on. 

## About Infantile Hemangiomas: 

## Infantile hemangiomas appear after a baby is born, typically within a month. Roughly 4% to 5% of all infants get them, 

## although they are more common in Caucasians, girls, twins, and preterm or low-birth-weight babies. Infantile 

## hemangiomas typically go through a period of rapid growth, followed by more gradual fading and flattening. 

## There are different types of infantile hemangiomas: 

## Superficial hemangiomas have been called "strawberry marks," because they can resemble the surface of 

## berries. They may begin as small white, pink, or red areas on the skin that quickly change into brighter red, 

## raised lesions. Superficial hemangiomas may be focused in one spot or spread out over a larger area. 

## Deep hemangiomas have a smooth surface and form under the skin. They may have a bluish tint and resemble 

## bruises. Some cause the skin to look swollen. 

## Mixed hemangiomas are a combination of superficial and deep growths. 

## Are there other birthmarks like it? 

## Some of the other marks that can show up on a baby's skin include port wine stains (/English/ages

## stages/baby/bathing-skin-care/Pages/Your-Newborns-Skin-Birthmarks-and-Rashes.aspx) and "stork bites 

## (/English/ages-stages/baby/bathing-skin-care/Pages/Your-Newborns-Skin-Birthmarks-and-Rashes.aspx)." These also 


#### are caused when more blood than usual floods the capillaries under the skin. Port wine stains turn a reddish-purple 

#### and are often permanent; like hemangiomas, stork bites usually disappear, but can remain if they're on the back of the 

#### neck. 

## What to do if you think your baby has an infantile hemangioma: 

#### Infantile hemangiomas usually become noticeable by 4 weeks of age. They may start out looking like a tiny bump or 

#### scratch. But many then grow especially fast between 5 and 7 weeks old. If you think your baby might have a 

#### hemangioma, it's best to contact your baby's pediatrician right away. He or she probably will want to see your 

#### baby within a short timeframe. According to the AAP, the best "window of opportunity" to be evaluated and start 

#### treatment if needed is about 1 month of age. 

### Your pediatrician will want to know: 

#### Size: Is the hemangioma small (3/4" or less across) or larger? 

#### Location: Is it located on the face or in the diaper area, or in a different area? 

#### Number: Is there one or more than one? If more than one, how many? 

#### If your doctor can't see you in the office right away, they may ask you to send photos or recommend a telemedicine 

#### (/English/tips-tools/ask-the-pediatrician/Pages/Can-video-visits-be-good-for-my-child.aspx) visit to have a look 

#### without delay. 

## What to expect next: 

#### It's important to continue monitoring the hemangioma until it stops growing. Superficial hemangiomas typically 

#### reach their full size by 5 months of age, although deep hemangiomas sometimes keep growing a while longer. In 

#### some cases, your pediatrician may give a referral to an infantile hemangioma specialist with expertise in pediatric 

#### dermatology (/English/family-life/health-management/pediatric-specialists/Pages/What-is-a-Pediatric

#### Dermatologist.aspx), hematology-oncology, otolaryngology, or plastic surgery (/English/family-life/health

#### management/pediatric-specialists/Pages/What-is-a-Pediatric-Plastic-Surgeon.aspx). 

#### By the time a baby is 6-18 months old, most hemangiomas begin to slowly improve. In a process called "involution," the 

#### hemangioma will become less red and more grey or whitish and gradually flatten and shrink from the center outward. 

#### Each case is different. Most hemangiomas have finished or almost finished flattening and shrinking by 4 to 5 

#### years of age. 

## When does a hemangioma need to be treated? 

#### Whether a hemangioma needs treatment depends on the age of the baby, where the hemangioma is located and how 

#### fast it is growing, whether it becomes sore or scabby, and the risk of it causing medical complications with a child's 

#### health and well-being. 

### There are 3 main reasons for treatment: 

#### Medical problems. In rare cases and depending where they are located and how fast they are growing, 

#### hemangioma may begin to interfere with vital functions. Hemangiomas near the child's eyes, nose or mouth, for 

#### example, can affect the child's ability to see, eat, breath or hear well. In rare cases, hemangiomas grow inside the 

#### body, which may need to be monitored with imaging tests (/English/health

#### issues/conditions/treatments/Pages/Imaging-Tests.aspx). 

#### Skin breakdown. Sometimes, skin on the hemangioma's surface breaks down and becomes an open sore (called 

#### an ulcer) that could lead to bleeding, infection, or scarring. 

#### Permanent skin changes. Changes in the skin's texture or color can remain even after the hemangioma has 

#### gone away. This can be a concern, especially for hemangiomas on the child's face. Large hemangiomas on facial 

#### features such as the nose or lip can also distort growth.

## What kinds of treatments are available for hemangiomas? 

#### If a baby's hemangioma risks causing problems, medications can be applied directly to the skin or taken by mouth. 

#### The goal is to keep them from getting any bigger during their period of rapid growth, or to make them shrink more 

#### quickly. Laser procedures or surgery may be an option in some cases, although it generally is avoided during early 

#### infancy to avoid increased anesthesia risks. 

### Systemic treatments 

#### Propranolol , a beta blocker medication used for many years to treat high blood pressure, is now commonly 

#### given by mouth as an effective treatment for problem hemangiomas. To avoid a growth rebound, the pediatrician 

#### may recommend therapy continue until your child's first birthday. The drug must be used with close observation 

#### by your healthcare provider to watch for possible side effects and complications. 

#### Oral steroids have been largely replaced by safer and more effective options, but are still used in select cases, 

#### determined by the healthcare provider. 

### Localized treatments 

#### Topical medications applied directly on the skin may be used for small, superficial hemangiomas. Prescription 

#### creams or ointments containing beta-blockers are the most effective topical treatment option to help stop 

#### growth and sometimes shrink and fade hemangiomas. In some cases, steroid creams may be prescribed for 

#### smaller, thinner hemangiomas. 

#### Steroid injections can be given directly into the hemangioma to help slow its growth. This works best for 

#### smaller, localized hemangiomas. 

### Other treatments 

#### Surgery is usually only considered for smaller hemangiomas in areas where they may cause problems, or for 

#### small hemangiomas with broken skin. Because surgery will always leave a scar itself--and because most 

#### hemangiomas get better with time--early surgery is only recommended for a small minority of cases. Surgery 

#### can also repair extra skin or scars left by a hemangioma, but usually is delayed until a child is between 3 and 5 

#### years old. 

#### Laser treatment may be helpful in some cases to stop bleeding or to help heal hemangiomas with open sores 

#### (ulcers). They can also help to remove some of the redness or texture changes that may be left behind after the 

#### hemangioma improves. 

## Remember: 

#### Contact your pediatrician if you notice anything developing on your baby's skin. Your baby's first few well-child visits 

#### (/English/family-life/health-management/Pages/Well-Child-Care-A-Check-Up-for-Success.aspx) are also a great time 

#### to bring it up. Few hemangiomas cause any trouble, and most go away on their own. But prompt evaluation, 

#### monitoring and treatment, when needed, can help ensure problem hemangiomas have as little impact as possible on 

#### your child.
