# Cognitive and Verbal Skills Needed for Toilet Training 

## If you know how to drive a car with a manual transmission, you probably remember how hard it 

## was to master this skill. First, you had to locate the stick shift, the clutch pedal, and the gears. Next, 

## you had to get a feel for when it was time to shift gears, and learn how to do so smoothly while 

## easing the clutch pedal down and up again. 

## During the toilet-training process, your child must learn to coordinate an equally complex 

## combination of physical and cognitive tasks. She must familiarize herself with the necessary 

## “equipment” (her body and its functions), associate physical sensations with the proper 

## responses, picture what she wants to do (use the potty), create a plan to get there, begin using it, 

## and remain in place long enough to finish, which requires both memory and concentration. Throughout this learning 

## process, she must be able to understand your explanations, commands, and responses to some extent, and express her 

## own feelings about toilet use. 

## Body Awareness 

## Clearly, all of this learning takes time. The first steps in this process involve bodily sensation—the ability to associate 

## an inner feeling of fullness with the bowel movement or urination that results—and usually take place at around 

## twelve to eighteen months. Your efforts to reinforce this awareness by remarking on the poop or pee to come are 

## among the first productive actions you can take to start your child thinking about potty use. 

## As time passes, your child may demonstrate discomfort over a dirty diaper, try to remove her diaper or resist being 

## diapered, and otherwise show that her awareness of her physical state is expanding. She may start to enjoy (and even 

## insist on) spending a substantial amount of time without clothes on, and by age two will have become quite interested 

## in all of her body parts, especially the “private” ones used to eliminate. This is the age when boys commonly begin to 

## talk about their penis, or comment on Dad’s, while girls start to explore and ask questions about the vagina and its 

## uses. Such interest in the body indicates a new openness to your explanations of how the body works and a desire to 

## “name the equipment.” Acquiring simple words to describe her body and its workings helps your child think more 

## fully about the process of elimination. It also sets the stage for learning through experience. Just letting her sit on the 

## potty until she happens to have a bowel movement—and then hearing you say how pleased you are by what she did— 

## is likely to help your child connect the need to poop with potty use more effectively than any long-winded 

## explanation. 

## Making Plans and Carrying Them Out 

## Understanding the link between needing to eliminate and doing so is an important first step in toilet training 

## readiness. Still, more development is necessary before your child can begin picturing the potty when she needs to 

## go, plan how she will get to the bathroom and urinate into the potty, and remember her plan long enough to carry it 

## out. These next steps in the developmental process require the capacity for picturing actions (symbolic thought), 

## planning (problem solving), and memory—abilities that begin to surface at age one but become much better 

## established by age two or even later. 

## One of the first signs that your child is able to think of an object when it isn’t there, for example, is at around twelve 

## months, when she begins to wail every time you leave the room. For the first time, she can picture you and know that 

## you continue to exist even though she can’t get to you, and it is the frustration caused by this understanding that 

## makes her cry. In the coming months, her brain will develop to the point where she realizes she can crawl or toddle to 

## the next room to find you—and walk to the bathroom to find her potty. 

## By age two, she may routinely picture her potty when she needs to use the bathroom. She may even know how to find 

## the potty when she wants to. She may still need your support, however, in making the associations required to decide 

## to go to the potty when she feels the urge and accomplishing her mission before other thoughts or events distract her. 

## By age two and a half or three, your child’s evolving interest in problem solving will support her ability to accomplish 

## this series of actions on her own. Solving problems requires picturing a solution and planning a way to achieve it, and 

## seeing these skills develop is perhaps one of the most pleasurable ways of noting that your child is approaching toilet

### training readiness. As your child moves from her second to her third birthday, you will be able to observe her solving 

### problems over and over, all day long—from how to get her toy shovel back from another child in the sandbox to how to 

### get you to give her an extra piece of candy after dinner. The sight of your child’s pensive face, pondering how she will 

### obtain the current object of her desire, is a sure sign that she is also cognitively mature enough to figure out how to 

### solve the problem of staying dry without diapers (go to the bathroom and sit on the potty—now!). 

## More-Complex Thinking 

### A number of other cognitive developments greatly facilitate your child’s ability to use the potty successfully 

### beginning at around age two and a half or three. Her memory will have improved a great deal, enabling her not only to 

### remember where she is headed when she starts toward the bathroom but to recall previous toilet-training 

### experiences and benefit from them. Her imagination has expanded, allowing her to explore potty use through 

### imaginary play with stuffed animals, dolls, and puppets. (An expanded imagination may also create new problems in 

### toilet training, leading to such anxieties as the fear of a flushing toilet or the fear of being flushed away.) 

### By age three she will have grown somewhat better at interrupting her focus on another task to go to the bathroom and 

### resist distraction on the way. Chances are she will have achieved the verbal sophistication necessary, too, to 

### communicate any problems or confusion she is experiencing, to express any fears that may have developed, and to ask 

### for adults’ help and guidance when she needs it. 

### These essential cognitive and verbal developments, just as important to toilet training success as physiological 

### growth, are the reason why most parents find that waiting until age two and a half or three to begin training usually 

### makes the process much easier. Particularly if you have begun laying the groundwork at an earlier age, waiting for 

### your child’s natural development to fall into place can be a wise decision.
