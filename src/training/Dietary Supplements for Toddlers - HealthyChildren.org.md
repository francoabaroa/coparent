# Dietary Supplements for Toddlers 

## If you provide your child with selections from each of the basic food 

## groups (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/The-5-Food

## Groups-Sample-Choices.aspx) and let your child experiment with a 

## wide variety of tastes, colors, and textures, he or she should be 

## eating a balanced diet with plenty of vitamins. Some vitamins, such 

## as the fat-soluble vitamins (A and D), may even pose risks; they're 

## stored in the tissues when consumed in excess, and at very high 

## levels could make your child sick. High doses of minerals such 

## as zinc (/English/ages-stages/teen/nutrition/Pages/Zinc-Good-For

## Growth.aspx) and iron taken over an extended time can have 

## negative effects, as well. 

## Supplementation for Some Children 

## For some children, however, supplementation may be important. Your child may need some vitamin and/or mineral 

## supplementation if your family's dietary practices limit the food groups available to him or her. For example, if your 

## household is vegan—a type of strict vegetarian (/English/ages-stages/teen/nutrition/Pages/What-Makes-A

## Vegetarian.aspx) diet including no animal products such as eggs or dairy foods—the American Academy of Pediatrics 

## (AAP) recommends that your child only be on this diet after consultation with your pediatrician or health care 

## provider. It is possible to have a child on a safe vegan diet, but it should be done carefully. There are critical vitamins 

## and minerals which can be deficient in a vegan diet, particularly vitamin B12, vitamin D, iron, vitamin A, calcium, zinc, 

## and riboflavin. 

## Childhood is a critical time for growth and brain development, so particular vitamins and supplements may be 

## recommended. Rickets (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Vitamin-D-Deficiency-and-Rickets.aspx), for 

## example, is a disease in which the bones soften, and it is associated with inadequate vitamin D (/English/healthy

## living/nutrition/Pages/Vitamin-D-On-the-Double.aspx) intake and decreased exposure to sunlight; although 

## uncommon in the United States, it continues to be reported—especially in children with darker-pigmented skin. 

## Consult your pediatrician about which supplements are needed and the amounts. 

## Iron Deficiency 

## Iron deficiency does occur among some young children and can lead to anemia (/English/health

## issues/conditions/chronic/Pages/Anemia-and-Your-Child.aspx)—a condition that limits the ability of the blood to 

## carry oxygen. In some cases, the problem is dietary. Toddlers need to receive at least 15 milligrams of iron a day in 

## their food, but many fail to do so. 

## Drinking large quantities of milk may lead to iron deficiency anemia, as the child will be less interested in other foods, 

## some of which are potential sources of iron. 

## Too Much Milk? 

## If your child is drinking 24 to 32 ounces (720–960 mL) of milk or less each day, there's little cause for concern. If he or 

## she drinks much more than that and you can't get her to eat more iron-rich foods, consult your pediatrician about 

## adding an iron supplement (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Vitamin-Iron-Supplements.aspx) to 

## his or her diet. In the meantime, continue to give vitamin D drops (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding

## nutrition/Pages/Vitamin-Iron-Supplements.aspx) (600 IU per day after age one) if taking less than 32 ounces of milk 

## per day, and keep offering a wide variety of iron-rich foods so that, eventually, supplementation won't be necessary.
