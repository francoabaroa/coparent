# Social Development: 1 Year Olds 

## During his second year, your toddler will develop a very specific image of his social world, friends, 

## and acquaintances. He is at its center, and while you may be close at hand, he is most concerned 

## about where things are in relation to himself. He knows that other people exist, and they vaguely 

## interest him, but he has no idea how they think or what they feel. As far as he’s concerned, 

## everyone thinks as he does. 

## As you can imagine, his view of the world (technically, some experts call it egocentric or self

## centered) often makes it difficult for him to play with other children in a truly social sense. He’ll 

## play alongside and compete for toys, but he doesn’t play cooperative games easily. He’ll enjoy 

## watching and being around other children, especially if they’re slightly older. He may imitate them or treat them the 

## way he does dolls, for example, trying to brush their hair, but he’s usually surprised and resists when they try to do the 

## same thing to him. He may offer them toys or things to eat but may get upset if they respond by taking what he’s 

## offered them. 

## Sharing is a meaningless term to a child this age. Every toddler believes that he alone deserves the spotlight. 

## Unfortunately, most are also as assertive as they are self centered, and competition for toys and attention frequently 

## erupts into hitting and tears. How can you minimize the combat when your child’s “friends” are over? Try providing 

## plenty of toys for everyone and be prepared to referee. 

## As we’ve suggested earlier, your child also may start to show possessiveness over toys that he knows belong to him. 

## If another child even touches the plaything, he may rush over and snatch it away. Try reassuring him that the other 

## child is “only looking at it” and that “it’s okay for him to have a turn with it.” But also acknowledge that “Yes, it’s your 

## toy, and he’s not going to take it away from you.” It may help to select a couple of particularly prized items and make 

## them off limits to everyone else. Sometimes this helps toddlers feel they have some control over their world and 

## makes them less possessive about other belongings. 

## Because children this age have so little awareness of the feelings of others, they can be very physical in their 

## responses to the children around them. Even when just exploring or showing affection, they may poke each other’s 

## eyes or pat a little too hard. (The same is true of their treatment of animals.) When they’re upset, they can hit or slap 

## without realizing they are hurting the other child. For this reason, be alert whenever your toddler is among playmates, 

## and pull him back as soon as this physical aggressiveness occurs. Tell him, “Don’t hit,” and redirect all the children to 

## friendlier play. 

## Fortunately, your toddler will show his self-awareness in less aggressive ways, as well. By eighteen months, he’ll be 

## able to say his own name. At about the same time, he’ll identify his reflection in the mirror and start showing a greater 

## interest in caring for himself. As he approaches age two, he may be able to brush his teeth and wash his hands if shown 

## how to do it. He’ll also help dress and, especially, undress himself. Many times a day you may find him busily removing 

## his shoes and socks even in the middle of a store or the park. 

## Because your toddler is a great imitator, he will be learning important social skills from the way you handle conflicts 

## between the two of you. Model for him the way words and listening can, at least on occasion, be used to resolve 

## conflicts (“I know you want to get down and walk, but you must hold my hand so I know you’re safe”). As an imitator, 

## he also will eagerly participate in anything you’re doing around the house. Whether you’re reading the paper, 

## sweeping the floors, mowing the lawn, or making dinner, he’ll want to “help.” Even though it may take longer with him 

## doing so, try to turn it into a game. If you’re doing something he can’t help with because it’s dangerous or you’re in a 

## hurry, look for another “chore” he can do. By all means, don’t discourage these wonderful impulses to be helpful. 

## Helping, like sharing, is a vital social skill, and the sooner he develops it, the more pleasant life will be for everyone.
