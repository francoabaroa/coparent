# Choose This, Not That: Healthy & Unhealthy Choices at 

# Fast Food Restaurants 

## It can be challenging to make healthy choices when eating out. 

## Parents can limit trips to fast food restaurants by planning ahead 

## and having healthy choices (/English/ages

## stages/gradeschool/nutrition/Pages/Making-Healthy-Food

## Choices.aspx) available at home, or to packing snacks 

## (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Choosing-Healthy

## Snacks-for-Children.aspx) or meals for when away from home. 

## Tips for Eating at a Fast Food 

## Restaurant: 

## Before you go, look at the menu online and plan the meal. Look for items lower in saturated fat, sodium, added 

## sugars, and calories. 

## Pay attention to portion sizes. Due to large portions (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Portions-and

## Serving-Sizes.aspx), one meal at a fast food restaurant may contain as many calories as a child needs for a whole 

## day. Decrease portion size by sharing your meal, putting half of your meal in a to go container for a later meal, 

## and/or resisting the urge to "clean your plate (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/The-Clean-Plate

## Club.aspx)." 

## Avoid sugary drinks. A large soda may contain 17 teaspoons of sugar and several hundred calories. Consider 

## water or unsweetened tea instead of soda, fruit punch, or a shake. 

## Choose items that are grilled or baked items over fried or breaded. 

## Go light on sauces like mayonnaise and ketchup which contain sugar, fat, and salt. 

## Skip the cheese. 

## Look for fruit, vegetable, and salad with low calorie dressing options. 

## Examples of Choosing Healthier Options: 

## Chicken fajita instead of a breaded chicken sandwich 

## Lean burger instead of an oversized special with lots of fat-laden trimmings 

## Baked potato, fruit or salad with low fat dressing or steamed vegetables instead of high-fat French fries 

## Main-course salad from the salad bar with low-calorie dressing (skip the bacon bits and croutons) 

## Nonfat frozen yogurt with a fresh fruit topping instead of an ice cream sundae or a large slice of pie 

## Pizza with whole grain crust topped with vegetables like tomato sauce, mushrooms, eggplant, and peppers 

## instead of high-fat toppings like sausage, pepperoni, and extra cheese 

## Low-fat milkshake or water instead of soda or a regular shake
