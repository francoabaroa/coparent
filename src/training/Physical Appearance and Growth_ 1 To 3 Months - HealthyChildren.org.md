# Physical Appearance and Growth: 1 To 3 Months 

## From months one through four, your baby will continue growing at the same rate he established 

## during his first few weeks of life. In general, babies gain between 1 1⁄2 and 2 pounds (0.7 to 0.9 kg) 

## and grow 1 to 1 1⁄2 inches (2.5 to 4 cm). Their head size will increase in circumference by about 

## 1⁄2 inch (1.25 cm) each month. These figures are only averages, however, so keep track of your 

## child’s development. 

## At two months, the soft spots on your baby’s head should still be open and flat, but by two to three 

## months, the soft spot at the back should be closed. Also, his head is more likely to be 

## proportionately larger as compared to his body because it is growing faster. This is quite normal; 

## his body will soon catch up. 

## At two months, your baby will look round and chubby, but as he starts using his arms and legs more actively, muscles 

## will develop. His bones also will grow rapidly, and as his arms and legs loosen up, his body and limbs will seem to 

## stretch out, making him appear taller and leaner.
