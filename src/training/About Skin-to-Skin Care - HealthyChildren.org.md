# About Skin-to-Skin Care 

## You may be able to hold your baby in the NICU as soon 

## as she is stable and before she is ready to begin 

## feedings. If so, you may be interested in skin-to-skin 

## care, also called kangaroo care. 

## What is Kangaroo Care? 

## Kangaroo care was developed in South America as a 

## way to keep premature infants warm so that they could 

## be released early from overcrowded hospitals. Mothers 

## were instructed to hold their diaper-clad premature 

## infants beneath their clothing, skin-to-skin, snuggled 

## between their warm breasts. 

## The surprising benefits of kangaroo care for the infant include: 

## Warmth 

## Stability of heartbeat and breathing 

## Increased time spent in the deep sleep and quiet alert states 

## Decreased crying 

## Increased weight gain 

## Increased breastfeeding (/english/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/default.aspx) 

## These benefits are apparent even when kangaroo care occurs for only a few minutes each day. 

## Dads Can Give Kangaroo Care, Too! 

## Both mothers and fathers can give kangaroo care. Most nurseries have comfortable rocking chairs and screens that 

## can be placed around your chair or the baby’s care area. Simply wear a layer of clothing that opens down the front, and 

## sit behind the screen or with your back to the room. Don’t bother to dress your baby or wrap her in a blanket—all she 

## needs is a diaper because she will stay warm next to your body. You may notice that your infant tolerates these holding 

## sessions much better when they are not preceded by undressing, diaper changing, temperature taking, dressing again, 

## and swaddling in blankets. Snuggle your baby upright on your chest, or lay your baby with her head against your 

## chest. 

## Kangaroo care is a nice way for you to get acquainted with your baby in the NICU (/English/ages

## stages/baby/preemie/pages/How-You-Can-Participate-in-the-Care-of-Your-Baby-in-the-NICU.aspx). The feeling of 

## your baby’s warm skin against yours is a special closeness and comfort for you both. At a time when so many people 

## are caring for your baby, kangaroo care provides special moments of belonging that only you can experience with 

## your baby. 

## After You Take Baby Home 

## After you take your baby home (/English/ages-stages/baby/preemie/pages/Bringing-Baby-Home-Preparing-Yourself

## Your-Home-and-Your-Family.aspx), find times to hold him right next to your skin during bottle feeding 

## (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Practical-Bottle-Feeding-Tips.aspx). For example, you can do it 

## after a bath (/English/ages-stages/baby/bathing-skin-care/pages/Bathing-Your-Newborn.aspx) or first thing in the 

## morning. Allow yourself and your baby the pleasure and the tactile stimulation of skin-to-skin contact during 

## feedings.
