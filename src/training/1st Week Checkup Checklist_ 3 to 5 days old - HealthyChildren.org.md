## Congratulations on the birth of your new baby! For many parents, the first visit to the pediatrician is also their

## to remember, and what to expect at your baby's first checkup. 

## Your Newborn | American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)Your Newborn | American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 

## ✅ What to bring 

## Hospital paperwork—including information about your baby's discharge weight or complications during pregnancy 

## or birth. 

## ✅ Immunizations 

## Your baby will receive the Hepatitis B (HBV) vaccine (/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Hepatitis-B

## receive their first dose of vaccine within the first 24 hours of birth.) 

## ✅ Screenings 

## Your pediatrician will review the results of two screenings that all babies receive in the hospital for hearing 

## (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Purpose-of-Newborn-Hearing-Screening.aspx) and blood (/English/ages

## stages/baby/Pages/jaundice.aspx). Based on the results, your pediatrician may rescreen or recommend a referral to a 

## specialist. 

## ✅Development & feeding 

## Your doctor will measure and weigh your baby to make sure their growth is on track, observe their development and 

## behavior, and perform a physical exam. 

## Questions your pediatrician may ask 

## Does your baby receive breast milk (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Why-Breastfeed.aspx), 

## iron-fortified formula, or a combination of the two? 

## If breastfeeding, do you have support from a lactation consultant? The first few weeks of breastfeeding can be an 

## adjustment, but try to stick with it (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Stick-with-Breastfeeding-Its

## Worth-It.aspx)! (The AAP recommends breastfeeding as the sole source of nutrition for your baby for about 6 


#### months. When you add solid foods (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Starting-Solid

#### Foods.aspx) to your baby's diet, continue breastfeeding until at least 12 months. You can continue to breastfeed 

#### after 12 months if you and your baby desire.) 

#### Is your breastfed baby getting a vitamin D supplement (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding

#### daily, beginning in the first few days of life.)
