# Diarrhea in Babies 

## Diarrhea isn't just a loose stool; it's a watery stool that occurs up to 

## 12 times a day. 

## If you're breastfeeding (/English/ages

## stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/default.aspx) : A breastfed 

## baby's stools are light yellow, soft, or even runny, and they 

## often contain small pieces that look like seeds. Breastfed 

## babies may pass stools with every breastfeeding. 

## If your baby is formula-fed (/English/ages

## stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/default.aspx) : Babies 

## who are formula-fed pass stools that are yellow to tan and 

## about as firm as peanut butter. 

## Whether you breastfeed or formula-feed your baby, as he grows it's normal for you to see stools less frequently. 

## A greenish tinge to the stools is normal. As long as your baby is feeding and growing normally, you should not be 

## concerned unless her stools are whitish and clay-like, watery and filled with mucus, or hard and dry. They should also 

## not be black or bloody. If they are, call your pediatrician. 

## Call Your Pediatrician Right Away If Your Baby has Diarrhea and 

## Is 3 months or younger 

## Has a rectal temperature (/English/health-issues/conditions/fever/Pages/Fever-and-Your-Baby.aspx) of 100.4°F 

## (38°C) or higher 

## Is vomiting (/English/health-issues/conditions/abdominal/Pages/Infant-Vomiting.aspx) 

## Lacks energy or is irritable and doesn't want to feed 

## Has signs of dehydration (/English/health-issues/injuries-emergencies/Pages/Dehydration.aspx), such as dry 

## mouth, or has not passed urine for 3 or more hours 

## WARNING! 

## A baby can become dehydrated quickly. If your baby is younger than 3 months and has a fever as well as diarrhea, call 

## your pediatrician at once. If your baby is older than 3 months and has had mild diarrhea with a slight fever for more 

## than a day, check whether he's passing a normal amount of urine. Also check his temperature with a thermometer. 

## Then call your pediatrician. 

## Coping with Diarrhea in Babies 

## A viral infection that causes vomiting and diarrhea may make your baby irritable for 1 or 2 days. If your baby is 

## otherwise healthy, symptoms should clear up on their own. Your pediatrician will advise giving fluids to your baby to 

## make up for the fluids and electrolytes (eg, sodium, potassium) lost with the diarrhea. 

## If you're breastfeeding: Your pediatrician will probably recommend that you keep breastfeeding as usual. 

## If your baby is formula-fed: Your pediatrician may instruct you to give your baby a special drink that contains 

## electrolytes and sugar. 

## Pharmacies carry premixed drinks with the right balance of electrolytes for newborns and young infants; homemade 

## solutions may not have the correct electrolyte balance and therefore should not be used.
