# Your Baby’s First 1,000 Days: AAP Policy Explained 

## By: Sarah Jane Schwarzenberg, MD, FAAP & Michael Georgieff, MD, FAAP 

## Did you know that children’s brains grow and change more in 

## the first 1,000 days of their lives – that is, from the time of 

## conception to their second birthdays – than at any other time? 

## The brain starts as a handful of microscopic cells. By 2 years of age, 

## the brain has developed into a complex organ that allows children 

## to learn to walk, talk, and read. And it’s ready for new changes and 

## experiences, like learning math, reasoning, and complex thought. 

## These brain changes are amazing, but they are also dependent on 

## each other. That means that if the brain lacks a necessary building 

## block during this time, it will miss out on the developmental process that building block was supposed to make. This is 

## why the first 1,000 days are so critical – and a great time to make sure your baby is off to a healthy start. 

## Food for Thought 

## Healthy eating (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/How-a-Healthy-Diet-Helps-You-Breastfeed.aspx) and 

## taking pre-natal vitamins are some of the best things a pregnant woman can do to keep her child’s brain healthy. 

## Once baby arrives, these are important for healthy brain development too: 

## Breastfeeding (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/default.aspx), which provides nutrients, growth 

## factors, and types of cells not found in infant formula. The AAP recommends exclusive breastfeeding until six 

## months of age if possible, and continuing after solids are introduced for at least the first year. 

## If you are not breastfeeding, give your baby an approved infant formula, which has the nutrients babies need in 

## the first 6 months of life to have healthy brain development. 

## Eating a variety of healthy foods (/english/healthy-living/nutrition/pages/default.aspx) is important. The brain 

## has wonderful potential, but it depends on the body getting all the nutritional building blocks it needs. In those 

## first 1,000 days, even before your child is born, it needs: 

## Calories (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Energy-In-Recommended-Food-Drink-Amounts-for

## Children.aspx) 

## Protein 

## Iron 

## Zinc 

## Choline 

## Folate 

## Iodine 

## Vitamins A, D, B6, B12 

## Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (the special fats found in breastmilk, fish, and some nuts)

## Your Pediatrician Can Help 

#### Pediatricians have many resources to help families make good nutrition choices for their child’s developing brain. 

#### The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has teams of expert pediatricians who write guidelines, such as Advocacy 

#### for Improving Nutrition in the First 1000 Days to Support Childhood Development and Adult Health 

#### (https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2017-3716), that cover a wide variety of nutrition topics. Your pediatrician may refer to 

#### these when helping you make decisions about your child’s care. 

#### And since healthy food for babies and toddlers can be expensive, your pediatrician may be able to connect you to 

#### programs in your community such as: 

#### The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC 

#### (https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/women-infants-and-children-wic)) 

#### The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP (https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/supplemental

#### nutrition-assistance-program-snap)) 

#### The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP (https://www.fns.usda.gov/cacfp/child-and-adult-care-food

#### program)) 

#### Food pantries and soup kitchens 

#### Maternal, infant, and early childhood home visiting program 

## It’s Scientific 

#### Scientists continue to study the role of healthy diets in children’s growth and development. The United States 

#### Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have called together 

#### groups of scientists to develop guidelines for feeding children between birth and 24 months of age, based on the best 

#### information we have from many years of study and investigation. This work is happening now and will take several 

### years to complete. Click here (https://www.cnpp.usda.gov/birthto24months) for more information on the Birth to 24 

### Months project. 

#### Healthy brain development is so important in giving our children a long, healthy, and productive life. You can work 

#### with your pediatrician to understand the best things to do to help your child get the nutrients he or she needs to keep 

#### development on track.
