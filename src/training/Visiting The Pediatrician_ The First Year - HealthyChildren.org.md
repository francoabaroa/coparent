# Visiting The Pediatrician: The First Year 

## Why does my baby need to see the pediatrician so often? 

## You probably will see more of your pediatrician (/English/tips-tools/find

## pediatrician/Pages/Pediatrician-Referral-Service.aspx) in your baby’s first year than at any other 

## time. The baby’s first examination will take place immediately after birth. Your pediatrician may 

## want to see your baby more often. 

## Ideally, both parents should attend these early visits to the doctor. These appointments give you 

## and your pediatrician a chance to get to know each other and exchange questions and answers. 

## Don’t restrict yourself to medical questions; your pediatrician is also an expert on general child care issues and a 

## valuable resource if you’re looking for child care help, parent support groups, or other outside assistance. Many 

## pediatricians hand out information sheets that cover the most common concerns, but it’s a good idea to make a list of 

## questions before each visit so you don’t forget any important ones. 

## If only one parent can attend, try to get a friend or a relative to join the parent who does. It’s much easier to 

## concentrate on your discussions with the doctor if you have a little help dressing and undressing the baby and 

## gathering all of her things. While you’re getting used to outings with your newborn, an extra adult also can help carry 

## the diaper bag and hold doors. Grandparents can fulfill this role quite well if they live nearby. The purpose of these 

## early checkups is to make sure your child is growing and developing properly and has no serious abnormalities. 

## Specifically, the doctor will check the following areas. 

## Growth. You will be asked to undress your baby, and then she’ll be weighed on an infant scale. Her length may be 

## measured lying on a flat table with her legs stretched straight. A special tape is used to measure the size of her head. 

## All of these measurements should be plotted on a graph in order to determine her growth curve from one visit to the 

## next. This is the most reliable way to judge whether she’s growing normally, and will show you her position on the 

## growth curve in relation to other children her age. 

## Head. The soft spots (fontanelles) should be open (normal skin-covered openings in the skull) and flat for the first few 

## months. By two to three months of age, the spot at the back should be closed. The front soft spot should close before 

## your child’s second birthday (around eighteen months of age). 

## Ears. The doctor will look inside both ears with an otoscope, an instrument that provides a view of the ear canal and 

## eardrum. This tells him whether there is any evidence of fluid or infection in the ear. You’ll also be asked if the child 

## responds normally to sounds. Formal hearing tests are done in the newborn nursery and later if there is suspicion that 

## a problem exists. 

## Eyes. The doctor will use a bright object or flashlight to catch your baby’s attention and track her eye movements. He 

## also may look inside the baby’s eyes with a lighted instrument called an ophthalmoscope—repeating the internal eye 

## examination that was first done in the hospital nursery. This is particularly helpful in detecting cataracts (clouding of 

## the lens of the eye). 

## Mouth. The mouth is checked for signs of infection and, later, for teething progress. 

## Heart and Lungs. The pediatrician will use a stethoscope on the front and back of the chest to listen to your child’s 

## heart and lungs. This examination determines whether there are any abnormal heart rhythms, sounds, or breathing 

## difficulties. 

## Abdomen. By placing his hand on the child’s abdomen and gently pressing, the doctor makes sure that none of the 

## organs are enlarged and there are no unusual masses or tenderness. 

## Genitalia. The genitalia are examined at each visit for any unusual lumps, tenderness, or signs of infection. In the first 

## exam or two, the doctor pays special attention to a circumcised boy’s penis to make sure it’s healing properly. 

## Pediatricians also check all baby boys to make certain both testes are down in the scrotum.

## Hips and Legs. The pediatrician will move your baby’s legs to check for problems with the hip joints. The movements 

## your pediatrician will perform with your baby’s legs are designed to detect dislocation or dysplasia of the hip joint. It is 

## important to look for this early in life as early detection can lead to proper referral and correction. Later, after the baby 

## starts to walk, the doctor will watch her take a few steps to make sure the legs and feet are properly aligned and move 

## normally. 

## Developmental Milestones. The pediatrician also will ask about the baby’s general development. Among other 

## things, he’ll observe and discuss when the baby starts to smile, roll over, sit up, and walk, and how she uses her hands 

## and arms. During the exam, the pediatrician will test reflexes and general muscle tone.
