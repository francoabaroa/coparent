# Birth Control and Breastfeeding 

## Once you have settled into life as a breastfeeding 

## mother, you will no doubt enjoy renewing your 

## relationship with your partner as well. One of the 

## welcome advantages of exclusive round-the-clock 

## breastfeeding (no water, juice, formula, solids or other 

## supplements for the baby) is that it significantly 

## reduces the chance of your becoming pregnant again 

## during the first six months because it delays the return 

## of your ovulation cycles. 

## Using contraceptives while breastfeeding 

## At about four to six weeks after giving birth, once your milk supply is firmly established, you may begin using 

## contraceptives. But be sure to discuss the issue with your baby's pediatrician and your gynecologist first. There are no 

## harmful effects on infants when the mother uses hormonal contraceptives, but their use may diminish milk supply 

## (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/low-breast-milk-supply.aspx), especially during the early weeks of 

## breastfeeding. This is especially true when hormonal contraception is combined with stressors such as a return to 

## work or less-frequent breastfeeding. Birth control pills with high doses of estrogen are more likely to decrease milk 

## supply. 

## IUDs, condoms, a diaphragm, or a cervical cap and spermicide may be considered as alternative choices for now (even 

## if somewhat less effective), since these forms of birth control are unlikely to interfere with your milk supply.
