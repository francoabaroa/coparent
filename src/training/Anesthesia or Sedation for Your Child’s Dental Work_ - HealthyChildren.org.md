# Anesthesia or Sedation for Your Child’s Dental Work? 

## By: Rita Agarwal, MD, FAAP & James Tom, DDS, MS 

## Young children with dental pain and/or infection require treatment 

## at any age—sometimes that means your child will need to go under 

## general anesthesia or sedation. Of course, there are many reasons 

## for this. Some dental procedures require your child to lie 

## completely still, there may be a lot to fix, or the noise of the drill 

## may be scary. The goal is always to provide the safest, most pain

## free treatment. 

## How Safe is Anesthesia or Sedation in 

## Dental Procedures for Children? 

## In 2019, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) updated 

## the current guidelines (/English/news/Pages/Updated-Guidelines-on-Dental-Sedation.aspx) for dentists and oral 

## surgeons to follow when providing deep sedation or general anesthesia to children. 

## It requires that there are always at least 2 people in the room who are trained to provide advanced life support 

## measures in case there are any problems. One of these people will be the dentist or oral surgeon performing the 

## procedure and the other will be an independent observer. This independent observer must be "a physician 

## anesthesiologist, a certified registered nurse anesthetist, a second oral surgeon, or a dentist anesthesiologist." 

## The following information provides an overview of the various types of sedation and anesthesia. It's important 

## for parents to know their options. Talk with your child's dentist or oral surgeon about the type of sedation or 

## anesthesia he or she recommends (and regularly practices) for your child's dental work before the 

## appointment. 

## Types of Sedation and Anesthesia Used on Children—Know Your 

## Options: 

## Nitrous oxide: This is a mild sedative and the least invasive. It's commonly known as 'giggle gas' or 'laughing gas.' 

## Children breathe this with a little oxygen. They don't usually go to sleep, but most will get more relaxed. Most will 

## get a little silly and lightheaded, but a few don't like the feeling. 

## Mild sedation: This medication (or a combination of medications) are commonly used on older children and 

## adults. Your child would be calm and awake—and sometimes able to do what the dentist or surgeon asks him or 

## her to do. After the procedure, your child may not even remember things about the dental visit. Dentists and oral 

## surgeons can safely give these medications while they do the dental work, because your child remains awake. 

## Moderate sedation: Under moderate sedation children are sleepier, but they are usually able to do what the 

## dentist or oral surgeon asks them to do. Older children and young adults do better with moderate sedation than 

## younger or more fearful children. They breathe on their own and will usually wake up easily. Most children will 

## not remember anything about the procedure. Dentists and oral surgeons can safely give these medications while 

## they do the dental work. 

## Deep sedation: This involves intravenous (IV) medications to help your child sleep through the procedure. 

## While your child may still move a little and sometimes make noises, he or she may not be able to breathe well on 

## his or her own. There must always be at least one additional qualified professional (independent observer), such 

## as an anesthesiologist (see Who's Who list below) who can monitor your child's heart rate, heart rhythm, blood 

## pressure, and oxygen saturation (breathing) during the procedure and until he or she wakes up. This 

## professional can also determine when your child is ready to go home. 


#### General anesthesia: Under general anesthesia, your child will be completely asleep and pain free. Specially

#### trained anesthesia professionals (physicians, dentists, or certified nurse anesthetists) will administer 

#### medications and monitor your child while a separate dentist or oral surgeon performs the dental procedure or 

#### surgery. Anesthesia can be given in a dental office that is specially equipped, an ambulatory surgical center 

#### (ASC), or a hospital. 

## Medication Administration During Children's Dental Procedures— 

## Know the Who's Who: 

#### After you discuss the options for sedation and anesthesia with your child's dentist or oral surgeon, find out exactly 

#### who will be administering the medications and who will be watching your child during the dental procedure. 

#### Here's an overview of the various medical and dental professionals who may be involved in your child's dental 

#### procedure. Knowledge is power—familiarize yourself with the list below. 

### Note: The new AAP and the AAPD new guidelines state that an anesthesia professional or a another dentist or oral 

### surgeon who is licensed and trained in anesthesia be with your child while the dentist or oral surgeon concentrates 

### on the procedure. This person will deliver and monitor deep sedation and general anesthesia while the dentist or oral 

### surgeon is performing dental surgery on your child. Other personnel may also be present to assist with deep sedation 

### and general anesthesia or the dental surgery. 

#### General dentist: Has completed college, dental school, and passed all required exams through a State Dental 

#### Board. A general dentist has also obtained a dental license through his or her state. 

#### Pediatric dentist: Has completed all the above training and licensure as a general dentist, as well as a pediatric 

#### dental residency (usually 2-3 years). Pediatric sedation training is included in the residency training. Pediatric 

#### dentists (/English/family-life/health-management/pediatric-specialists/Pages/What-is-a-Pediatric-Dentist.aspx) 

#### may be board certified by taking and passing a national exam. 

#### Oral and maxillofacial surgeon: Completes an oral maxillofacial residency after dental school (4-6 years). 

#### Most oral and maxillofacial surgeons have a dental license, and some also have a medical license. In addition, 

#### some are granted a general anesthesia permit by a State Dental Board. Oral and maxillofacial surgeons may be 

#### board certified by taking and passing a national exam. 

#### Anesthesiologist: A physician or dentist who completes a 3-5-year anesthesiology residency after medical or 

#### dental school and passes all required exams. Anesthesiologists can administer anesthesia for dental procedures 

#### and oral surgery, and they may have a permit from a State Dental Board to deliver anesthesia in a dental office. 

#### Physician and dentist anesthesiologists may have specialized training to treat children, and they may have board 

#### certification by taking and passing a national exam. 

#### Nurse anesthetist: A registered nurse who completes a 2-year program after nursing school and has additional 

#### clinical experience. In some states, nurse anesthetists can administer anesthesia in a dental office without the 

#### supervision of a dentist or physician. 

#### Dental hygienist: Completes a 2-year dental hygiene degree after high school—usually an Associate's Degree. 

#### Some dental hygienists have additional education and training such as a Bachelor's Degree. They are licensed by 

#### their state and can give local anesthesia (numbing shots) in the mouth. 

#### Dental assistant: No formal training is required. Training may be "on the job." There are also 10-12-month 

#### certificate programs. Dental assistants may be registered by their state dental board. Dental assistants do not 

#### qualify as independent observers for deep sedation or general anesthesia. 

#### Dental sedation assistant: Requirements vary from state to state, but the dental sedation assistant can obtain a 

#### certificate allowing him or her to help watch patients under anesthesia. Certificates can be obtained via an online 

#### education program or at an approved on-site educational program. Dental assistants, however, cannot administer 

#### sedation or rescue medications on their own in a dental office. 

#### For any child receiving deep sedation or general anesthesia an anesthesia professional or another 

#### dentist/oral surgeon who is trained in anesthesia must be present to help care for your child.
