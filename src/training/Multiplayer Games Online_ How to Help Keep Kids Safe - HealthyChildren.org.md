# Multiplayer Games Online: How to Help Keep Kids Safe 

## By: Michael Rich, MD, MPH, FAAP 

## If your child hasn't asked to play a multiplayer game 

## online yet, chances are good they will. Also known as 

## massively multiplayer online games (MMOs or 

## MMOGs), these games are extremely popular with 

## people of all ages. A few examples of popular MMOs are 

## World of Warcraft, Minecraft, Fortnite, FarmVille and 

## World of Tanks. Most MMOs let people play with, talk 

## to and message with others live on the game's network. 

## Risks & benefits of multiplayer 

## online games 

## Playing MMOs can give your child experience with cooperation and teamwork. They can also be a good way to 

## socialize and build relationships with friends. You can even enjoy playing them together as a family. 

## Along with potential benefits, though, it's important to also be aware of the risks MMOs can have. Here's how to 

## embrace the positive aspects of MMOs while also keeping your child safe. 

## Talk with your child about online safety 

## It's important to discuss how to be safe online with your child before they play MMOs. These are lessons they'll use for 

## the rest of their life. 

## Here's what to talk through together: 

## Which friends and family members they're allowed to play with 

## Why they should only play online with people they know and avoid strangers 

## Why it's important not to share personal information online with anyone 

## How to enable privacy settings to stop strangers from contacting them (for older kids and teens) 

## How to delete or block people on their contact lists 

## That it is OK to talk with you if something bad happens during the game. 

## To let you know if a stranger contacts them or they feel bullied (/English/family

## life/Media/Pages/Cyberbullying.aspx) by other players 

## Why they should never meet with someone they only "know" online in the real world 

## Choose games with safe environments or use parental controls 

## A great place to get information on games—as well as TV, books, movies, and apps—is Common Sense Media 

## (https://www.commonsensemedia.org/). The site has detailed game reviews for parents that look at the subjects and 

## skills the game enhances. The reviews also rate features such as educational content, violence, language and sex. 

## If you're looking for MMOs for younger kids, try to choose games more limited communication or no communication 

## between players. Pokémon Sun, Pokémon Moon, Just Dance 2020, and Star Wars Battlefront II are some examples of 

## MMOs with "safer" environments. 


### Disabling chat & restricting content 

#### Keep in mind that although some MMOs don't offer live voice chatting, players can still use the game console's built

#### in chatting system. (Star Wars Battlefront II and Terraria are examples of this.) You can disable voice chat and manage 

#### communication in the parental controls (https://www.esrb.org/tools-for-parents/parental-controls/) on the game 

#### console or device. You can also restrict content, manage screen time and set spending limits using parental or family 

#### controls. 

#### Many MMOs offer parental controls too. For instance, popular games like Roblox and Fortnite let you restrict instant 

#### messaging and chatting. Roblox also allows parents to choose the types of games their children can play. Minecraft 

#### lets kids add, block, mute, and report other players, so make sure kids learn why and how to use these features when 

#### they start playing the game. Minecraft also has chat filters to make sure profanity and personal information doesn't go 

#### through. 

### Private access options 

#### Another good option for letting kids play online with their friends is to choose games made for small groups or that 

#### have private access. Minecraft offers the option to buy Minecraft Realms, for example, which lets kids play with 

#### friends in their own private online world. Terraria allows kids to connect with a maximum of 7 other players (and has 

#### no communication options). Many online games let players set up their own private link that they can send to their 

#### friends. 

## Stay involved 

#### Engaging with your child and keeping communication open is one of the most important ways you can help them stay 

#### safe. 

#### Ask your child to tell you about the games they like and why. Play it with them (ask them to teach you how—they 

#### enjoy that) or watch them play. 

#### Make it a point to check in often about who your child is gaming with and if they've had any strangers contact 

#### them. 

#### Keep the device or computer your child is using in a room with plenty of traffic, such as the living room, family 

#### room, or kitchen. This lets you see what they're doing without hovering over them. 

#### Check out any MMOs your child wants to play beforehand. Make yourself aware of the content and use parental 

#### controls to guide your child's play. 

## Set time limits on gaming 

#### As with any type of screen, it's important to give your child limits on gaming. They need to have time for other 

#### activities such as homework, chores and being active (/English/healthy-living/fitness/StopWatch

#### Tool/Pages/default.aspx). Our Family Media Plan (/English/media/Pages/default.aspx#wizard) helps you create an 

#### individual plan for each child. You can also figure out how much time your child has for gaming each day with the 

#### included media time calculator.
