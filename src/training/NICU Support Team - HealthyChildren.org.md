# NICU Support Team 

## “My husband has never been comfortable asking for 

## directions or help of any kind. But even he has to admit 

## that the support staff who guided us through our NICU 

## stay were necessary and important for a good 

## experience.” 

## It takes a village to raise a child, and in the NICU, a “village” supports the medical team, nursing team, and your baby. 

## Again, each NICU may have some or all of these team members, and not every baby will require the services of every 

## one of these team members. 

## Respiratory Therapist 

## If your baby needs help breathing, a respiratory therapist, also known as a respiratory care practitioner, will help 

## manage the appropriate equipment and associated monitoring devices. Some respiratory therapists are trained in 

## endotracheal intubation and may also draw blood to obtain a blood gas from your baby. 

## Nutritionist 

## The nutritional aspects of your baby’s care may be supported by a pediatric or neonatal nutritionist who will help 

## optimize your baby’s growth and development and may recommend specific additives for your baby’s breast milk or 

## formula. 

## Lactation Specialist 

## Breastfeeding support may be provided by lactation specialists, or by lactation nurses or doctors who have specialized 

## training within your NICU. The lactation specialist manages complex problems of breastfeeding mothers and babies. 

## Infant Developmental Specialist 

## Infant development specialists are individuals with training who work with the NICU team to assess your baby’s 

## development. These services may be provided by a variety of people, all ensuring that your baby’s environment in the 

## NICU and after discharge is optimal for his or her development. 

## Pediatric/Family Clinical Psychologist 

## Clinical psychologists may also be available in your NICU to help the team provide support to you. These specialists 

## focus on supporting parents as they develop relationships with their infants and with the NICU staff. 

## Social Worker 

## A social worker in the NICU will help coordinate a myriad of services including your own support structure, financial 

## and insurance arrangement, and even housing and transportation needs. 

## Parent Educator 

## Your unit may also have a parent educator, usually a nurse, who provides information and instruction for NICU 

## families. This education is usually offered in a group setting, such as through scheduled classes. 


## Pharmacist 

### A pharmacist with specific training in neonatal drugs and doses helps ensure the safety of medications and IV 

### nutrition used to treat your baby. 

## Therapists 

### Occupational, physical, and speech therapists all have special skills to help foster your baby’s neurologic and physical 

### development. These therapists may help with establishing a nipple-feeding program for your baby and may also 

### recommend a range of exercises and stretches for your baby. 

## Case Manager/Discharge Planner 

### Some NICUs use the services of a case manager or discharge planner who may follow your baby’s hospital course and 

### ensures that orderly progress is being made toward discharge. Either of these people may also help arrange for your 

### baby’s transfer to a NICU closer to home. 

## Medical Students/Nursing Students 

### If your baby’s NICU is part of an academic medical center, medical students and nursing students may also be present 

### in the unit. These students are not yet physicians or RNs but have typically completed all of their core medical or 

### nursing training. Medical and nursing students are closely supervised while working in the NICU. 

## Chaplain 

### Your NICU may also have a chaplain or spiritual representative from a specific religion. If one is not present in the 

### NICU, you can often request a member of your religious affiliation to visit the NICU. The chaplain’s role is not to 

### convince you to believe or practice religion in any particular way, but rather to help you use any spiritual resources 

### comfortable for you. 

## Research Investigators 

### Many NICUs participate in research projects to improve the quality of care for babies or to better understand and treat 

### the diseases of newborns. To help facilitate these research projects, your NICU may have one or more clinical 

### investigators (nurses and/or physicians) present who can discuss whether your baby might be eligible to participate 

### in one of these research projects. Rest assured that your choice to participate or not participate in any research will 

### not change the quality of your baby’s care or the devotion of the team in providing that care. 

## Parent-to-Parent Providers 

### Your NICU may have a team of parents, some of whom are still in the unit and others of whom have gone home with 

### their babies, who serve as a resource to newer parents in the NICU. These “veteran” parent groups do not provide any 

### care for your baby; rather, they help provide care for you. Referred to as family or parent support groups, parent-to

### parent providers, or peer advocates, these parents have “been there” and know the details specific to your unit. Your 

### unit may also participate in the March of Dimes NICU Family Support Program. Whatever the name of these parents 

### in your NICU, they can provide a listening ear, validate your experiences, provide suggestions on who can best answer 

### your questions, and remind you that you are not “in this” alone. 

## Unit Clerk 

### When you enter the NICU, you are greeted by the unit clerk who handles the flow of people, paper, and information 

### into and out of the NICU. This person may be identified by other titles, such as unit secretary, patient services 

### coordinator, or health unit coordinator. 

## Financial Counselor 

### Your hospital’s financial counselor can answer questions concerning your hospital bill, help you submit your bill to 

### the appropriate agencies for payment, and set up a payment plan if you are responsible for any portion of the bill. 

## Simulation Center Staff 

### Your NICU or hospital may have a simulation center where both care team members and parents can undergo 

### simulated experiences with mannequin babies to improve care and learn necessary skills for taking care of the baby 

### after discharge. You may learn specialized care techniques for your baby in one of these simulation centers or simply 

### have a chance to practice CPR or rescue breathing as part of routine first aid training. If your NICU has a simulation 

### center, you may meet a simulation center coordinator or coach sometime during your baby’s hospitalization.

## Still More People 

### Other personnel in the NICU may include laboratory technicians (trained to obtain blood samples); x-ray technicians; 

### ultrasound technicians; patient care associates who help keep bedside supplies stocked; and others, including 

### housekeepers. Sometimes staff members are cross-trained; in addition to their specialty role, they can help perform 

### unit duties such as taking routine vital signs, administering uncomplicated feedings, and transporting patients to 

### different areas of the hospital. Whether providing direct care or mopping the floor, all hospital personnel provide vital 

### services for your baby’s care.
