# Ensuring Proper Latch On While Breastfeeding 

## Sometimes, making sure your breast-fed baby to "latch 

## on" properly takes a little practice. Trying different 

## breastfeeding holds can help. Read on for information 

## about positioning your baby to make latching on easier, 

## along with other tips. 

## Breastfeeding positions: getting 

## lined up 

## Whichever nursing position (/English/ages

## stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Positioning-Your

## Baby-For-Breastfeeding.aspx) you use, check that you 

## and your baby are lined up the right way. You should be able to draw a straight line that connects your baby's ear, 

## shoulder and hip on either side of their body. 

## Once you and your baby are in proper position, the next step is to guide them toward the breast so that they can latch 

## on properly and nurse. Latching on effectively is crucial to breastfeeding successfully because it prevents sore 

## nipples, ensures sufficient milk supply, and stimulates plentiful milk production. 

## In most cases (other than in the reclining position), you'll need to support your breast, at least in the early days of 

## breastfeeding. This will help your baby attach properly. This is especially true as milk production increases your 

## breasts' size and weight. 

## Using the C-hold to breastfeed your baby 

## Using your free hand, place four fingers under your breast and your thumb on top to present the nipple to your baby. 

## (Your lactation specialist or nurse may refer to this as a C-hold, since your hand makes the shape of a letter C.) Make 

## sure your fingers are well behind the areola (the darker-colored area around the nipple) so it doesn't get in the way of 

## your baby's latching on to the breast. You can provide gentle compression of the breast with your fingers to make it 

## easier for your baby to latch. 

## With the breast supported, stroke your baby's lower lip with your nipple or bring their chin in to touch the breast 

## closely. This causes your baby to open their mouth. (If their mouth stays closed, stroke their lip again, press gently 

## down on their chin with your index finger and open your own mouth, too, since they might imitate you.) 

## Once your baby opens wide—not just a little, but as though they're giving a big yawn—quickly draw them closer and 

## place their open mouth fully on your breast. This guiding movement should be quick but gentle. Remember that you 

## should bring your baby to your breast, not push your breast into their mouth. If your baby's head is pushed into the 

## breast so hard that they cannot breathe, they may become agitated or frightened. They may arch their back and refuse 

## to feed. Do not push on the baby's head, but keep your hand supporting their upper back and neck in place. 

## What does a good breastfeeding latch look like? 

## If your baby is in proper nursing position, their jaws will come together on your areola and their lips will seal over your 

## breast. Their chin should be touching your breast, and their nose will be close to your breast. (They will be able to 

## breathe, but if you are concerned about their breathing, try lifting your breast or changing the angle of his body 

## slightly, pulling their bottom in more closely to your body.) Helping them latch on in a slightly asymmetric fashion, so 

## that a bit more of the areola is in their mouth on the lower-lip side and a bit less on the upper-lip side, will position the 

## nipple so it points toward the roof of the baby's mouth.

## How do you fix a painful breastfeeding latch? 

#### You may feel slight discomfort when your baby first latches on and perhaps even for the first few sucks. But once they 

### begin to suckle steadily you should not feel pain. Pain beyond the first minute or so of nursing is a sign of improper 

### latching on and should be immediately corrected. You can practice more, or get help from your pediatrician, family 

### physician, nurse or lactation specialist. When pain persists throughout nursing, detach the baby by inserting your 

### finger in thecorner of their mouth to break the suction and relatch them. Make sure that their mouth is wide open 

### before latching. 

## Helping your baby open wider to latch 

#### The key to successful latching on involves your baby taking enough of the breast into the mouth. When this happens, 

#### the nipple is drawn to the back of the baby's mouth and his gums and tongue are compressing the areola, covering 

#### about an inch or two of the areola from the base of the nipple. When your baby is latched well, suckling begins with 

#### movements of their jaw and tongue to move the milk from the breast through the tiny holes in your nipple. To achieve 

#### this, your baby's mouth must truly be open wide as they latch on. Many early nursing mistakes occur when the 

#### mother hasn't waited until her baby's jaws are about as wide as they can be before she pulls the baby to the breast. As a 

#### result, the baby sucks on the nipple only, a position that limits the amount of milk received and soon makes the nipple 

#### sore. 

#### To help your baby take in a large mouthful, use your C-hold to gently compress your breast; this makes the areola 

#### narrower and the nipple stick out more so it is easier to grasp. You can think of giving your baby a "sandwich" of breast, 

#### aligning your C-hold to match the direction they would take a bite of a sandwhich in whichever position you are using. 

#### Be sure to guide them to the sandwich chin-first. As they latch on, their tongue should stick out a bit, cover their lower 

#### gum and partially envelop the breast. Their lips should turn outward like a fish and press against your breast. 

## The latching learning curve 

#### Many new parents assume that infants are born knowing instinctively how to attach themselves to the breast—that if 

#### you present your breast the right way, they will know what to do. Certainly some babies are capable of self-attachment, 

#### with good technique. This is most likely to happen in the first hour after birth but can be repeated later on. 

#### (Researchers have studied infants who are able to maneuver themselves from the mother's lower abdomen, where 

#### they were placed immediately after delivery, up to the nipple, where they self-attach and start suckling. This has been 

#### called the "breast crawl.") 

#### Most newborns do easily learn to latch on to the breast and soon begin the deep, regular suckling and rhythmic 

#### swallowing that signal successful nursing. But not all babies know instinctively how to latch on. You may need to teach 

#### your baby until they experience enough successful feedings to associate their feeding behaviors with the satiation of 

#### their hunger. 

## Try, try again 

#### If your baby doesn't manage to latch on properly the first time, gently detach them by sliding your finger into their 

#### mouth and pressing down on your breast to break the suction. You'll know your baby didn't latch on properly if you 

#### see indentations in their cheeks when they suckle, hear clicking noises or notice their lips curled inward. They may 

#### also move their head frequently or not do any swallowing. 

#### Incorrect latching may also cause pain for you. Don't try to just pull him off your breast, since this could cause nipple 

#### pain. Keep practicing this latch-on technique until you and your newborn have mastered it, and don't hesitate to ask 

#### the hospital nurses and lactation specialists for help.
