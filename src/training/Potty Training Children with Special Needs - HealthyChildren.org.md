# Potty Training Children with Special Needs 

## The issue of when and how to begin toilet training 

## (/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet

## training/Pages/default.aspx) can be particularly 

## challenging for parents of children with special needs. 

## The sense of accomplishment when they do succeed in 

## this important aspect of self-care can make an 

## enormous difference in their level of self-esteem 

## (/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet

## training/pages/Increasing-Confidence-and-Self

## Esteem-During-Toilet-Training.aspx). 

## Perhaps more than other parents, those who have 

## children with physical, intellectual, or developmental 

## disabilities (/english/health-issues/conditions/developmental-disabilities/Pages/default.aspx) can appreciate the 

## toilet-training process as a way to follow and celebrate a child’s overall growth. Rather than focusing negatively on 

## setbacks, which are inevitable in any case, they can use the setbacks as opportunities to discover how their child 

## learns best and to demonstrate to them that they are able to progress. 

## Toilet training works best when parents of children with special needs have access to the guidance, instruction, and 

## encouragement of their pediatrician, other trained professionals (including school personnel), support groups, or a 

## combination of all. The first step you must take is to determine whether your child is ready to begin. 

## Signs of potty training readiness are the same for your child as for all children: 

## Is your child aware of the difference between being wet and being dry? 

## Can they stay dry for at least two hours at a time? 

## Can they sense when he needs to urinate or have a bowel movement? 

## Are they capable of reaching the toilet or potty in time (perhaps with your help)? 

## Can they undress and dress themselves or are they ready to learn? 

## Are they motivated at some level to take this next step? 

## If your child is in a resistant phase, is not ready to take on a new challenge, or does not yet feel the urge to behave "like 

## other kids" in this way, you might take some extra time to prepare them mentally before starting the potty training 

## process. 

## If you feel that your child is ready, ask your pediatrician for their opinion. They can examine your child to offer a 

## physical assessment and perhaps special insight into the particular needs of your child. They can also provide further 

## information that you may need before starting, and let you know what types of special equipment may be advisable. 

## It is also important to prepare yourself emotionally before you and your child begin the process. Children with special 

## needs often begin toilet training later than other children, frequently completing the process at age five years old or 

## even later. Of course, children with some conditions may always need help with their clothing (button, zippers, tights) 

## and some might need help getting to the bathroom. Some will develop innovative ways of achieving independence. 

## Learning to use the toilet can be physically painful to some, and challenging for others to understand. Accidents will 

## happen, of course, and you will need to draw on an extra dose of patience and humor when they occur. Ask for help 

## from your spouse, relatives or friends before you begin. 


## Physical challenges 

#### A number of physical disabilities and illnesses can hinder a child’s ability to become fully toilet-trained or easily 

#### adjust to bathroom use. If your child faces such a challenge, you will need to think about how their unique situation 

#### affects each stage of toilet training and how you can compensate. Whether your child is unable to sense the need to 

#### urinate, has difficulty getting onto or staying on a standard potty or toilet or must adjust or readjust to toilet use after 

#### having used an ostomy device, they will need extra support from you and their other caregivers as they learn to 

#### master this new skill. 

## Visual disabilities 

#### Children with visual disabilities (/English/health-issues/conditions/eyes/pages/Warning-Signs-of-Vison-Problems

#### in-Children.aspx) and those with sight deficiencies experience a disadvantage at several stages of toilet training. First, 

#### they might be unable to observe family members and peers using the toilet, so they cannot mimic their behavior. So 

#### many details of toilet or potty use—where the potty is in the bathroom, how the body is oriented to it as one sits down, 

#### how the urine and poop get into the potty, how one tears off and uses toilet paper—are simple to understand if a child 

#### can observe the process but difficult if they cannot. Without sight to help them, your child will need to rely more on 

#### language to understand how the process works. Because of this, you will probably want to wait a little longer to begin 

#### potty training—until they are three or four years old (or even later, since language delays (/English/ages

#### stages/toddler/Pages/Language-Delay.aspx) can accompany blindness)—so that they can fully comprehend what you 

#### are telling her. 

#### When you are ready to introduce your child with a visual impairment to the concept of toilet use, start bringing them 

#### with you when you use the bathroom. Allow them to explore the bathroom and locate the toilet. (Be sure it’s well 

#### ventilated and smells pleasant so they will want to return.) Place their hands on your shoulders so they can feel you 

#### sitting on the toilet, explain what you are doing and why, and guide her hands to the toilet paper dispenser. Also show 

#### them the flush handle and the sink for hand washing. 

#### Once you have placed a potty in the bathroom, lead them to it, let them accustom herself to its presence, and keep it in 

#### the same place throughout the toilet-training process. Talk to them about toilet use at other times, too—pointing out 

#### that most of the people they knows use the toilet and that toilet use is a sign of being a big kid who can take care of 

#### themselves. 

#### Once your child begins practicing potty use themselves, keep the bathroom and the passage to it clear of obstacles. A 

#### musical potty that is activated when urine hits the bowl might make the learning process more fun. Teach them to feel 

#### the inner edge of the seat before tossing in the toilet paper and, if the child is a boy urinating standing up at a toilet, to 

#### position his body so he doesn’t urinate on the toilet itself. (You may want to have your son first sit to urinate; once he 

#### masters that skill, then you can teach him to stand in front of the toilet.) 

#### Finally, as your child grows more comfortable with bathroom use, make a point of taking them to the bathroom at 

#### each public place you visit. By helping them familiarize themselves with the wide variety of bathroom layouts and 

#### toilet styles, you will help build their self-confidence when away from home and prevent accidents. And don’t forget to 

#### reward their progress with praise, hugs or a small reward. 

## Hearing disabilities 

#### Children who are deaf or have difficulty hearing (/English/health-issues/conditions/developmental

#### disabilities/Pages/Hearing-Loss.aspx)may or may not find toilet training challenging, depending on their ability to 

#### communicate. A child who is already fluent in sign language (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/These-Hands-Were

#### Made-for-Talking.aspx) can rely on a combination of visual observation and explanations from you to understand 

#### what’s expected of them—much like any other child. Children who do not yet have the ability to understand your 

#### signals and simple signs may not be ready for toilet training until they are somewhat older. 

#### The key to training in these cases is to keep the process simple. When introducing the concept, emphasize the visual: 

#### Allow your child to observe you (and, even better, other children) using the bathroom, and show them picture books 

### about it. Choose one gesture or sign for the essential terms (pee, poop, potty, wet, dry, and need to go). Use these 

#### gestures each time you use the bathroom, and use them with them as well—signing "wet" (with a sad face) when you 

#### change her diaper or wet underwear, "dry" (with a happy expression) once they've been changed, and "need to go" after 

#### lunch when it’s time to sit on the potty. 

#### As long as you are consistent and stick with the half-dozen signals you need, your child will get the hang of potty use 

#### without longer explanations. When they do, be sure to reward them with plenty of hugs, stars on a potty chart or 

#### another small reward.

## Continence problems 

#### Some conditions have no effect on a child’s ability to understand the process of toilet training but make it difficult for 

#### a child to comply. Your child may grow increasingly frustrated in their efforts to stay dry and may even give up trying. 

#### The best solution to this dilemma is to put your child on a regular potty schedule. By placing them on the potty 

#### frequently (reminding them every hour or so to visit the bathroom), you remove the burden of having to acknowledge 

#### so many times each day that they must interrupt an activity to tend to their physical needs. Going to the bathroom at 

#### the top of every hour can become a habit similar to brushing teeth twice a day or getting dressed in the morning— 

#### freeing her up to focus on other activities between visits. 

## Cerebral palsy 

#### Children with cerebral palsy (/English/health-issues/conditions/developmental-disabilities/Pages/Cerebral

#### Palsy.aspx) not only tend to be slow in developing bladder control, but may not have enough bladder awareness to 

#### begin toilet training at age two or three. If your child has cerebral palsy, they will need help to develop an awareness 

#### they needs to go (which may be signaled to you when you see them clutching their genitals or fidgeting anxiously) 

#### before they can begin toilet training. They will have to be able to delay urination until they are in position on the potty. 

#### They will need to remove their clothing and then hold themselves on the potty (with supports) long enough to achieve 

#### success. Again, these challenges mean that it is usually best to wait to toilet-train until they are older. 

#### It is possible that limited physical activity, undeveloped muscle tone, or medications may cause constipation 

#### (/English/health-issues/conditions/abdominal/Pages/constipation.aspx) for your child with cerebral palsy. So, pay 

#### special attention to their diet as you start toilet-training. Make sure they are drinking plenty of fluids and eating foods 

#### high in fiber (/English/ages-stages/teen/nutrition/Pages/Fiber-An-Important-Part-of-Your-Teens-Diet.aspx) such as 

#### fruits and vegetables. As they begin to practice removing her clothes before getting onto the potty, make it easier by 

#### providing clothes with Velcro fasteners or loose elastic waistbands. (They may find it easier to remove her clothes 

#### while lying down.) 

## Spina bifida and spinal cord injury 

#### Spina bifida (/English/health-issues/conditions/developmental-disabilities/Pages/Spina-Bifida.aspx), spinal cord 

#### injury, or spinal tumors create toilet-training problems for young children similar to those of cerebral palsy. But since 

#### most children with this condition never develop an awareness of when they need to go, few can ever fully use a toilet. 

#### You can, however, teach your child to remove urine through a catheter on a regular basis, and to visit the bathroom for 

#### bowel movements on a regular schedule. (A high-fiber diet with plenty of liquids and meals served on a regular 

#### schedule will make this process easier. Sometimes a stool softener or even a suppository or enema is needed.) Since 

#### your child will find it difficult to remove her clothing, be sure to provide them with Velcro fastened clothes and allow 

#### them to lie down to undress if necessary. 

#### A child with spinal cord dysfunctions will likely not feel the need to move their bowels and have a greater risk of being 

#### constipated. Help prevent constipation by giving them enough fluids and a diet high in fiber. They may need to be on a 

#### bowel regimen designed so that they have a bowel movement at home and then does not have a bowel movement at 

#### school. Your pediatrician and therapist should be able to help develop a successful program for your child. They will 

#### need regular catheterizations, and either an aide or school nurse will have to help until your child can perform their 

#### own catheterizations. 

#### Parents of children with physical disabilities such as cerebral palsy or spina bifida may become so distracted by the 

#### need for special equipment or physical support that they neglect the cognitive and emotional support that all children 

#### need to succeed at toilet training. 

#### While installing that special potty in the bathroom, talk with your child about using the potty and why it’s important. 

#### Let them observe you and others using the bathroom, and praise and reward them when they succeed even a little bit. 

#### Resist the temptation to "let things go" when there is difficulty and remain firm about the schedule or routine you 

#### have created—unless the experience becomes negative and your child becomes very resistant. Remember, their 

#### progress is especially significant if it increases their self-confidence and prepares them for more challenges. Give 

#### them all the information, attention and support they need to succeed. 

## Behavioral and mental disorders 

#### Your experience toilet-training a toddler who has been identified as having developmental or behavioral difficulties 

#### will depend a great deal on your particular child’s temperament, behavior patterns and coexisting conditions. Your 

#### knowledge of your child’s strengths, weaknesses, tendencies and interests will help the process. 

##### Back to Top 


#### Toilet training can be particularly trying for parents of children who have developmental disorders or behavioral 

#### difficulties. This includes those with autism (/English/health-issues/conditions/chronic/pages/Autism.aspx), fetal 

#### alcohol syndrome (FAS) (/English/ages-stages/prenatal/Pages/Fetal-Alcohol-Spectrum-Disorders.aspx), oppositional 

#### defiant disorder (ODD) (/English/health-issues/conditions/emotional-problems/Pages/Disruptive-Behavior

#### Disorders.aspx), and, in cases when it is diagnosed this early, attention deficit /hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) 

#### (/English/health-issues/conditions/adhd/Pages/default.aspx). Many children with these conditions may not be 

#### strongly motivated, or sufficiently equipped, to respond to the social reinforcements that work so well with other 

#### children ("What a big boy!"). For some, small tangible rewards such as a sticker or small toy can be effective. 

#### Many find it extremely difficult to adjust to any change in routine. Some are particularly sensitive to touch and other 

#### sensory input and become upset by the frequent pulling off and on of clothing, the physical closeness with an adult 

#### and the unfamiliar surroundings of the bathroom. 

#### For some children, simply learning the abstract concept of potty use can be complicated. For example, some children 

#### with behavioral disorders do not naturally imitate their parents’ or peers’ behavior. Others learn only through simple 

#### imitation or other concrete, nonverbal demonstrations. Such complications in the training process mean that early 

#### efforts can create a high level of frustration in your child and may lead to displays of temper, stubbornness, and refusal 

#### to cooperate. 

#### Despite challenges, most children with special needs—whether they have physical challenges or behavioral issues— 

#### can be toilet trained, though in some cases the process may take up to a year or even longer. They may require help 

#### from an occupational or physical therapist or a rehabilitation engineer. 

#### Your first step is to determine whether your child is ready to start training. Usually the time to think about beginning 

#### is when you notice that they can stay dry for an hour or more at a time, has regular bowel movements, is aware that he 

#### is about to pee or poop and dislikes being wet or soiled. It is also important to have your child examined by their 

#### pediatrician, since they may be at a higher risk for constipation or loose stools, which may interfere with training. 

#### Once you have decided to begin, observe your child and consider carefully the specific traits, patterns of behavior, and 

#### obstacles that may impact their learning process. If they seems to dislike entering the bathroom, determine the cause 

#### of their discomfort. Is it the smell of disinfectant? The cold floor? The flushing toilet? Change or fix it if possible 

#### (change cleansers, put socks on their feet, move their potty away from the noisy toilet). 

#### If they do not overtly signal the need to go, do they pause just before voiding or otherwise behave in a way that will 

#### provide you with a cue? At what times, or how long after eating or drinking, does he usually pee or poop? What foods, 

#### toys or other objects are they most passionate about? These can be used as tangible potty-training rewards, which may 

#### prove more effective than praise. 

#### Identify how your child learns best. Some respond to firm but gentle physical demonstrations (being placed on the 

#### potty at regular times). Others do best with a formal routine containing a series of simple and predictable steps 

#### (verbally explained and reexplained, illustrated with pictures, or listed on a chart). Still others do best with offhand 

#### comments and conversations that inform without inviting resistance. 

## Intellectual Disabilities and Developmental Disorders 

#### Most children with a developmental delay (/English/news/Pages/Are-Pediatricians-Screening-for-Developmental

#### Delays.aspx), an intellectual disability, or an autism spectrum disorder can be toilet-trained. The time it takes to 

#### achieve success ranges from a few months to a year or more. The process becomes easier as your child achieves at 

#### least a minimal level of verbal ability, is able to manage their clothes (perhaps with some help from you), and shows 

#### awareness of the need to go. 

#### Toilet training for children with developmental delay, intellectual disability or autism spectrum disorder can be quite 

#### similar to training for other children, but sometimes it is not. Like with other children, as you introduce your child to 

#### the concept of potty use, it often helps to keep explanations simple. Start by checking the state of their diaper or pants 

#### every hour or so and offering a one-word, nonjudgmental comment when they are wet ("Wet!"). After you change 

#### them, smile and say "Dry!" If their verbal skills are limited, you might substitute a special gesture or sign for the words 

### wet, dry, potty, need to go, and so on. 

#### Begin bringing them to the bathroom with you when you need to use it. Smile and say "Dry!" after you’ve finished and 

#### pulled your pants up. If at all possible, have your child observe other children using the bathroom, too. They may make 

#### the connection between themselves and another child more easily than between themselves and you. After you’ve 

#### finished and are dressed, show them how happy you are and tell them "Dry!" If they have a favorite doll or stuffed 

#### animal, use it to play "potty," demonstrating again how the potty is used. 

##### Back to Top 


#### When they are ready to begin using the potty, begin setting them on it at regular times—quite frequently at first (as 

#### frequently as you checked them for wetness earlier) and then gradually settling down to the times when they usually 

#### go. Try to keep them on the potty for five or ten minutes at a time—keeping them company, reading to them, playing 

#### children’s music and otherwise ensuring that they stays in place long enough to succeed. Once they do urinate into 

#### the potty, give him a big smile and say "Pee!" (or whatever word you have chosen for this event). Help them wipe off 

#### and then praise them with a happy "Dry!" and give them a reward. Eventually, with enough repetition, they will 

#### understand the connection. 

#### If your child has an intellectual disability or developmental delay, it is best to toilet train one step at a time. Don’t 

#### expect your child to learn to signal or announce their need to go, pull down their pants, use the potty, wipe their 

#### bottom and wash their hands all at once, the way their peers might. Toilet training will work best if you focus on the 

#### actual act of peeing and pooping first and address the other skills later. It is more important to keep them motivated 

#### than to achieve instant success.
