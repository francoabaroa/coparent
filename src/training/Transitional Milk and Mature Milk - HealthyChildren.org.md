# Transitional Milk and Mature Milk 

## Transitional Milk 

## When breastfeeding mothers talk about their milk coming in, they are referring to the onset of 

## production of transitional milk, the creamy milk that immediately follows colostrum. 

## Transitional milk is produced anywhere from about two to five days after birth until ten to 

## fourteen days after birth. 

## Because your breasts will supply a much greater amount of transitional milk than colostrum, 

## your breasts will become larger and firmer during this stage. This new fullness may feel 

## uncomfortable at first and may make it more difficult for your baby to latch on to the breast correctly. With practice, 

## however (and perhaps with the help of your baby’s pediatrician or lactation specialist), you will help your baby latch 

## on. 

## Sometimes expressing a small amount of milk by hand will help to soften the areola enough to make it easier for the 

## baby to latch. The drops of milk on your nipple also will encourage your baby to feed. Breastfeeding will ease the 

## pressure in your breasts and make you feel more comfortable. 

## As your baby latches on and begins to breastfeed steadily, you may notice a tingly pins-and-needles sensation. This 

## feeling tells you that the milk let-down reflex has occurred, causing milk to be pushed out of the milk-producing cells 

## into milk ducts so it’s available to your baby. The let-down reflex can be stimulated by your baby’s suckling, an 

## approaching feeding time, or just the sound ofyour baby’s hungry cry. Once this happens, your milk will flow more 

## plentifully and your baby will enjoy a satisfying feeding. You will hear him swallowing more frequently. You may 

## notice milk dripping or spurting from your other breast when let-down occurs. 

## In the early weeks of breastfeeding, you may notice cramping or “afterpains” of your uterus when the baby feeds at 

## the breast. This is yet another result of the hormone oxytocin. It is important for you to try to relax and rest, as stress, 

## pain, and fatigue may decrease milk production and release. 

## The combination of sharply increased demand and the resulting increased human milk supply may make you feel 

## like you are constantly breastfeeding during this early period. Daytime feedings may be anywhere from one and a half 

## to three hours apart and may range in length from ten minutes to close to an hour each. Human milk is easily 

## digested by the baby, and breastfed newborns typically nurse eight to twelve times a day. Soon, however, the nursing 

## pattern will stabilize, and feedings will become less frequent. Over time, feedings will continue to change in frequency 

## and length, depending upon your baby’s needs. 

## Mature Milk 

## In most women, mature milk begins to appear near the end of the second week after childbirth. Mature milk is 

## produced in as great a volume as transitional milk but is thinner and more watery or even bluish; sometimes it’s 

## described as looking like skim milk when it is first secreted, until the fat is released later in the feeding and it becomes 

## more creamy. 

## Your breasts may appear somewhat softer and smaller than they did during the transitional-milk stage, though they 

## will still be larger than before your pregnancy. These changes in your breasts and in your milk are normal and are 

## designed to provide just what your baby needs for his nutrition, growth, and development. 

## Much later, after your baby begins to sample other liquids and solid foods, breastfeeding sessions will decrease in 

## frequency. Some mothers choose to continue breastfeeding into the toddler or preschool years. By this time, the 

## overall nutritional contribution of breastfeeding has diminished proportionate to the great variety of other beverages 

## and solids the child is consuming. However, human milk continues to be as nutritious as cow’s milk. The emotional 

## and immunologic benefits of the nursing relationship continue throughout the period of lactation.
