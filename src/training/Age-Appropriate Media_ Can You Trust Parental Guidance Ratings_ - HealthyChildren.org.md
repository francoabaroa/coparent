# Age-Appropriate Media: Can You Trust Parental Guidance 

# Ratings? 

## By: Cori Cross, MD, FAAP 

## Have you ever found yourself thinking, "Did they really 

## just say that in a PG-rated movie?" If so, you probably 

## won't be surprised to hear that movie, TV, and video 

## game ratings today aren't the same as when we were 

## kids. 

## Studies show that government and industry movie 

## ratings have become more lenient over time. More 

## violent and sexually explicit content are allowed into 

## films than there used to be. What these ratings mean 

## and whether they can tell you what's appropriate for 

## your child isn't always clear. Even movies with the same rating released in the same year can differ widely in the 

## amount and type of potentially offensive content. 

## How to make healthy media choices for your family 

## We know that children are influenced by what they see and hear, especially at very young ages. Rating systems can be 

## one tool your family uses to choose media that has positive influences—and avoid content with negative influences. 

## Some tips: 

## Learn the ratings lingo 

## Raters often use quotas for scenes that have violence, sex and swearing. Once these quotas are reached, the movie is 

## pushed into a higher rating bracket. Although this may make sense for filmmakers, it can be difficult for parents to 

## navigate. For instance, you may not want your child exposed to certain content, such as vulgar language. For you, even 

## one "f-word" may be too many. 

## Look for ratings and warning labels on media such as movies, TV shows, music, videos and video games. Look at the 

## content information if it's available too. It's usually located in the same area as the rating. This will indicate details 

## about why the raters gave the rating they did. It will also help you find age-appropriate content for your child. 

## Companies such as streaming services don't currently have to use parental guidance ratings at all. This means that 

## the majority of online streaming videos are unrated. Use caution with online videos and products that don't have a 

## rating. Be sure to find out more about them before you let your child play with, listen to or watch them. 

## Co-view media when possible 

## Keep in mind that while ratings can be helpful, they are only a guide. Nothing is better than you listening to and 

## watching media with your kids. The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly recommends co-viewing media 

## (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/Keeping-Technology-in-Check.aspx) with your children as often as you can. This 

## gives you a chance to talk about what you're hearing or seeing and how it fits into your family's values. 

## Whatever media your child is using should be age appropriate. If possible, it should also reinforce your family's 

## values. If you can, it's good to pre-screen what your child watches. That said, with the sheer amount of media kids are 

## exposed to, it's unrealistic that you'll be able to pre-screen or co-view everything. 

## Use family-friendly resources 

## When co-viewing or listening isn't an option, you can refer to reputable, independent resources such as Common 

## Sense Media (https://www.commonsensemedia.org/) (CSM). These resources rate movies, television shows, video 

## games, music, apps, websites and books. 


#### The CSM website and app give in-depth reviews. This allows parents a better sense of what to expect. There are even 

#### suggestions for discussions parents may want to have with their children. The ratings have a 5-dot system and 

#### detailed summaries about what parents may want to know in these categories: 

#### Sex 

#### Language 

#### Consumerism (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/5-Unhealthy-Ways-Digital-Ads-May-Be-Targeting-Your

#### Child.aspx) 

#### Drinking, drugs and smoking (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/How-Cigarette-Advertisements-Influence

#### Teens.aspx) 

#### Violence (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/Virtual-Violence-Impacts-Childrens-Behavior.aspx) 

#### Positive role models 

#### Diverse (/English/healthy-living/emotional-wellness/Building-Resilience/Pages/diverse-and-inclusive-books

#### for-children.aspx) representations 

#### Positive messages 

#### The CSM website and app offer age recommendations with each review. DISH Network and DIRECTV have partnered 

#### with CSM and include these age recommendations on their guide listings too. 

## Federal TV rating guidelines 

### The TV Parental Guidelines (see chart below) are usually included within local TV listings. Ratings aren't used for 

#### news programs. The AAP recommends keeping young children away from repetitive graphic images and sounds that 

#### may appear on news programs—especially after a major tragedy (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/talking-to

#### children-about-tragedies-and-other-news-events.aspx). 

#### If you want older children to watch the news, record it ahead of time. That way, you can preview it before you sit down 

#### with them to watch it. Then, as you watch it together, you can pause and have a discussion when you need to. 

#### All TVs 13 inches or larger made in the United States after 2000 are required by federal law to have a V-chip. This chip 

#### allows parents to block specific shows or groups of programs based on ratings, specific shows, or time slots. Visit the 

#### Federal Communications Commission (FCC) website (https://www.fcc.gov/general/parents) for more information.

## Industry movie rating guidelines 

#### The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) has a voluntary rating system for the movie industry. These 

#### ratings give general guidelines to parents about the level of content they might find inappropriate for their children. 

#### The MPAA's Classification & Ratings Administration (https://www.filmratings.com/History) (CARA) has a board of 

#### independent raters who are required to be parents themselves. They view each film for potentially offensive content, 

#### such as violence, sex, drug use and language. Then they assign ratings based on what they believe most American 

#### parents would consider the film's appropriate rating. 

#### Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) Rating System 

#### Rating Description 

#### G General Audiences. All Ages Admitted. 

#### Contains very little violence and no nudity, sex or drug use. 

#### PG Parental Guidance Suggested. Some Material May Not Be Suitable for Children. 

#### May contain some profanity, violence, or brief nudity. Does not contain drug use. 

#### Parental guidance suggested for more mature themes.

#### use.

## Video game and app rating guidelines 

#### The Electronic Software Ratings Board (https://www.esrb.org/ratings-guide/) (ESRB) gives ratings to video games and 

#### apps. These are like movie ratings—they serve as a guide to help you make informed choices. Nearly all video games 

#### sold in the United States and Canada have ratings. 

#### Electronic Software Ratings Board (ESRB) Rating System

#### violence and/or infrequent use of mild language.

#### RP (Rating 

#### Pending) 

#### Not yet assigned a final ESRB rating. Appears only in advertising, marketing and 

#### promotional materials related to a physical (e.g., boxed) video game that is expected to 

#### carry an ESRB rating, and should be replaced by a game's rating once it has been 

#### assigned. 

## Remember 

#### Official government or industry ratings offer you some general guidance on which shows, movies, and other media 

#### may be appropriate for your child's age. But for most families, they don't replace sitting down with your children and 

#### watching what they're watching—or, when that's not possible, getting a heads-up from reputable, parent-friendly 

#### resources about what they'll see.
