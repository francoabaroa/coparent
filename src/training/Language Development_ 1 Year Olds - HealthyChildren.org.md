# Language Development: 1 Year Olds 

## Early in the second year, your toddler will suddenly seem to understand everything you say. 

## You’ll announce lunchtime and he’ll be waiting by his high chair. You’ll tell him you’ve lost your 

## shoe and he’ll find it. At first, his rapid response may seem a little unusual. Did he really 

## understand, or is this just a dream? Rest assured, it’s not your imagination. He’s developing his 

## language and comprehension skills right on schedule. 

## This giant developmental leap probably will alter the way you now talk to him and converse with 

## others when he’s around. For example, you may edit conversations held within his earshot, 

## perhaps spelling out words you’d rather he didn’t understand (as in, “Should we stop for I-C-E C

## R-E-A-M?”). At the same time, you’ll probably feel more enthusiastic about talking to him, because he’s so responsive. 

## You may find yourself using less baby talk, no longer needing high-pitched singsong monologues to get his attention. 

## Instead, try speaking slowly and clearly, using simple words and short sentences. Teach him the correct names of 

## objects and body parts, and stop using cute substitutes such as “piggies” when you really mean “toes.” By providing a 

## good language model, you’ll help him learn to talk with a minimum of confusion. 

## Most toddlers master at least fifty spoken words by the end of the second year and can put two words together to form 

## a short sentence, although there are differences among children. Even among those with normal hearing and 

## intelligence, some don’t talk much during the second year. Boys generally develop language skills more slowly than 

## girls. Whenever your child begins to speak, his first few words probably will include the names of familiar people, his 

## favorite possessions, and parts of his body. You may be the only person who understands these early words, since he’ll 

## omit or change certain sounds. For example, he might get the first consonant ( b, d, t) and vowel ( a, e, i, o, u) sounds 

## right, but drop the end of the word. Or he may substitute sounds he can pronounce, such as d or b, for more difficult 

## ones. 

## You’ll learn to understand what he’s saying over time and with the help of his gestures. By all means, don’t ridicule his 

## language mistakes. Give him as much time as he needs to finish what he wants to say without hurrying, and then 

## answer with a correct pronunciation of the word (“That’s right, it’s a ball!”). If you’re patient and responsive, his 

## pronunciation will improve gradually. 

## By midyear, he’ll use a few active verbs, such as “go” and “jump,” and words of direction, such as “up,” “down,” “in,” 

## and “out.” By his second birthday, he’ll have mastered the words “me” and “you” and use them all the time. 

## At first, he’ll make his own version of a whole sentence by combining a single word with a gesture or grunt. He might 

## point and say “ball”—his way of telling you he wants you to roll him the ball. Or he might shape a question by saying 

## “Out?” or “Up?”—raising his voice at the end. Soon he’ll begin to combine verbs or prepositions with nouns, to make 

## statements like “Ball up” or “Drink milk,” and questions like “What that?” By the end of the year, or soon thereafter, 

## he’ll begin to use two-word sentences.
