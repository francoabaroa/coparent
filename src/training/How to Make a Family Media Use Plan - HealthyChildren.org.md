## Media Use Plan Tips for Families: 

## Screens should be kept out of kids' bedrooms. Put in place a "media curfew" at mealtime and bedtime, putting all 

## devices away or plugging them into a charging station for the night. 

## Excessive media use has been associated with obesity (/english/health

## issues/conditions/obesity/Pages/default.aspx), lack of sleep, school problems, aggression (/English/family

## life/family-dynamics/communication-discipline/Pages/Aggressive-Behavior.aspx) and other behavior issues 

## (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/communication-discipline/Pages/Evaluating-Behavioral-Problems.aspx). 

## Limit entertainment screen time to less than one or two hours per day. 

## For children under 2, substitute unstructured play and human interaction for screen time. The opportunity to 

## think creatively, problem solve and develop reasoning and motor skills is more valuable for the developing 

## brain than passive media intake. 

## Take an active role in your children's media education by co-viewing programs with them and discussing values 

## (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/communication-discipline/Pages/Share-Your-Values.aspx). 

## Look for media choices that are educational, or teach good values -such as empathy, racial and ethnic tolerance. 

## Choose programming that models good interpersonal skills for children to emulate. 

## Be firm about not viewing content that is not age appropriate: sex, drugs, violence, etc. Movie (/English/family

## life/Media/Pages/Movie-Ratings-and-What-They-Mean.aspx) and TV ratings (/English/family

## help parents to stick to their rules.

### The Internet can be a wonderful place for learning. But it also is a place where kids can run into trouble. Keep the 

### computer in a public part of your home, so you can check on what your kids are doing online and how much time 

### they are spending there. 

### Discuss with your children that every place they go on the Internet may be "remembered," and comments they 

### make will stay there indefinitely. Impress upon them that they are leaving behind a "digital footprint." They 

### should not take actions online that they would not want to be on the record for a very long time. 

### Become familiar with popular social media sites like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. You may consider having 

### your own profile on the social media sites your children use. By "friending" your kids, you can monitor their 

### online presence. Pre-teens should not have accounts on social media sites. If you have young children, you can 

### create accounts on sites that are designed specifically for kids their age. 

### Talk to them about being good "digital citizens," and discuss the serious consequences of online bullying. If your 

### child is the victim of cyberbullying (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/Cyberbullying.aspx), it is important to take 

### action with the other parents and the school if appropriate. Attend to children's and teens' mental health 

### (/English/ages-stages/teen/Pages/Mental-Health-and-Teens-Watch-for-Danger-Signs.aspx) needs promptly if 

### they are being bullied online, and consider separating them from the social media platforms where bullying 

### occurs. 

### Make sure kids of all ages know that it is not appropriate or smart to send or receive pictures of people without 

### clothing, or sexy text messages (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/the-new-problem-of-sexting.aspx), no matter 

### whether they are texting friends or strangers. 

### Check out a sample "Media Time Family Pledge (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/Media-Time-Family

### Pledge.aspx)" for online media use. 

### If you're unsure of the quality of the "media diet" in your household, consult with your children's pediatrician on 

### what your kids are viewing, how much time they are spending with media, and privacy and safety issues 

### associated with social media and Internet use.
