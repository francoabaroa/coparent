# Cognitive Development: 8 to 12 Months 

## An eight-month-old is curious about everything, but he also has a very short attention span and 

## will move rapidly from one activity to the next. Two to three minutes is the most he’ll spend with 

## a single toy, and then he’ll turn to something new. By twelve months, he may be willing to sit for as 

## long as fifteen minutes with a particularly interesting plaything, but most of the time he’ll still be 

## a body in motion, and you shouldn’t expect him to be any different. 

## Ironically, although toy stores are brimming with one expensive plaything after another, the toys 

## that fascinate children most at this age are ordinary household objects such as wooden spoons, 

## egg cartons, and plastic containers of all shapes and sizes. Your baby will be especially interested 

## in things that differ just a bit from what he already knows, so if he’s bored with the oatmeal box he’s been playing with, 

## you can renew his interest by putting a ball inside or turning it into a pull toy by tying a short string to it. These small 

## changes will help him learn to detect small differences between the familiar and the unfamiliar. Also, when you 

## choose playthings, remember that objects too much like what he’s seen before will be given a quick once-over and 

## dismissed, while things that are too foreign may be confusing or frightening. Look instead for objects and toys that 

## gradually help him expand his horizons. 

## Often your baby won’t need your help to discover objects that fall into this middle ground of newness. In fact, as soon 

## as he can crawl, he’ll be off in search of new things to conquer. He’ll rummage through your drawers, empty out 

## wastebaskets, ransack kitchen cabinets, and conduct elaborate experiments on everything he finds. (Make sure 

## there’s nothing that can hurt him in those containers, and keep an eye on him whenever he’s into these things.) He’ll 

## never tire of dropping, rolling, throwing, submerging, or waving objects to find out how they behave. This may look 

## like random play to you, but it’s your child’s way of finding out how the world works. Like any good scientist, he’s 

## observing the properties of objects, and from his observations, he’ll develop ideas about shapes (some things roll and 

## others don’t), textures (things can be scratchy, soft, or smooth), and sizes (some things fit inside each other). He’ll even 

## begin to understand that some things are edible and others aren’t, although he’ll still put everything into his mouth 

## just to be sure. (Again, make sure there’s nothing dangerous lying around that he can put in his mouth.) 

## His continuing observations during these months also will help him understand that objects exist even when they’re 

## out of his sight. This concept is called object permanence. At eight months, when you hide a toy under a scarf, he’ll 

## pick up the scarf and search for the toy underneath—a response that wouldn’t have occurred three months earlier. 

## Try hiding the toy under the scarf and then removing it when he’s not looking, however, and your eight-month-old will 

## be puzzled. By ten months, he’ll be so certain that the toy still exists that he’ll continue looking for it. To help your baby 

## learn object permanence, play peekaboo with him. By switching from one variation of this game to another, you’ll 

## maintain his interest almost indefinitely. 

## As he approaches his first birthday, your child will become increasingly conscious that things not only have names but 

## that they also have particular functions. You’ll see this new awareness weave itself into his play as a very early form of 

## fantasy. For example, instead of treating a toy telephone as an interesting object to be chewed, poked, and banged, he’ll 

## put the receiver to his ear just as he’s seen you do. You can encourage important developmental activities like this by 

## offering him suggestive props—a hairbrush, toothbrush, cup, or spoon—and by being an enthusiastic audience for his 

## performances.
