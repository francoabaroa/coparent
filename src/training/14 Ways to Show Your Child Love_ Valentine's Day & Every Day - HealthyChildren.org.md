# 14 Ways to Show Your Child Love: Valentine's Day & Every 

# Day 

## 1. Have Heart-to-Heart Conversations 

## Ask your child "How was your day?" and actively listen to the answer. Be available when your child wants 

## to talk, even if it's not the best time for you. If they tell you about a challenge they are facing, let them 

## finish the story before helping them solve the problem. More than a year after the American Academy of 

## Pediatrics (AAP) joined with other organizations to declare a national emergency 

## (https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/clinical-guidance/interim

## guidance-on-supporting-the-emotional-and-behavioral-health-needs-of-children-adolescents-and

## families-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/) in youth mental health, many kids are still struggling. If you see 

## signs of anxiety or depression (/English/health-issues/conditions/COVID-19/Pages/Signs-your-Teen

## May-Need-More-Support.aspx) talk with your pediatrician. For more information, see How to Talk About 

## Mental Health With Your Child and Their Pediatrician (/English/healthy-living/emotional

## wellness/Pages/How-to-Talk-with-Your-Child-and-Their-Pediatrician-About-Mental-Health

## Concerns.aspx). 

## 2. Hold Time Together Dear 


### Mark game nights or other family activities on your calendar so that everyone can look forward to 

### enjoying time together. With cold winter weather (/English/safety-prevention/at-play/Pages/Winter

### Safety.aspx) and the ongoing spread of repiratory viruses (/English/health-issues/conditions/COVID

### 19/Pages/How-is-the-Flu-Different-From-COVID-19.aspx), take the opportunity to spend more time at 

### home playing (/English/family-life/power-of-play/Pages/Indoor-Play-Ideas-winter.aspx) and connecting 

### as a family. Also be sure to carve out one-on-one time with each of your children regularly to do 

### something they enjoy. Put away cell phones, tablets and other media 

### (/English/media/Pages/default.aspx) devices during these special times and really focus on each other. 

## 3. Share the Love of Reading 

### Start reading (/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/school/Pages/10-Tips-to-Help-Your-Child-Fall-in-Love

### with-Reading.aspx) to your child beginning in infancy. Many studies show that reading together 

### strengthens parent-child bonds and promotes positive parenting. Plus, when you read to or with your 

### child, you help them build a foundation for success in school (/English/news/Pages/Pediatricians

### Prescribe-Plan-to-Boost-School-Attendance.aspx), which is linked to long-term wellness.

## 4. Think Hugs First 

### When your child is angry (/English/healthy-living/emotional-wellness/Pages/Staying-Cool-When

### Things-Heat-Up.aspx), grouchy or in a bad mood, try not to take it personally. Calm your own emotions 

### first, perhaps by taking a deep breath, and then give a quick hug, cuddle, pat, secret nod or other sign of 

### affection. Once they are also calm and feeling better, consider talking with them about the event and how 

### they might better manage those strong emotions next time. 

## 5. Embrace Health & Safety 

### Show how much you care by taking your children to the doctor regularly for well-child care visits 

### (/English/family-life/health-management/pages/Well-Child-Care-A-Check-Up-for-Success.aspx). Make 

### sure they are up-to-date on vaccines to protect them against infectious diseases, including COVID-19 

### (/English/tips-tools/ask-the-pediatrician/Pages/when-can-children-get-the-COVID-19-vaccine.aspx), flu 

### (/English/health-issues/conditions/flu/Pages/which-flu-vaccine-should-my-child-get-this-year.aspx), 

### and other recommended immunizations (/English/safety

### prevention/immunizations/Pages/Recommended-Immunization-Schedules.aspx). Teach them how to be 

#### Back to Top 


### safe from injuries, provide a healthy and nutritious diet, and encourage good amounts of sleep 

### (/English/healthy-living/sleep/Pages/default.aspx) and exercise (/English/healthy

### living/fitness/Pages/Energy-Out-Daily-Physical-Activity-Recommendations.aspx) to help them grow 

### healthy and strong. Create a safe home (/english/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/default.aspx) 

### environment, and use seat belts or car seats (/English/safety-prevention/on-the-go/Pages/Car-Safety

### Seats-Information-for-Families.aspx) every time you are in a vehicle. 

## 6. Discipline With Love 

### Use positive, non-violent discipline (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/communication

### discipline/Pages/Disciplining-Your-Child.aspx). Harsh physical and verbal punishments don't work and 

### can damage long-term physical and mental health. From an early age, explain clear and consistent rules 

### that your children can understand. Give praise when they follow them—not just punishment when they 

### don't. Calmly (/English/health-issues/conditions/COVID-19/Pages/Parenting-in-a-Pandemic.aspx) 

### explain consequences and follow through right away when rules are broken. 

## 7. Choose Words with Care 

#### Back to Top 


### Use plenty of positive and encouraging words when talking with your child. Model consideration and 

### gratitude by saying “please" and "thank you." Skip the sarcasm, mockery and put-downs, even if teasing. 

### Children often don't understand your purpose. Even if they do, these messages can harm self-esteem 

### (/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/Helping-Your-Child-Develop-A-Healthy-Sense-of-Self

### Esteem.aspx) and create negative ways of talking and connecting with each other. 

## 8. Care for the Earth 

### Spend time together in nature when you can, exploring ways to appreciate and protect it. Taking steps to 

### care for the environment will show your children how you care about their future. Many children and 

### teens hear about or experience climate-change-fueled disasters such as wildfires (/English/safety

### prevention/at-home/Pages/Wildfires-Information-for-Parents.aspx) and severe storms (/English/safety

### prevention/all-around/Pages/climate-change-extreme-weather-and-children-what-families-need-to

### know.aspx). Talk with them about their concerns in a way that is honest, hopeful, developmentally 

### appropriate, and solution oriented. For tips, see Talking With Children About Climate Change 

### (/English/safety-prevention/all-around/Pages/Talking-with-Children-about-Climate-Change.aspx). 

## 9. Forgive Mistakes, Including Your Own 

#### Back to Top 


### If you lose your cool and react harshly to your child, apologize and explain how you will handle the 

### situation in the future. Be sure to keep your promise. Also forgive yourself. No one is perfect. 

### Understanding how to forgive is important for your child to accept their own mistakes (/English/family

### life/family-dynamics/Pages/A-Perfect-Parent.aspx) as well, and build confidence (/English/family

### life/Community/Pages/Contribution-Building-Competence-Confidence-Connection-Character.aspx) 

### and resilience (/English/health-issues/conditions/COVID-19/Pages/Building-Resilience-in-Uncertain

### Times.aspx). 

## 10. Cook & Eat Together 

### One of the best ways to teach your children about good food choices (/English/ages

### stages/gradeschool/nutrition/Pages/Making-Healthy-Food-Choices.aspx) and enjoy each other's 

### company is to cook together. Involve them in the entire process, from planning the menus to shopping 

### for ingredients to preparing and serving the meal. Family meals are a great opportunity to talk and 

### connect. Put away any electronic devices, including your own phone. 

#### Back to Top 


## 11. Foster Friendships 

### Help your child develop positive relationships with friends (/English/family-life/work-play/Pages/what

### parents-can-do-to-support-friendships.aspx), siblings and members of the community (/English/family

### life/Community/Pages/Creating-Opportunities-for-Children-Teens-to-Contribute.aspx). Teach them 

### about the value of kindness (/English/healthy-living/emotional-wellness/Building

### Resilience/Pages/Kindness-Can-Make-a-Big-Difference.aspx). Encourage your child to be involved in 

### activities that require teamwork, such as sports (/English/health-issues/conditions/COVID

### 19/Pages/Youth-Sports-and-COVID-19-Understanding-the-Risks.aspx). Get to know your child's friends 

### and talk about responsible and respectful relationships (/English/healthy-living/emotional

### wellness/Pages/Your-Childs-First-Crush.aspx). 

## 12. Make Room in Your Heart for a Pet 

#### Back to Top 


### Consider adopting a pet (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/Before-Choosing-a-Pet.aspx) if 

### possible. Having a pet can help make some children, especially those with chronic illnesses 

### (/English/health-issues/conditions/chronic/Pages/Coping-With-Chronic-Illness.aspx) and disabilities, 

### feel better by increasing their physical activity, enhancing their overall positive feelings, and offering 

### another way to connect with someone they care about. 

## 13. Tell Your Child You Love Them No Matter Who They Love 

### Tell your teen they can talk with you about any crushes (/English/healthy-living/emotional

### wellness/Pages/Your-Childs-First-Crush.aspx) they may have. This is a good opportunity to talk about 

### dating, relationships, gender identity (/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/gender-diverse

#### Back to Top 


### transgender-children.aspx) and sexual activity. We can make sure our children understand how to 

### respect their bodies and others, that "no means no." 

## 14. Share These 3 Words Without Limit 

### Remember, all children want their parent's attention, no matter their age. Make time every day to talk. 

### Young people are more likely to make healthy choices if they stay connected with family members. 

### And don't forget to say "I love you" to your children on February 14—and many more times as they grow 

### up. They are never too old to hear it.
