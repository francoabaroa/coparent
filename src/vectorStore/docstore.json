But, have \n\n## you ever noticed how kids tend to have fun with things \n\n## as simple as a cardboard box? It's true. \n\n## Getting back to basics \n\n## The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) report \n\n## (http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/129/1/e2 \n\n## 04.full) on the importance of play explains that \n\n## inexpensive toys such as blocks, balls, jump ropes and \n\n## buckets are often the best kind for kids. In fact, they're more effective in allowing children to be imaginative and \n\n## creative than more expensive toys that may be out of reach for many parents. \n\n## So, why not take that cardboard box and play with them? More than any material gift, YOU are the best toy your \n\n## child will ever receive! \n\n## Not just kids' stuff \n\n## While it may be hard to relax and give yourself over to play, view this time with your child as an adventure. You are not \n\n## only promoting the many benefits of play (/English/ages-stages/toddler/fitness/Pages/Young-Children-Learn-A-Lot\n\n## When-They-Play.aspx), but also getting to know your child better and strengthening the parent-child bond. For \n\n## starters, your role can actually be quite minimal and the play you undertake can be almost any activity. \n\n## Here are a dozen old-school play ideas that your preschooler will adore. \n\n## Bonus: You don't need much time or expensive lessons or toys to participate in any of the activities listed! \n\n## 1. Duck, Duck, Goose: Everyone sits in a circle. One child is \"It\" and goes around the circle tapping everyone on the \n\n## head and saying, \"Duck.\" At this child's discretion, he or she taps someone and calls out \"Goose.\" At the moment, \n\n## the child tapped must jump up and chase the child who was \"It\" around the circle of kids. If the child who was \"It\"","metadata":{"id":0}}],["1",{"pageContent":"## the child tapped must jump up and chase the child who was \"It\" around the circle of kids. If the child who was \"It\" \n\n## makes it around the circle and sits down, then he or she is \"safe.\" If tagged by the \"Goose,\" then he or she is out. \n\n## Either way, the Goose is now \"It\" and the game resumes. Eventually, only two children are left. The last child left \n\n## without being tagged wins. \n\n## 2. London Bridge is Falling Down: Two children form a bridge by joining hands across from each other. As \n\n## everyone sings the nursery rhyme, all the children pass under the up stretched arms. When the song ends, the \n\n## arms are dropped around the child passing through at the time. Then, the song changes to, \"Take the key and lock \n\n## him up.\" Those joining hands can start rocking arms back and forth. Preschoolers delight in being \"locked up\" \n\n## and swayed to and fro. \n\n## 3. Limbo: Bring a broom stick outside and ask two older children or adults hold the ends. Have the children go \n\n## under the stick without touching it. If the stick is touched, then that child is out. After everyone has had a turn, \n\n## the stick can be gradually lowered in increments. This can be done to music, too, if available. \n\n## 4. Egg Races: Make some hard boiled eggs and bring them outside with some tablespoons. Have fun telling your \n\n## preschooler where they have to walk, run, jump, etc., while balancing the egg on the spoon. This promotes \n\n## balance and dexterity. \n\n\n#### 5. Simon Says: This is one of the most popular games for young children to play. It encourages good listening skills \n\n### and focus. You are Simon. Stand facing your children and give orders, such as \"Simon says to touch your nose\" or \n\n### \"Simon says to do a jumping jack.\" As you call out each order, the children must do whatever you do, as long as \n\n### you have said, \"Simon Says.\" If you just say, \"Do this,\" whoever follows the action that you now do, is out. The last \n\n#### child standing wins.","metadata":{"id":1}}],["2",{"pageContent":"### you have said, \"Simon Says.\" If you just say, \"Do this,\" whoever follows the action that you now do, is out. The last \n\n#### child standing wins. \n\n#### 6. Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes: You sing the tune and control the pace. Children have to touch the body part \n\n#### being mentioned, as it is mentioned. You can speed up the pace of the tune, and your child has to move faster and \n\n#### faster to keep up. It can get pretty funny as everyone tries to touch their knees and toes as fast as possible. \n\n#### 7. Nature walks: You can turn literally any walk outside into a nature walk—even a walk around the block. Observe \n\n### the weather, animals, bugs, and plants. You might say, \"Look at those big clouds,\" or \"Touch this grass. It is still wet \n\n### from yesterday's rain.\" Preschoolers especially love exploring and are sure to have plenty of questions for you \n\n#### along the way! \n\n#### 8. Follow the Leader: Move all around doing different movements. Everyone has to do what you do. Simple. Great. \n\n#### Fun! \n\n#### 9. Tag: You can be \"It\" for starters. Everyone tries to catch you and tag you. If you are tagged, then that child gets to \n\n#### be \"It.\" Some designated spots can be considered \"safe,\" like all the trees, or park benches, etc. This is a great \n\n#### excuse to just run around! \n\n### 10. Run Around: You can be \"It\" and call out things for everyone to do. For example, \"Run from this tree to that tree,\" \n\n### or \"Hop on one foot from this bench to that tree.\" There are endless suggestions—you will probably run out of \n\n#### ideas before your preschooler gets bored! \n\n## Remember \n\n#### While you may find many opportunities to capitalize on \"teachable moments\" during these activities, the key is to do \n\n#### what comes naturally to you as a parent. Playing together shouldn't be a chore or something you feel pressure to do. \n\n#### Enjoy the time you spend with your child.

After the rapid growth of infancy, when babies usually triple in weight, a toddler’s growth rate (/English/ages-stages/toddler/nutrition/Pages/serving-sizes-fortoddlers.aspx) – and appetite – tends to slow down. \n\n Toddlers also are beginning to develop food preferences (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/How-Children-DevelopUnhealthy-Food-Preferences.aspx), a fickle process. A toddler’s favorite food one day may hit the floor the next, or a snubbed food might suddenly become the one he or she can’t get enough of. For weeks, they may eat 1 or 2 preferred foods – and nothing else. \n\n Try not to get frustrated by this typical toddler behavior. Just make healthy food choices (/English/agesstages/toddler/nutrition/pages/Sample-One-Day-Menu-for-a-Two-Year-Old.aspx) available and know that, with time, your child's appetite and eating behaviors will level out. In the meantime, here are some tips that can help you get through the picky eater stage. \n\n**1. Family style**. Share a meal together as a family (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/Pages/Mealtime-as-Family- Time.aspx) as often as you can. This means no media (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/Food-and-TV-Not-a-Healthy- Mix.aspx) distractions like TV or cell phones at mealtime. Use this time to model healthy eating. Serve one meal for the whole family and resist the urge to make another meal if your child refuses what you've served. This only encourages picky eating. Try to include at least one food your child likes with each meal and continue to provide a balanced meal, whether she eats it or not.","metadata":{"id":9}}],["10",{"pageContent":"**2. Food fights**. If your toddler refuses a meal, avoid fussing over it. It’s good for children to learn to listen to their bodies and use hunger as a guide. If they ate a big breakfast or lunch (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/How- To-Please-Fussy-Eaters.aspx), for example, they may not be interested in eating much the rest of the day. It's a parent's responsibility to provide food, and the child’s decision to eat it. Pressuring kids to eat, or punishing them if they don't, can make them actively dislike foods they may otherwise like. \n\n**3. Break from bribes**. Tempting as it may be, try not to bribe (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Tips-for- Preventing-Food-Hassles.aspx) your children with treats for eating other foods. This can make the \"prize\" food even more exciting, and the food you want them to try an unpleasant chore. It also can lead to nightly battles at the dinner table. \n\n**4. Try, try again**. Just because a child refuses a food once, don't give up. Keep offering new foods and those your child didn't like before. It can take as many as 10 or more times tasting a food before a toddler’s taste buds accept it. Scheduled meals and limiting snacks (/English/ages-stages/toddler/nutrition/Pages/Selecting-Snacks-for- Toddlers.aspx) can help ensure your child is hungry when a new food is introduced. \n\n**5. Variety: the spice**. Offer a variety of healthy foods, especially vegetables and fruits, and include higher protein foods like meat and deboned fish (/English/safety-prevention/all-around/Pages/Protecting-Your-Children-From- Contaminated-Fish.aspx) at least 2 times per week. Help your child explore new flavors and textures in food. Try adding different herbs and spices to simple meals to make them tastier. To minimize waste, offer new foods in small amounts and wait at least a week or two before reintroducing the same food.","metadata":{"id":10}}],["11",{"pageContent":"**6. Make food fun**. Toddlers are especially open to trying foods arranged in eye-catching, creative ways. Make foods look irresistible by arranging them in fun, colorful shapes kids can recognize. Kids this age also tend to enjoy any food involving a dip. Finger foods are also usually a hit with toddlers. Cut solid foods into bite size pieces they can easily eat themselves, making sure the pieces are small enough to avoid the risk of choking (/English/health-issues/injuries- emergencies/Pages/Choking-Prevention.aspx). \n\n\n3/9/23, 12:46 PM 10 Tips for Parents of Picky Eaters HealthyChildren.org \n\nhttps://healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/nutrition/Pages/Picky-Eaters.aspx 2/2 \n\n**7. Involve kids in meal planning**. Put your toddler's growing interest in exercising control to good use. Let you child pick which fruit and vegetable (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/How-to-Get-Your-Child-to-Eat-More-Fruits- and-Veggies.aspx) to make for dinner or during visits to the grocery store or farmer's market. Read kid-friendly cookbooks together and let your child pick out new recipes to try. \n\n**8. Tiny chefs**. Some cooking (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Cooking-With-Your-Children.aspx) tasks are perfect for toddlers (with lots of supervision, of course): sifting, stirring, counting ingredients, picking fresh herbs from a garden or windowsill, and “painting” on cooking oil with a pastry brush, to name a few. \n\n**9. Crossing bridges**. Once a food is accepted, use what nutritionists call \"food bridges\" to introduce others with similar color, flavor and texture to help expand variety in what your child will eat. If your child likes pumpkin pie, for example, try mashed sweet potatoes and then mashed carrots.","metadata":{"id":11}}],["12",{"pageContent":"**10. A fine pair**. Try serving unfamiliar foods, or flavors young children tend to dislike at first (sour and bitter), with familiar foods toddlers naturally prefer (sweet and salty). Pairing broccoli (bitter) with grated cheese (salty), for example, is a great combination for toddler taste buds. \n\n## Remember... \n\n If you are concerned about your child’s diet, talk with your pediatrician, who can help troubleshoot and make sure your child is getting all the necessary nutrients to grow and develop. Also keep in mind that picky eating usually is a normal developmental stage for toddlers.

But, there are other \n\n## times when it probably drives you a little crazy. As a \n\n## toddler or preschooler, your child may lack the self\n\n## control to express anger peacefully and may naturally \n\n## lash out, perhaps hitting or biting in frustration. \n\n## While occasional outbursts are \n\n## normal―especially during \n\n## temper tantrums \n\n## (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/communication\n\n## discipline/Pages/Temper-Tantrums.aspx)―there are things you can \n\n## do to shape your child's behavior. \n\n## 1. Teach the house rules. Children don't know the rules of the house until they're taught them, so that is one of \n\n## your important parenting responsibilities. Toddlers are normally interested in touching and exploring, so if there \n\n## are valuables you don't want them to handle, hide or remove them. Consider setting up a separate portion of your \n\n## home where your child can play with books and toys. Whenever children break an important rule, they should \n\n## be reprimanded immediately to understand exactly what they have done wrong. \n\n## 2. Threats are over-rated. It is always more effective to positively reinforce desired behaviors and to teach \n\n## children alternative behaviors rather than just say, \"Stop it or else.\" Tell them that the next time they are angry, \n\n## they should use their words instead. \n\n## 3. Enter healthy distractions. While teaching your child other ways to respond, there's also nothing wrong with \n\n## distracting him at times or trying another approach. As long as you're not \"bribing\" him to behave differently by \n\n## offering sweet snacks. For example, there's nothing wrong with intentionally changing his focus. \n\n## 4. \"Control yourself.\" Well, they can't yet. Remember, toddlers have little natural self-control. They need you to \n\n## teach them not to kick, hit, or bite when they are angry, but instead to express their feelings through words.","metadata":{"id":13}}],["14",{"pageContent":"## teach them not to kick, hit, or bite when they are angry, but instead to express their feelings through words. \n\n## 5. \"We don't hurt each other.\" Supervise your child carefully when she is involved in disputes with playmates. If a \n\n## disagreement is minor, keep your distance and let the children solve it on their own. However, you must \n\n## intervene when children get into a physical fight that continues even after they're told to stop, or when one child \n\n## seems to be in an uncontrollable rage and is assaulting or biting the other. Pull the children apart and keep them \n\n## separate until they have calmed down. If the fight is extremely violent, you may have to end the play session. \n\n## Make it clear that it doesn't matter who \"started it.\" There is no excuse for trying to hurt each other. \n\n## 6. Instead of fighting. Teach your child to say \"no\" in a firm tone of voice, to turn his back, or to find compromises \n\n## instead of fighting with his body. Through example, you are teaching your child to settle differences with words— \n\n## more effective and more civilized—than with physical violence. \n\n## 7. \"Great job!\" Praise your child for appropriate behavior and help explain how \"grown-up\" she is acting whenever \n\n## she uses these tactics instead of hitting, kicking, or biting. And always reinforce and praise behavior when you \n\n## catch your child being kind and gentle. \n\n## 8. Time-outs are OK. There's also nothing wrong with using a time-out when your child's behavior is inappropriate, \n\n## and they can be used in children as young as one year old. See How to Give a Time-Out (/English/family\n\n## life/family-dynamics/communication-discipline/Pages/Time-Outs-101.aspx) for more information. \n\n\n### 9. Control your own temper.

If you must discipline your child, do not feel guilty about it and certainly don't apologize. If your \n\n### child senses your mixed feelings, he will convince himself that he was in the right all along and you are the \"bad\" \n\n### one.

When you discipline, \n\n### you should provide your child with praise along with instruction in a firm tone, with the intent of improving his \n\n### or her behavior. \n\n### Punishment is a negative, in which you're dispensing an unpleasant consequence when your child does or \n\n### doesn't do something. Punishment is a part of discipline, but only a small part. \n\n### Until age three and sometimes later, children simply don't understand the concept of punishment. Setting \n\n### limits is a much better approach than punishment; most children will respond to clear, calm, and decisive \n\n### limit-setting. \n\n## When to call the pediatrician \n\n### If your child seems to be unusually aggressive for longer than a few weeks, and you cannot cope with his behavior on \n\n### your own, consult your pediatrician.

If you notice any of the following in your baby, contact your pediatrician. \n\n## Abdominal distension \n\nMost babies' bellies normally stick out, especially after a large feeding. Between feedings, however, they should feel soft. If your child's abdomen feels swollen and hard, and if she has not had a bowel movement for more than one or two days or is vomiting, call your pediatrician. Most likely the problem is due to gas or constipation, but it also could signal a more serious intestinal problem. \n\n## Birth injuries \n\nBabies can be injured during birth, especially if labor is long or difficult, or when babies are very large. While newborns recover quickly from some of these injuries, others persist. Occasionally a broken collarbone occurs, which will heal quickly. After a few weeks a small lump may form at the fracture site, but don't be alarmed; this is a sign that new bone is forming to mend the injury, and it will soon be as good as new. Muscle weakness is another common birth injury during labor, caused by pressure or stretching of the nerves attached to the muscles. These muscles, usually weakened on one side of the face or one shoulder or arm, generally return to normal after several weeks. In the meantime, ask your pediatrician to show you how to nurse and hold the baby to promote healing. \n\n## Blue baby \n\nBabies may have mildly blue or purple hands and feet, which is usually normal. If their hands and feet turn slightly blue from cold, they should return to pink as soon as they are warm. Occasionally the face, tongue, and lips may turn a little blue when the newborn is crying hard, but once she is calm, her color should quickly return to normal. However, persistently blue skin coloring is a sign the heart or lungs are not operating properly. and the baby is not getting enough oxygen in the blood. Immediate medical attention is essential.","metadata":{"id":18}}],["19",{"pageContent":"## Unusual bowel movements \n\n**Meconium.** After birth, the staff will watch for your baby's first urination and bowel movement to make sure she has no problem with these important tasks. It may be delayed twenty-four hours or more. The first bowel movement or two will be black or dark green and very slimy. It is meconium, a substance that fills the infant's intestines before she is born. If your baby does not pass meconium in the first forty-eight hours, further evaluation is required to make sure that no problems exist in the lower bowel. **Blood in stool.** On occasion, newborns have a little blood in their bowel movements. If it occurs during the first few days, it usually means the infant has a little crack in the anus from stooling. This is generally harmless, but even so, let your pediatrician know about any signs of blood to confirm the reason, since there are other causes that require further evaluation and treatment. \n\n## Coughing \n\nIf the baby drinks very fast, she may cough and sputter; but this type of coughing should stop as soon as her feeding routine becomes familiar. This may also be related to how strongly or fast a breastfeeding mom's milk comes down. If she coughs persistently or routinely gags during feedings, consult the pediatrician. These symptoms could indicate an underlying problem in the lungs or digestive tract. \n\n\n## Excessive crying","metadata":{"id":19}}],["20",{"pageContent":"## Excessive crying \n\nAll newborns cry, often for no apparent reason. If you've made sure that your baby is fed, burped, warm, and dressed in a clean diaper, the best tactic is probably to hold her and talk or sing to her until she stops. You cannot spoil a baby this age by giving her too much attention. If this doesn't work, wrap her snugly (/English/ages-stages/baby/diapersclothing/Pages/swaddling-is-it-safe.aspx) in a blanket or try some other ways that may help calm your baby (/English/ages-stages/baby/crying-colic/Pages/Calming-A-Fussy-Baby.aspx). You'll become accustomed to your baby's patterns of crying. If it ever sounds peculiar—such as shrieks of pain—or if it persists for an unusual length of time, it could mean a medical problem. Call the pediatrician and ask for advice. \n\n## Forceps marks \n\nWhen forceps are used during delivery, they can leave red marks or even superficial scrapes on a newborn's face and head. These generally disappear within a few days. Sometimes a firm, flat lump develops in one of these areas because of minor damage to the tissue under the skin, but this, too, will usually go away within two months. \n\n## Jaundice","metadata":{"id":20}}],["21",{"pageContent":"## Jaundice \n\nMany normal, healthy newborns have a yellowish tinge to their skin, which is known as jaundice (/English/agesstages/baby/Pages/jaundice.aspx). It is caused by a buildup of bilirubin in the child's blood. Mild jaundice is harmless. However, if the bilirubin level continues to rise and is not treated, it can lead to brain injury. Jaundice tends to be more common in breastfed newborns, most often in those not nursing well; breastfeeding mothers should nurse at least eight to twelve times per day, which will produce enough milk and keep bilirubin levels low. Jaundice first appears on the face, then the chest and abdomen, and finally the arms and legs in some instances. The whites of the eyes may also be yellow. Most hospitals now routinely screen newborns for jaundice twenty-four hours after birth using a painless handheld light meter. If the pediatrician suspects jaundice may be present—based on skin color as well as the baby's age and other factors—she may order a skin or blood test to definitively diagnose the condition. If jaundice develops before the baby is twenty-four hours old, a bilirubin test is always needed to make an accurate diagnosis. If you notice a sudden increase in jaundice when your baby is at home, contact your pediatrician. \n\n## Lethargy & sleepiness \n\nEvery newborn spends most of her time sleeping. As long as she wakes every few hours, eats well, seems content, and is alert part of the day, it's perfectly normal to sleep the rest of the time. But if she's rarely alert, does not wake up on her own for feedings, or seems too tired or uninterested to eat, you should consult your pediatrician. This lethargy— especially if it's a sudden change in her usual pattern—may be a symptom of a serious illness. \n\n## Respiratory distress","metadata":{"id":21}}],["22",{"pageContent":"## Respiratory distress \n\nIt may take your baby a few hours after birth to form a normal breathing pattern, but then she should have no further difficulties. If she seems to be breathing in an unusual manner, it is most often due to blocked nasal passages. Using saline nasal drops, followed by suctioning the mucus from the nose with a bulb syringe, may fix the problem; both are available over the counter. However, if your newborn shows any of the following warning signs, notify your pediatrician immediately: Fast breathing (more than sixty breaths in one minute), although keep in mind that babies normally breathe more rapidly than adults Retractions (sucking in the muscles between the ribs with each breath, so that her ribs stick out) Flaring of her nose Grunting while breathing Persistent blue skin coloring \n\n## Umbilical cord problems \n\n**Umbilical stump bleeding.** As you're caring for your baby's umbilical cord (/English/ages-stages/baby/bathing-skincare/Pages/Umbilical-Cord-Care.aspx), you may notice a few drops of blood on the diaper around the time the stump falls off. This is normal. But if the cord actively bleeds, call your baby's doctor immediately. If the stump becomes infected, it will require medical treatment. Although cord infections are uncommon, you should contact your doctor if you notice any of the following: Back to Top","metadata":{"id":22}}],["23",{"pageContent":"Foul-smelling yellowish discharge from the cord Red skin around the base of the cord Crying when you touch the cord or the skin next to it **Umbilical granuloma.** Sometimes instead of completely drying, the cord will form a granuloma or a small, reddened mass of scar tissue that stays on the belly button after the umbilical cord has fallen off. This granuloma will drain a light-yellowish fluid. This condition will usually go away in about a week, but if not, your pediatrician may need to burn off (cauterize) the granulomatous tissue. **Umbilical hernia.** If your baby's umbilical cord area seems to push outward when she cries, she may have an umbilical hernia (/English/health-issues/conditions/abdominal/Pages/umbilical-hernia-in-children.aspx)—a small hole in the muscular part of the abdominal wall that allows the tissue to bulge out when there is increased abdominal pressure (i.e., crying). This is not a serious condition, and it usually heals by itself in the first twelve to eighteen months. (For unknown reasons it often takes longer to heal in African American babies.) In the unlikely event it doesn't heal by three to five years of age, the hole may need surgery. Don't put tape or a coin on the navel. It will not help the hernia, and it may cause a skin rash. **Last Updated** 3 / 1 2/ 2021 **Source** Caring for Your Baby and Young Child: Birth to Age 5 7 th Edition (Copyright © 2019 American Academy of Pediatrics) The information contained on this Web site should not be used as a substitute for the medical care and advice of your pediatrician.

In fact, play therapy is one of the treatment (/English/health\n\n## issues/conditions/emotional-problems/Pages/depression-in-children-and-teens-treatment-options.aspx) tools used \n\n## by behavioral health experts when they work with children. \n\n## Read on for a few ways play can help you boost your child's mood at home. \n\n## 1. Let kids lead the way in play \n\n## One of the things parents tend to do when their kids get grumpy or defiant is to micro-manage more. But \n\n## part of a young child's normal emotional development (/English/ages-stages/toddler/Pages/Emotional\n\n## Development-2-Year-Olds.aspx), especially by about age 2, is struggling to gain more control their actions, \n\n## impulses, feelings and their body. This can become frustrating for them at times. \n\n## Play, on the other hand, lets your child feel more in control. You can just sit back and observe. Turn off \n\n## digital distractions, bring out whatever your child is in the mood to play with (crayons, blocks, action \n\n## figures, whatever!) and don't direct the play. It's ok to ask questions, or say things like, \"Oh that's cool!\" or \n\n## \"What can I draw?\" but try to notice when you want to jump in and control things, and resist that urge. \n\n\n## 2. Focus on bringing out the smiles \n\n### One of the best things about play is the natural joy that can come from being silly together, popping \n\n### bubbles, chasing and tickling or telling jokes. You don’t need to demand that your child join you—you \n\n### can start without them and let them choose to join in (this way, they feel in more control).

Make identifying emotions a game \n\n#### Back to Top \n\n\n### One activity to try is drawing a grid with 4 zones and a circle in each of them. Then, turn the circles into \n\n### faces with different emotions. Let your child help you draw the faces, identify the feelings and list a few \n\n### things that make them feel that way.

These early education activities we're talking about are simple―and screen free! \n\n The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends (https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/138/3/e20162293) parents talk with their pediatrician about how to create a supportive, stimulating environment for their baby―starting at birth―that promotes healthy brain development and builds the social and emotional skills necessary for school readiness. \n\n## Use the \"5 Rs of Early Education\" in your daily activities right from \n\n## birth: \n\n## 1.

Talk with them about things they see around them, at home, at the store, or while traveling.

It also recommends that all advertising should be clearly labeled as “sponsored content.\" The AAP also calls for new laws to reduce advertising of unhealthy foods and beverages to children and young people, and ban images of tobacco products (including e-cigarettes). \n\n### What parents can do \n\n Ask your pediatrician for guidance and resources to learn about and teach your children digitial literacy. This means talking with them about how to identify, understand, and think critically about ads and marketing messages. \n\n For example, if a younger child asks to buy a specific brand or product, you can explore how advertising may have motivated them to want it. Other tips: \n\n Turn on and monitor privacy settings on personal devices, apps, social media, virtual assistants, and wireless networks. \n\n Create a Family Media Use Plan (/English/media/Pages/default.aspx) with your children to help guide them toward quality media content with fewer ads.

It sounds reasonable: \n\n## given that a baby's body temperature is 98.6°F and regular damp wipes are roughly 60°F, we're talking about a \n\n## 40°F difference. There are many options when it comes to choosing a wipe-warming unit—AC power adapter \n\n## and/or car charger, heat from the top or heat from the sides, a constant 104°F wipe temperature inside the unit, \n\n## built-in nightlights, and more.

Your child gets scheduled immunizations to prevent illness. You also can ask your pediatrician about nutrition and safety in the home and at school. \n\n Tracking growth & development. See how much your child has grown in the time since your last visit, and talk with your doctor about your child's development. You can discuss your child's milestones, social behaviors and learning. \n\n Raising any concerns. Make a list of topics you want to talk about with your child's pediatrician such as development, behavior, sleep, eating or getting along with other family members. Bring your top three to five questions or concerns with you to talk with your pediatrician at the start of the visit. \n\n Team approach. Regular visits create strong, trustworthy relationships among pediatrician, parent and child. The AAP recommends well-child visits as a way for pediatricians and parents to serve the needs of children. This team approach helps develop optimal physical, mental and social health of a child. \n\n## More information \n\n Back to School, Back to Doctor (/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/school/Pages/Back-to-School-Back-to-theDoctor.aspx) \n\n Recommended Immunization Schedules (/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/RecommendedImmunization-Schedules.aspx) \n\n Milestones Matter: 10 to Watch for by Age 5 (/English/family-life/health-management/Pages/MilestonesMatter.aspx) \n\n Your Child's Checkups (/English/ages-stages/Your-Childs-Checkups/Pages/default.aspx) \n\n Bright Futures/AAP Recommendations for Preventive Pediatric Health Care (periodicity schedule) (https://www.aap.org/en-us/Documents/periodicity_schedule.pdf)","metadata":{"id":77}}],["78",{"pageContent":"Bright Futures/AAP Recommendations for Preventive Pediatric Health Care (periodicity schedule) (https://www.aap.org/en-us/Documents/periodicity_schedule.pdf) \n\n Last Updated 3/6/2023 Source American Academy of Pediatrics (Copyright © 2018) The information contained on this Web site should not be used as a substitute for the medical care and advice of your pediatrician.

Simply wear a layer of clothing that opens down the front, and \n\n## sit behind the screen or with your back to the room. Don’t bother to dress your baby or wrap her in a blanket—all she \n\n## needs is a diaper because she will stay warm next to your body. You may notice that your infant tolerates these holding \n\n## sessions much better when they are not preceded by undressing, diaper changing, temperature taking, dressing again, \n\n## and swaddling in blankets.

As your alcohol blood level falls over time, the level \n\n## of alcohol in your breast milk will also decrease. Breast milk continues to contain alcohol if alcohol is still in your \n\n## bloodstream. \n\n## If You Choose to Have an Alcoholic Drink: \n\n## If you are going to have an alcohol containing beverage, it is best to \n\n## do so just after you nurse or pump milk rather than before. \n\n## Breastfeeding or pumping breast milk is ok 2 hours after your \n\n## last drink.

Sometimes, the cause is found, such as when \n\n## bedding or other items near them blocks breathing. \n\n## Other times, such as with sudden infant death syndrome \n\n## (SIDS), the exact cause can't be determined. But while we \n\n## don't yet know exactly what causes SIDS, also called \n\n## unexplained sudden death in infancy, there are some \n\n## risk factors we know about. \n\n## Types of SIDS risk factors \n\n## It important to know that risk factors are findings that are associated with an increased or decreased likelihood of \n\n## SIDS, but are not the cause of the death. Some risk factors, including many related to the sleep environment, can be \n\n## changed to lower your baby's risk. Other risk factors cannot be changed. \n\n## For example, babies who are born preterm (premature (/English/ages-stages/baby/preemie/Pages/default.aspx)) or \n\n## with a low birth weight (under 5 lbs. 8 oz.) are 2 to 3 times more likely to die of SIDS or other sleep-related deaths. We \n\n## also know that your baby is at higher risk if you smoked or drank alcohol during pregnancy. Recent research shows \n\n## that every cigarette smoked during pregnancy increases your baby's risk of SIDS. In fact, It has been estimated that, if \n\n## everyone stopped smoking during pregnancy, up to one-third of SIDS deaths could be avoided. \n\n## What other SIDS risk factors have been studied? \n\n## Interestingly, about 60% of the deaths occur in males and 40% in females. Age also plays an important role in SIDS and \n\n## sleep-related deaths. SIDS peaks between 1 and 4 months of age, and 90% of the cases take place in the first 6 months \n\n## of life.

Among many unique features you might \n\n## notice is a birthmark, a different-looking spot on the skin that a \n\n## baby is born with or develops soon after birth. \n\n## There are two main types of birthmarks: pigmented, spots of skin \n\n## that contain extra pigment (color); and vascular, which contain \n\n## extra blood vessels that didn't fully form. Both types are usually \n\n## harmless, and some go away on their own. But some need to be \n\n## watched to make sure they don't cause problems.

Signing with babies is based on the simple \n\n## observation that children can be taught to use their \n\n## hands to \"talk\" long before their mouths can catch up. \n\n## Using simple sign language with \n\n## your baby \n\n## Here are a few reasons why using simple sign language \n\n## with your child is worth considering: \n\n## Breaking the language barrier. From what we’ve seen in our own children and others (including in Laura’s \n\n## educational child care center), infant sign language really does deliver on its promise of improved \n\n## communication. This is a particularly appealing promise for new parents, given that there’s a well-recognized \n\n## gap between what babies and toddlers want to say and what they are capable of saying. \n\n## It only makes sense that young children who lack the verbal skills necessary to say what they want, feel, or need \n\n## experience frustration—especially in the period between 8 or 9 months (when babies start to really know what it \n\n## is they want) and 18 to 24 months (when they typically start to speak their mind). In other words, if basic sign \n\n## language can help babies use their hands to better express themselves at as early as 8 or 9 months, it can mean \n\n## the bridging of this otherwise months long communication gap. \n\n## Bonding fun. Signing with babies can also offer an opportunity for plenty of positive interaction, and anything \n\n## that increases parent baby bonding is a good thing in our book.

One creative idea we love: Start learning and \n\n## adding signs to your musical repertoire of popular baby songs such as \"Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star\" and \"Old \n\n## MacDonald Had a Farm.\" \n\n## Long story short, if you approach signing with your baby as an interactive and rewarding activity, then it’s \n\n## guaranteed to be all for fun and fun for all. In fact, if it’s not fun, then you shouldn’t be doing it. \n\n## Signs of the times: words with babies \n\n## There’s nothing wrong with teaching young children to \"recite\" the ABCs of sign language, but the most useful signs— \n\n## especially for infants and toddlers—are going to be those that convey more than just the letters of the alphabet. Signs \n\n## you’ll want to start with are those that are the most meaningful or serve to describe the things your baby most often \n\n## sees, does, or wants. \n\n## Here is a list of favorites we’ve put together in order to give you a better feel for some common signs of the early \n\n## childhood. Start by learning these and you’re sure to get the conversation started: airplane, baby, ball, bird, blanket, \n\n## book, cat, cup, cold, daddy, diaper, dog, done, drink, eat, go, good night, happy, help, hot, hurt, I love you, milk, mommy, \n\n## more, nap, no, outside, please, sit, sleep, star, thank you, up, water. \n\n## Tips for getting started \n\n## While signing isn’t exactly a must for new parents, it isn’t exactly difficult to learn, either. Books, videos, websites and \n\n## apps that handily address the basics of baby signing abound. It’s easy to see why so many parents swear by it, why \n\n## child care centers include it in their infant and toddler classrooms, and why it has become so commonplace as an \n\n## activity of daily learning. Here are some big-picture tips to get you started. \n\n\n##### 3/9/23, 11:19 AM Baby Sign Language: These Hands Were Made for Talking HealthyChildren.org","metadata":{"id":121}}],["122",{"pageContent":"## activity of daily learning.

The baby-signing trend is based on the observation that babies taught simple signs at 6 or 7 months \n\n#### of age could begin using them to communicate at as early as 8 or 9 months. While there’s no reason you have to \n\n#### wait until your baby turns 6 months to get started, we encourage you to be realistic in your expectations for any \n\n#### true signs of success. \n\n#### Speak up. Be sure you don’t cut back on the amount of time you spend talking with your baby. As long as signing \n\n#### does not take the place of speaking, it won’t get in the way of your baby’s learning to talk with her words as well as \n\n#### her hands. \n\n#### Make it a habit. As with much of the learning your baby will be doing, repetition is key. For a better shot at \n\n#### success, make signing a daily habit, not a one-time lesson. Use the same signs consistently. Tapping your fingers \n\n#### to your lips could convey \"eat,\" for example. Touching the left and right fingertips together can mean \"more.\" \n\n#### Sign what you see. Use signs to describe routine activities and common objects that make up your baby’s world. \n\n#### Don’t be heavy handed. Don’t worry if your baby doesn’t get the signs quite right or doesn’t pick them up right \n\n#### away. Remember the goal here is to have fun communicating and lessen frustration, not add to it. \n\n#### Share your signs. Be sure you share your signs with your baby’s other caregivers so that everyone can join in on \n\n#### and understand the conversation once your baby begins to sign.

That’s because the black, tarry-looking stuff, called meconium, is sterile. Until the intestines are colonized with bacteria, there’s nothing to make poop stinky. Don’t go bragging about your baby’s odorless poop, however; bacterial colonization begins with the first feeding. Some babies will actually pass meconium (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Babys-FirstDays-Bowel-Movements-and-Urination.aspx) while still in the uterus, usually as a result of physiologic stress like an infection or a difficult delivery (/english/ages-stages/prenatal/deliverybeyond/Pages/default.aspx). When this occurs, the baby is at risk for lung disease, called meconium aspiration syndrome. Your newborn will most likely have his first bowel movement some time in the first 24 hours of life. When stooling takes longer than this, doctors look for problems such as intestinal blockages, an underdeveloped anus, or stool that is stuck, called a meconium plug. \n\n Your newborn will continue to pass meconium over the first day or so, but if he is feeding well you’ll notice that over a few days the stool goes from black to dark green to yellow in color. Breastfed babies (/english/agesstages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/default.aspx) usually pass poop that looks like Dijon mustard, watery with little whitish seedylooking bits. Formula-fed babies (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/pages/Formula-Form-andFunction-Powders-Concentrates-and-Ready-to-Feed.aspx) may have less watery stool, usually pasty in consistency and yellow or tan in color. Many parents get concerned if they see the stool is green rather than yellow. In truth, all earth tones are fine, from yellow to green to brown. \n\n## When to Call the Doctor","metadata":{"id":132}}],["133",{"pageContent":"## When to Call the Doctor \n\n There are 2 colors stool should not be.

Here's what you can expect during your baby's first few days. \n\n## Urination \n\n Your baby (/English/agesstages/baby/Pages/default.aspx)may urinate as often as every one to three hours or as infrequently as four to six times a day. If they're ill or feverish (/English/healthissues/conditions/fever/Pages/default.aspx), or when the weather (/English/health-issues/injuriesemergencies/Pages/Extreme-TemperatureExposure.aspx) is extremely hot, their usual output of urine may drop by half and still be normal. \n\n Urination should never be painful. If you notice any signs of distress (/English/tips-tools/SymptomChecker/Pages/Urination-Pain.aspx) while your infant is urinating, notify your pediatrician. This could be a sign of infection (/English/health-issues/conditions/genitourinary-tract/Pages/Detecting-Urinary-Tract-Infections.aspx) or some other problem in the urinary tract. \n\n In a healthy child, urine is light to dark yellow in color. (The darker the color, the more concentrated the urine; the urine will be more concentrated when your child is not drinking a lot of liquid.) In the first week after birth, you may see a pink or brick-red stain on the diaper (/English/ages-stages/baby/diapers-clothing/Pages/default.aspx), often mistaken for blood. In fact, this stain is usually a sign of highly concentrated urine, which has a pinkish color. As long as the baby is wetting at least four diapers a day, there probably is no cause for concern. If the pinkish staining persists, consult your pediatrician.","metadata":{"id":134}}],["135",{"pageContent":"Newborn girls may have a small spot of blood in the diaper, also usually in the first week after birth; this blood is caused by her mother's hormones affecting the baby's uterus. After that time, however, the presence of actual blood in the urine or a bloody spot on the diaper is never normal, and your pediatrician should be notified. It may be due to nothing more serious than a small diaper rash (/English/tips-tools/Symptom-Checker/Pages/Diaper-Rash.aspx) sore, but it also could be a more serious problem. If this bleeding (/English/health-issues/injuriesemergencies/Pages/Acute-Bleeding.aspx) is accompanied by other symptoms, such as abdominal pain (/english/tipstools/symptom-checker/pages/Abdominal-Pain.aspx), poor feeding, vomiting, fever, or bleeding in other areas, seek medical attention immediately. \n\n## Bowel movements \n\n For the first few days after birth, your baby's first bowel movements (/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilettraining/Pages/Normal-Bowel-Movements.aspx) will be a substance known as meconium. This thick black or dark green substance filled their intestines before birth, and once passed, the stools turn yellow-green (/English/agesstages/baby/Pages/The-Many-Colors-of-Poop.aspx). \n\n Baby stools vary in color and consistency due to their immature digestive system. If your baby is breastfed (/english/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/default.aspx), their stools soon should be yellow liquid mixed with some particles. Until they start to eat solid foods (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Getting-Startedwith-Solid-Foods.aspx), the consistency of the stools may range from very soft to loose and runny. If they're formulafed (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Amount-and-Schedule-of-Formula-Feedings.aspx), their stools usually will be tan or yellow in color. They will be firmer than a breastfed baby's, but should be no firmer than soft clay.

For example, if the digestive process slows down because of foods requiring more effort to digest (such as large amounts of cereal), the stools may become green; or if the baby is given supplemental iron (/English/ages-stages/baby/feedingnutrition/Pages/Vitamin-Iron-Supplements.aspx), the stools may turn dark brown. If there is a minor irritation of the anus, streaks of blood may appear on the outside of the stools. However, if there are large amounts of blood, mucus, or water in the stool (/English/health-issues/conditions/abdominal/Pages/Inflamamatory-BowelDisease.aspx), call your pediatrician immediately.

The telltale signs are a sudden increase in frequency (to more than one bowel movement per feeding) and unusually high liquid content in the stool. Diarrhea may be a sign of intestinal infection (/English/safetyprevention/immunizations/Pages/Rotavirus-and-Other-Viruses-Causing-Gastrointestinal-Illness.aspx), or it may be caused by a change in the baby's diet. If the baby is breastfeeding, they can even develop diarrhea because of a change in the mother's diet (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Eating-for-Two-Your-Diet-AndBreastfeeding.aspx). \n\n The main concern with diarrhea is the possibility of dehydration. If fever is also present and your infant is less than three months old, call your pediatrician. If your baby is over three months and the fever lasts more than a day, check her urine output and rectal temperature (/English/health-issues/conditions/fever/Pages/Taking-aRectal-Temperature.aspx); then report your findings to your doctor for consideration. Make sure your baby continues to feed frequently. As much as anything else, if they simply looks sick, let your doctor know. \n\n The frequency of bowel movements varies widely among babies.

Around 3 months of age, \n\n## babies will begin exploring the world with their mouth and have \n\n## increased saliva and start to put their hands in their mouth.

It's a great time to bond, distraction-free, as your tiny new family member enjoys the sensation of warm water on their skin. Yet this common parenting ritual often comes with questions, and sometimes anxiety, about when and how to do it well. \n\n**Here are some frequently asked questions from parents about topics related to baby bath timing, frequency, safety, and more.** \n\n## When should newborns get their first bath? \n\nThe timing of your baby's very first bath has changed over the last few years. While most institutions used to bathe babies within an hour or two of birth, many are changing their policies. \n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends (https://extranet.who.int/rhl/topics/newborn-health/carenewborn-infant/who-recommendation-bathing-and-other-immediate-postnatal-care-newborn) delaying baby's first bath until 24 hours after birth—or waiting at least 6 hours if a full day isn't possible for cultural reasons. \n\n## Why wait? \n\n Here are some reasons why it is now recommended to delay baby's first bath: \n\n Body temperature and blood sugar : Babies who get baths right away may be more likely to become cold and develophypothermia (/English/safety-prevention/at-play/Pages/Cold-Weather-Safety.aspx). The minor stress of an early bath can also make some babies more likely to have a drop in blood sugar (hypoglycemia (/English/health-issues/conditions/chronic/Pages/Causes-of-High-Blood-Glucose-and-Low-BloodGlucose.aspx)). \n\n Bonding and breastfeeding: Taking the baby away for a bath too soon can interrupt skin-to-skin care, motherchild bonding, and early breastfeeding success. Onestudy (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23635002)showed a 166% increase in hospital breastfeeding success after implementing a 12-hour delay in baby's first bath compared to those bathed within the first couple hours.","metadata":{"id":154}}],["155",{"pageContent":"Dry skin : Vernix, a waxy white substance that coats a baby's skin before birth, acts as a natural moisturizer and may have anti-bacterial properties. Learn more about vernix here. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4668496/) According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), it's best to leave vernix on a newborns' skin for a while to help prevent their delicate skin from drying out. This is especially important for preemies, as their skin is highly prone to injury. \n\n#### Note: Babies of mothers with HIV or the Hepatitis viruses will still be bathed after the initial breastfeed in order to \n\n#### decrease risk to hospital staff and family members. \n\n## How often do babies need a bath once they are home? \n\nNewborns don't need a bath every day. They rarely sweat or get dirty enough to need a full bath that often. \n\n\n**Three baths per week during baby's first year may be enough. Bathing more frequently can dry out your baby's skin.** \n\n## Can my baby have a bath before the umbilical cord falls off? \n\nOnly give your newborn sponge baths until the stump of the umbilical cord falls off, which usually happens by about one or two weeks of age. If it remains beyond that time, there may be other issues at play. See the baby's doctor if the cord has not dried up and fallen off by the time the baby is two months old. Learn more here (/English/agesstages/baby/bathing-skin-care/Pages/Umbilical-Cord-Care.aspx). \n\n## How to give a sponge bath \n\nA sponge bath is like a regular bath, except you don't put your baby in the water. \n\n### Baby sponge bath safety tips: \n\n Get supplies ready before you begin. Have a basin of water, a damp washcloth rinsed in soap-free water, a dry towel, and anything else you might need within reach before you begin.","metadata":{"id":155}}],["156",{"pageContent":"Get supplies ready before you begin. Have a basin of water, a damp washcloth rinsed in soap-free water, a dry towel, and anything else you might need within reach before you begin. \n\n Lay baby on a flat surface that is comfortable for both of you —a changing table, bed, floor, or counter next to the sink will do. Pad hard surfaces with a blanket or fluffy towel. If your baby is on a surface above the floor, always use a safety strap or keep one hand on her to prevent falls. \n\n Start washing the face first. Use the dampened cloth to wash her face, being careful not to get water into her eyes or mouth. Then, dip it in the basin of water before washing the rest of her body and, finally, the diaper area. \n\n Keep baby warm. During the sponge bath, wrap your baby in a dry towel and uncover only the parts of her body you are actively washing. Pay special attention to creases under the arms, behind the ears, around the neck, and, especially with a girl, in the genital area. \n\n## When is my baby ready for a regular bath? \n\nOnce the umbilical area is healed, you can try placing your baby directly in the water. His first baths should be as gentle and brief as possible. He may protest a little. (If this happens go back to sponge baths for a week or two, then try the bath again). Babies usually make it clear when they're ready. \n\n Back to Top \n\n\n### Baby bathtub safety tips:","metadata":{"id":156}}],["157",{"pageContent":"Back to Top \n\n\n### Baby bathtub safety tips: \n\n Use an infant tub or sink. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission recommends a hard plastic baby bathtub that has a sloped, textured surface or sling that keeps your baby from sliding. Only use an infant bath tub manufactured on or after October 2, 2017 so it meets current safety standards (https://www.cpsc.gov/content/new-federal-safety-standard-for-infant-bath-tubs-takes-effect). Some parents find it easiest to bathe a newborn in a bathinette, sink, or plastic tub lined with a clean towel. Yes, a sink! Sometimes easiest is best; just be careful. Sinks are slippery and have all sorts of things sticking out like faucets and handles. \n\n Avoid using bath seats. These seats provide support so a child can sit upright in an adult bathtub. Unfortunately, they can easily tip over. A child can fall into the bathwater and drown. \n\n Use touch supervision. Have a towel and other bath supplies (/English/ages-stages/baby/bathing-skincare/Pages/Preparing-Your-Bathing-Area.aspx) within reach so you can keep a hand on your baby at all times. If you've forgotten something or need to answer the phone or door during the bath, you must take the baby with you. \n\n Start practicing infant water safety (/English/safety-prevention/at-play/Pages/Infant-WaterSafety.aspx) now : Never leave a baby alone in the bath, even for an instant. Most child drownings inside the home occur in bathtubs, and more than half of bathtub deaths involve children under 1 year of age.","metadata":{"id":157}}],["158",{"pageContent":"Check the water temperature. Fill the basin with 2 inches of water that feels warm—not hot—to the inside of your wrist or elbow. If you're filling the basin from the tap, turn the cold water on first (and off last) to avoid scalding yourself or your child. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that the hottest temperature at the faucet should be no more than 120 degrees Fahrenheit to help avoid burns. In many cases you can adjust your water heater setting (https://www.cpsc.gov/s3fs-public/5098.pdf) to not go above this temperature. Tap water that's too hot can quickly cause burns serious enough to require a hospital visit or even surgery. In fact, hot water scalds (/English/health-issues/injuries-emergencies/Pages/Treating-andPreventing-Burns.aspx) are the top cause of burns among babies and young children. \n\n Keep baby warm. Once you've undressed your baby, place her in the water immediately so she doesn't get chilled. Use one of your hands to support her head and the other to guide her in, feet first. Talk to her encouragingly, and gently lower the rest of her body until she's in the tub. Most of her body and face should be well above the water level for safety, so you'll need to pour warm water over her body frequently to keep her warm. \n\n Use soap sparingly. Soaps can dry out your baby's skin. If a cleanser is needed for heavily soiled areas, use only mild, neutral-pH soaps without additives. Rinse soap from the skin right away. Wash baby's hair two or three times a week using a mild shampoo or body wash. \n\n You may see some scaly patches on your baby's scalp called cradle cap (/English/agesstages/baby/bathing-skin-care/Pages/Cradle-Cap.aspx)―a harmless condition that appears in many babies. You can loosen the scales with a soft-bristled brush while shampooing in the bathtub, but it's also okay to leave it alone if it doesn't bother you. It's unlikely to bother your baby, and she will outgrow it.","metadata":{"id":158}}],["159",{"pageContent":"Clean gently. Use a soft cloth to wash your baby's face and hair, being careful not to scrub or tug the skin. Massage her entire scalp gently, including the area over her fontanelles (soft spots). When you rinse shampoo from her head, cup your hand across her forehead so the suds run toward the sides, not into her eyes. If some suds do get into her eyes, use the wet washcloth to wipe them with plain, lukewarm water. Wash the rest of her body from the top down. \n\n Have fun in the tub. If your baby enjoys her bath, give her some extra time to splash and play in the water. The more fun your child has in the bath, the less she'll be afraid of the water. Bathing should be a very relaxing and soothing experience, so don't rush unless she's unhappy. \n\n Young infants don't really need bath toys , since just being in the water is usually exciting enough. Once a baby is old enough for the bathtub, however, toys become key. Containers, floating toys, even waterproof books make wonderful distractions as you cleanse your baby. \n\n Get out and dry off. When bath time is finished, promptly wrap a towel around your baby's head and body to help her stay warm while she is still wet. Bathing a baby of any age is wet work, so you may want to wear a terrycloth apron or hang a towel over your shoulder to keep yourself dry. Gently pat baby dry and apply a small amount of fragrance-free, hypoallergenic moisturizing lotion right after a bath to help prevent dry skin or eczema (/English/health-issues/conditions/skin/Pages/Eczema.aspx). \n\n Back to Top \n\n\n## Remember... \n\nKnowing the basics can make bathing your infant a breeze.

Communication between the brain and bladder. If the bladder signals the brain that it's filling up with urine— \n\n## and the brain doesn't send a message back to the bladder to relax and hold the urine until morning—bedwetting \n\n## will happen. Likewise, if the bladder signals the brain that it's filling up with urine and the brain doesn't hear the \n\n## signals, especially during deep sleep, bedwetting will happen. \n\n## 2. Stress or trauma. Sometimes when children experience stress (/English/health-issues/conditions/COVID\n\n## 19/Pages/Signs-your-Teen-May-Need-More-Support.aspx) or traumatic events, or when they get sick or \n\n## constipated (/English/health-issues/conditions/abdominal/Pages/constipation.aspx), children who have \n\n## previously been dry at night can have bouts of bedwetting. This is a different problem than the child who has \n\n## never been dry at night. Children with these short-term episodes of bedwetting usually have dry nights when the \n\n## underlying problem resolves. \n\n## 3. Medical concerns. Rarely, some children begin to wet the bed as a result of a serious medical problem. \n\n## What you can do","metadata":{"id":161}}],["162",{"pageContent":"## underlying problem resolves. \n\n## 3. Medical concerns. Rarely, some children begin to wet the bed as a result of a serious medical problem. \n\n## What you can do \n\n## Most children wet their beds during toilet training.

If this happens to your child, simply go back to training pants at night and \n\n## try again another time. The problem usually disappears as children get older. If children reach school age and still \n\n## have problems wetting the bed, it most likely means they have never developed nighttime bladder control. \n\n## If you are concerned about your child's bedwetting or your child expresses concern, talk with your child's doctor. You \n\n## may be asked the following questions about your child's bedwetting: \n\n## Is there a family history of bedwetting? \n\n## How often and when does your child urinate during the day? \n\n## Have there been any changes in your child's home life such as a new sibling, a move, or other family issue?

Depending on what kind of parent you are, this may make you feel better because you \n\n## know what your baby is getting, or it may give you something new to obsess about. Whenever you \n\n## read guidelines for bottle-feeding, remember that each baby is different. Bigger babies need \n\n## more food. Your baby may go through a growth spurt and seem hungry all the time, and then she \n\n## may have a period when she eats less for a while. In general babies know how much food they \n\n## need to grow. If you attend to your baby’s hunger cues, she’ll tell you how much food she wants \n\n## and when she’s full. \n\n## Choosing A Bottle \n\n## Choosing a bottle can be as challenging as picking a formula. Manufacturers make all sorts of claims about their \n\n## nipples working more like the human breast or their bottles preventing gas. I haven’t seen good scientific literature \n\n## that supports these claims, so I can’t recommend one brand over another. \n\n## How Many Ounces? \n\n## Just like breastfed babies, bottle-fed newborns may start off slowly for 2 to 3 days, often taking only 1 to 2 ounces (30– \n\n## 60 mL) at a time. After the first 2 to 3 days of life she’ll probably be taking 2 to 3 ounces (60–90 mL) every 3 to 4 hours. \n\n## Sometimes your baby may sleep 4 to 5 hours between bottles, but she’ll need a lot of food over the first month or so of \n\n## life, so if she hasn’t awakened to eat after 5 hours it’s a good idea to go ahead and wake her up.

You might even \n\n## consider waking her up after 3 or 4 hours during the daytime, hoping she’ll sleep a little longer at night. \n\n## After the first month of life (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/The-First-Month-Feeding-and\n\n## Nutrition.aspx) your infant is likely to take around 4 ounces from the bottle every 4 hours or so, at least on average. \n\n## That intake rises gradually so that by age 6 months, she’ll take 6 to 8 ounces (180–240 mL) 4 or 5 times a day. Another \n\n## way to think about normal intake is by weight; for every pound of body weight, your infant will consume around 2½ \n\n## ounces (75 mL) per day. That said, every baby is different, and her doctor will weigh and measure her at each wellness \n\n## examination (/English/family-life/health-management/Pages/Well-Child-Care-A-Check-Up-for-Success.aspx) to \n\n## assess whether her growth is appropriate for her age. \n\n## Hunger Cues \n\n## Whether you’re breastfeeding or bottle-feeding, your baby will give the same cues to let you know when she’s hungry \n\n## and when she’s full. She will start rooting, scooting, sucking on her hand, and smacking her lips when she needs food. \n\n## She will release the nipple, turn away, and often fall asleep when she’s full. As she grows she may fall asleep less often \n\n## and instead look up and grin at you. You can be pretty confident at this point that the feeding is over, especially if she’s \n\n## letting formula drip on your pants. \n\n## Feeding FAQs \n\n## The 3 most common questions I answer about feeding, no matter the source, are: \n\n## “Is she getting enough?” \n\n## “Is she getting too much?” \n\n## “When will she stop waking up at night to feed?” \n\n## The first question we’ve already answered.

You’ll want to support her \n\n### in a semi-upright position, with her head cradled in the crook of your arm. Hold the bottle so that milk completely covers the \n\n### nipple; that way your baby isn’t swallowing air. Try not to bottle-feed your baby while she’s on her back. Lying down increases the \n\n### risk that she’ll choke, and it allows milk to run into her eustachian tubes, possibly causing middle ear infections \n\n### (/English/news/Pages/Middle-Ear-Infections.aspx). In the first few weeks of life you may have to gently touch the nipple to \n\n### her cheek to stimulate the rooting reflex. \n\n## When to Call the Doctor \n\n### Overfeeding often results in spitting up (/English/tips-tools/Symptom-Checker/Pages/Spitting-Up-Reflux.aspx) and \n\n### contributes to obesity (/english/health-issues/conditions/obesity/Pages/default.aspx).

If the C-section is done without prior planning, you may have endured a long and \n\n## difficult delivery. If that’s the case, your doctor may be more worried about your rest and \n\n## recovery and less likely to encourage you to breastfeed right after delivery.

Women who have planned C-sections, on the other hand, often know what to expect \n\n## and are fully prepared to breastfeed their newborn. \n\n## The good news is that the method of delivery has little effect on your ability to nurse your baby. \n\n## Your breast milk will come in almost as readily as it would have if you had delivered vaginally.

When you are counseled about a cesarean delivery, it is a good idea to remind the \n\n## obstetrician and anesthesiologist that you intend to breastfeed. \n\n## Following a cesarean delivery, your doctor will give you pain medications, initially through your IV and later in pill \n\n## form, to help make you comfortable.

In \n\n## other cases, teeth don't appear until the child is almost a \n\n## year old. \n\n## Many nursing parents decide that it's time to stop \n\n## breastfeeding when they first notice a tooth. Usually, \n\n## this is because the baby has nipped the breast at the \n\n## end of a feeding session. Or, the nursing parent fears \n\n## they will be bitten soon. Yet many babies with teeth (or \n\n## those who are teething) never bite when breastfeeding. \n\n## How to prevent a breastfeeding baby from biting \n\n## If your baby has sprouted a tooth and you are concerned that they may nip you as a feeding ends: Keep your \n\n## finger ready to break the suction and remove your breast as soon as her rhythmic suckling stops (and before she \n\n## starts to drift off or feel playful). \n\n## If your baby has already bitten you while nursing: Say no firmly and then remove your baby from your breast. \n\n## Try to keep this action as bland and matter-of-fact as possible. Too much anger or even amusement may interest \n\n## them enough to make them want to repeat the experiment again. Once they realize that biting means no more \n\n## breast, they will learn to stifle the impulse. (Meanwhile, don't forget to offer your baby a one-piece teething ring \n\n## when they are not nursing.) \n\n## How to prevent baby-bottle tooth decay \n\n## Once your baby's teeth have begun to come in, keep in mind that even breastfeeding babies are sometimes \n\n## susceptible to baby-bottle tooth decay (BBTD) (/English/ages-stages/baby/teething-tooth-care/Pages/How-to-Prevent","metadata":{"id":192}}],["193",{"pageContent":"## susceptible to baby-bottle tooth decay (BBTD) (/English/ages-stages/baby/teething-tooth-care/Pages/How-to-Prevent\n\n## Tooth-Decay-in-Your-Baby.aspx). BBTD is a major cause of dental cavities in infants that can also cause serious damage \n\n## to permanent teeth later on. \n\n## Baby-bottle tooth decay results from teeth being coated in almost any liquid other than water for long periods. It \n\n## occurs most commonly among babies who are put to bed with a bottle of formula or juice. Breastfeeding infants who \n\n## fall asleep while nursing with unswallowed milk remaining in their mouths are also vulnerable to tooth decay. \n\n## Beyond the first year, dental caries—tooth decay—can occur in toddlers who receive sugary liquids in a bottle or who \n\n## are nursing and eating foods with sugar and carbohydrates. Make a point of removing your breast from your \n\n## baby's mouth once they have fallen asleep. \n\n## Did you know? \n\n## An actively nursing baby will not bite because their tongue covers their lower teeth. A baby who nips the breast \n\n## as they start to pull away near the end of a feeding can be taught to stop. Try not to let this minor challenge get in \n\n## the way of breastfeeding so early in your nursing relationship. \n\n\n#### 3/9/23, 12:26 PM Breastfeeding After Your Baby Gets Teeth HealthyChildren.org \n\n#### https://healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/When-Your-Baby-Gets-Teeth.aspx 2/2 \n\n## Tips to promote dental health right from the start \n\n### Your pediatrician will check your baby's teeth as part of the well-child visits (/English/family-life/health\n\n### management/Pages/Well-Child-Care-A-Check-Up-for-Success.aspx) during the first year of life and beyond. \n\n### To stimulate healthy gums: It is a good idea to wipe the gums at least once a day, beginning at birth, even before \n\n### any teeth have erupted in your child's mouth. \n\n### After teeth erupt: Wiping their gums and teeth with a piece of gauze or a damp cloth after feedings and before","metadata":{"id":193}}],["194",{"pageContent":"### any teeth have erupted in your child's mouth. \n\n### After teeth erupt: Wiping their gums and teeth with a piece of gauze or a damp cloth after feedings and before \n\n### bedtime will help maintain good oral hygiene. \n\n### Once your child has several teeth: Start using water and a soft-bristled, child-size toothbrush for daily cleaning \n\n### with a small smear of fluoridated toothpaste.

Breast milk can literally give babies a head start in preventing and fighting \n\n## infections. \n\n## Breast milk also is made up of other proteins, fats, sugars and even white blood cells that work to fight infection in \n\n## many different ways. They are especially helpful in fighting gastrointestinal infections, since breast milk heads right \n\n## to the stomach and intestine when your baby eats. The different factors in breast milk work directly within the \n\n## intestine before being absorbed and reaching the entire body.

Two major \n\n## influences are at work: nature (genetic factors, heredity) and nurture (experience). These \n\n## interact with each other in ways that are particular to each child. To better understand the \n\n## similarities and differences among siblings, let's look at both of these factors more closely. \n\n## Nature \n\n## Because of heredity—the biological or genetic influences of the same two parents on each child— \n\n## parents might expect their children to be alike. But overall, children have only about a fifty-fifty \n\n## chance of developing any particular inherited trait (physical appearance, personality, intelligence, aptitudes, health), \n\n## and even when these traits are present, they can vary. \n\n## For instance, researchers have found that siblings tend to be more similar in their physical characteristics than in \n\n## their likelihood of developing the same diseases. Also, while siblings may resemble one another in their intellectual \n\n## aptitude and other psychological characteristics early in life, these similarities generally diminish by adulthood, while \n\n## differences become more pronounced. Even in childhood, siblings with similar levels of intelligence may differ in \n\n## their school achievement, since academic success can be strongly affected by the different life experiences of each \n\n## child. \n\n## Nurture \n\n## Nurture (or experience) refers to the nonhereditary influences on your child's development.

Similarly, some grocery and drugstore chains now tally up \n\n## dollars spent on baby items and offer rebates or coupons each time you reach a certain total (for example, a $10 \n\n## store coupon every time you spend $100 on baby items at that store). \n\n## DIAPER(LESS) TRIVIA \n\n## Did you know that in certain Asian and African cultures, babies are not put into diapers? When a baby awakens or \n\n## the parent notices certain cues, the parent places the baby over a bush or another designated area to pee or poop. \n\n## Although you may want to adapt this technique when it comes time to potty train, based on social norms in \n\n## America, we don't recommend you try this with your newborn at home! \n\n\n##### 3/9/23, 12:17 PM Buying Diapers HealthyChildren.org \n\n##### https://healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/diapers-clothing/Pages/Buying-Diapers.aspx 2/2","metadata":{"id":227}}],["228",{"pageContent":"##### 3/9/23, 12:17 PM Buying Diapers HealthyChildren.org \n\n##### https://healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/diapers-clothing/Pages/Buying-Diapers.aspx 2/2 \n\n#### Consider your options.

When will his foreskin \n\n## retract? \n\n## In the first several years your son's foreskin will separate from the tip of the penis. Some \n\n## foreskins separate soon after birth or even before birth, but this is rare. When it happens is \n\n## different for every child. It may take a few weeks, months, or years. Once this happens, the \n\n## foreskin can be pulled back away from the tip of the penis. This is called foreskin retraction. \n\n## Most boys will be able to retract their foreskins by the time they are 5 years old, yet others will not be able to until the \n\n## teen years. As a boy becomes more aware of his body, he will most likely discover how to retract his own foreskin. But \n\n## foreskin retraction should never be forced. Until the foreskin fully separates, do not try to pull it back. Forcing the \n\n## foreskin to retract before it is ready can cause severe pain, bleeding, and tears in the skin. \n\n## Smegma \n\n## When the foreskin separates from the head of the penis, skin cells are shed. These skin cells may look like white, \n\n## pearl-like lumps under the foreskin. These are called smegma. Smegma is normal and nothing to worry about. \n\n## Cleaning \n\n## If your son's foreskin separates before he reaches puberty, an occasional retraction with cleansing beneath will do. \n\n## Once your son starts puberty, he should clean beneath his foreskin as part of his daily routine, just like washing his \n\n## hair and brushing his teeth. \n\n## Teach your son to clean his foreskin in the following way: \n\n## Step 1 : Gently pull the foreskin back away from the end of the penis. \n\n## Step 2 : Rinse underneath the foreskin with soap and warm water. \n\n## Step 3 : Pull the foreskin back over the penis \n\n## Last Updated 6/19/2017","metadata":{"id":230}}],["231",{"pageContent":"## Step 2 : Rinse underneath the foreskin with soap and warm water. \n\n## Step 3 : Pull the foreskin back over the penis \n\n## Last Updated 6/19/2017 \n\n## Source Care of the Uncircumcised Penis (Copyright © 2007 American Academy of Pediatrics, Updated 6/2007) \n\n## The information contained on this Web site should not be used as a substitute for the medical care and advice of your pediatrician.

Hill, MD, FAAP \n\nIn the weeks after my first child, Abby, was born I spent a lot of time doing \"kangaroo care (/English/agesstages/baby/preemie/Pages/About-Skin-to-Skin-Care.aspx)\" with her—keeping her warm on my bare chest while her mom caught some rest between feeds. As she grew hungry, Abby would inchworm towards my chin, pecking and nuzzling in a vain search for a food source that was in fact on the other side of the room. When she grew frustrated she would raise her head and look up at \n\n### my face with an expression that seemed to say, \" Dad, what are you \n\n### for? \" There were times I wasn't sure I knew the answer. \n\n## Dad's Many Roles \n\nNow that Abby is 16, she can ask me such questions aloud (and does). In the intervening years I have been a stay-athome dad (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/types-of-families/Pages/Stay-At-Home-Dads.aspx), a working dad (/English/family-life/work-play/Pages/Working-Parents.aspx), a married dad, a single dad (/English/familylife/family-dynamics/types-of-families/Pages/Stresses-of-Single-Parenting.aspx), and a stepdad (/English/familylife/family-dynamics/types-of-families/Pages/Some-Advice-for-Stepparents.aspx). In each of these roles, I've tried to figure out what I was for and hoped that my involvement made a difference in my kids' lives. \n\nIn the meantime, **the volume of science on fatherhood has exploded** , and it tells us that dads are for a lot, in both \n\n### traditional and nontraditional roles. See the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) updated clinical report, Fathers' \n\n### Role in the Care and Development of Their Children: The Role of Pediatricians \n\n### (http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2016-1128) , for more information. \n\n## Involved Dads = Positive Effects on Kids","metadata":{"id":271}}],["272",{"pageContent":"### (http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2016-1128) , for more information. \n\n## Involved Dads = Positive Effects on Kids \n\n**The positive effects of paternal involvement start before birth.** Mothers with involved fathers are more likely to receive early prenatal (/English/ages-stages/prenatal/Pages/default.aspx) care and are less likely to deliver prematurely (/English/ages-stages/baby/preemie/Pages/default.aspx), and their newborns are less likely to suffer infant mortality. Right after birth, fathers can help support breastfeeding (/English/agesstages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Dads-Role-in-Breastfeeding.aspx), and their participation in kangaroo care helps newborns calm themselves and sleep soundly. \n\n**In childhood, dads' involvement contributes to language development, and children whose fathers are involved early on enjoy protection from mental health and behavioral problems**. The good news continues through the teen years, when paternal involvement is associated with decreased high-risk behaviors, lower rates of teen pregnancy (/English/ages-stages/teen/dating-sex/Pages/Teenage-Pregnancy.aspx), protection from depression (/English/health-issues/conditions/emotional-problems/Pages/childhood-depression-what-parents-can-do-tohelp.aspx), and improved cognitive development (/English/ages-stages/preschool/Pages/Cognitive-Development-InPreschool-Children.aspx). As a whole, the picture of childhood looks better when dad is in it. \n\n## Changing Times \n\nGiven all these positive effects, the even better news is that paternal involvement in child-rearing has increased dramatically since the days when I was the only dad sitting on the alphabet rug at the library's toddler reading time. \n\n Between 2003 and 2012, the number of stay-at-home-dads skyrocketed from 98,000 to an 189,000. \n\n Dads in 2011 had more than doubled the amount of time they spent on housework and childcare from 1965.","metadata":{"id":272}}],["273",{"pageContent":"Between 2003 and 2012, the number of stay-at-home-dads skyrocketed from 98,000 to an 189,000. \n\n Dads in 2011 had more than doubled the amount of time they spent on housework and childcare from 1965. \n\n\nLet's face it: in the era of \"Father Knows Best\" a lot of fathers were just guessing. \n\n## Both Parents Bring Different Strengths \n\n**When we ask who's better, fathers or mothers, the answer is \"yes.\"** Both parents bring different strengths to the family. Fathers, for example, tend to play in more stimulating, vigorous, and arousing ways with their children. It's not that they don't also read, snuggle, and kiss boo-boos, but dads tend to be more rambunctious and exploratory during fun time (/English/ages-stages/preschool/nutrition-fitness/Pages/Motor-Activity-and-Self-Play.aspx). Fathers are important not because they are just like mothers, but because they are in some ways different. \n\n## Challenges of Maintaining Dad's Involvement \n\n**With 40% of today's births being to unmarried couples, many families face the challenge of maintaining dads' involvement.** The trend away from traditional marriage correlates to an increase in the number of nonresident fathers. But while 1 in 6 fathers do not live with their children, only a tiny fraction, 1% to 2%, never see their kids. In most cases finding some way for kids and fathers to interact helps both parties, leading to measurable improvements in children's academic achievement (/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/school/Pages/Ten-Tips-for-Your-ChildsSuccess-in-School.aspx), emotional well-being, and behavioral adjustment (/English/family-life/familydynamics/communication-discipline/Pages/How-to-Shape-Manage-Young-Child-Behavior.aspx). \n\n## Healthy Dads, Healthy Kids","metadata":{"id":273}}],["274",{"pageContent":"## Healthy Dads, Healthy Kids \n\n**It should not surprise us that a father's health affects his family's health**. Paternal depression has significant negative impacts on moms' and children's mental health. Doctors are now recognizing that post-partum depression affects dads, too (/English/ages-stages/prenatal/delivery-beyond/Pages/dads-can-get-postpartum-depressiontoo.aspx), and they are beginning to screen for it. On the positive side, dads who maintain a healthy weight can lead their children to healthy weights, as well, since fathers' weights correlate with childhood obesity and overweight. And vaccinating dads against pertussis (Tdap (/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Tetanus-DiphtheriaPertussis-Tdap-Vaccine-What-You-Need-to-Know.aspx)) can prevent an estimated 16% of cases of whooping cough (/English/health-issues/conditions/chest-lungs/Pages/Whooping-Cough.aspx). \n\n## Paternal Leave: Dads Need Time, Too! \n\n**Corporations and governments are starting to recognize the critical role fathers play** in their families' mental and physical health, and increasingly they are seeing how these benefits contribute to the success of a company or even a nation.

Here's what children need — no matter what the age.** \n\n## Babies \n\nDuring this stage of life, it's almost all about the milk — whether it's breast milk (/English/agesstages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Breastfeeding-Benefits-Your-Babys-Immune-System.aspx), formula (/English/agesstages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Choosing-a-Formula.aspx), or a combination of the two. Breast milk or formula will provide practically every nutrient a baby needs for the first year of life. \n\n At about six months most babies are ready to start solid foods (/English/ages-stages/baby/feedingnutrition/Pages/Starting-Solid-Foods.aspx) like iron-fortified infant cereal and strained fruits, vegetables, and pureed meats. Because breast milk may not provide enough iron and zinc when babies are around six to nine months, fortified cereals and meats can help breastfed babies in particular. \n\n Once you do start adding foods, don't go low-fat crazy (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/LowFat-Diets-For-Babies.aspx). Although the AAP guidelines state fat restriction in some babies is appropriate, in general, you don't want to restrict fats under age two because a healthy amount of fat is important for babies' brain and nerve development. \n\n## Toddlers & Preschoolers \n\nToddlers and preschoolers grow in spurts and their appetites come and go in spurts, so they may eat a whole lot one day and then hardly anything the next. It's normal, and as long as you offer them a healthy selection, they will get what they need.","metadata":{"id":276}}],["277",{"pageContent":"Calcium, the body's building block, is needed to develop strong, healthy bones and teeth. Children may not believe or care that milk \"does a body good,\" but it is the best source of much-needed calcium. Still, there's hope for the milk-allergic (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Milk-Allergy.aspx), lactose-intolerant, or those who just don't like milk. Lactose-free milk, soy milk, tofu, sardines, and calcium-fortified orange juices, cereals, waffles, and oatmeal are some calcium-filled options. In some cases, pediatricians may recommend calcium supplements. \n\n Fiber (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Kids-Need-Fiber-Heres-Why-and-How.aspx) is another important focus. Toddlers start to say \"no\" more and preschoolers can be especially opinionated about what they eat. The kids may want to stick to the bland, beige, starchy diet (think chicken nuggets, fries, macaroni), but this is really the time to encourage fruits, vegetables (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/How-to-Get-Your-Childto-Eat-More-Fruits-and-Veggies.aspx), whole grains, and beans, which all provide fiber. Not only does fiber prevent heart disease (/English/health-issues/conditions/heart/Pages/Heart-Disease.aspx) and other conditions, but it also helps aid digestion and prevents constipation (/English/healthissues/conditions/abdominal/Pages/constipation.aspx), something you and your child will be thankful for. \n\n\n## Gradeschoolers","metadata":{"id":277}}],["278",{"pageContent":"## Gradeschoolers \n\nIt isn't uncommon for a 6or 7-year-old to suddenly decide to be a vegetarian (/English/agesstages/gradeschool/nutrition/Pages/Vegetartian-Diet-for-Children.aspx) once they understand animals and where food comes from. This doesn't mean your child won't get enough protein (/English/agesstages/teen/nutrition/Pages/Protein-for-the-Teen-Athlete.aspx); animal tissue isn't the only place we get protein. Rice, beans, eggs, milk, and peanut butter all have protein. So whether your child goes \"no-meat\" for a week or for life, he or she will likely still get sufficient amounts of protein. \n\nAreas that might be a little too sufficient are sugars, fats, and sodium. \n\n This is a time when kids first go to school and have a little bit more choices in what they eat, especially if they're getting it in the cafeteria themselves. Cakes, candy, chips, and other snacks might become lunchtime staples. \n\n The body needs carbs (sugars), fats, and sodium, but should be eaten in moderation, as too much can lead to unneeded weight gain and other health problems. \n\n Packing your child's lunch or going over the lunch menu and encouraging him or her to select healthier choices (/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/nutrition/Pages/Making-Healthy-Food-Choices.aspx) can help keep things on track. \n\n## Preteens & Teens \n\nAs puberty kicks in, young people need more calories to support the many changes they will experience. Unfortunately, for some, those extra calories come from fast food (/English/agesstages/teen/nutrition/Pages/Healthy-and-Unhealthy-Choices-at-Fast-Food-Restaurants.aspx) or \"junk\" foods with little nutritional value.","metadata":{"id":278}}],["279",{"pageContent":"Some adolescents go the opposite way and restrict calories, fats, or carbs. Adolescence is the time kids start to become conscious of their weight and body image, which, for some, can lead to eating disorders (/English/healthissues/conditions/emotional-problems/Pages/Is-Your-Teen-at-Risk-for-Developing-an-Eating-Disorder.aspx) or other unhealthy behaviors. Parents should be aware of changes in their child's eating patterns and make family dinners a priority (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/Pages/Mealtime-as-Family-Time.aspx) at least once or twice a week. \n\n Like calories, calcium requirements are higher. Calcium is more important than ever during the tween and teen years because the majority of bone mass is built (/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/puberty/Pages/PhysicalDevelopment-of-School-Age-Children.aspx) during this time. Encouraging kids to have milk, milk products, or calcium-rich alternatives, should help them get more calcium. \n\n Your child's gender may play a role in whether he or she needs more of a particular nutrient. For instance, teen girls need more iron than their male counterparts to replace what's lost during menstruation (/English/agesstages/gradeschool/puberty/Pages/Physical-Development-Girls-What-to-Expect.aspx), and males need slightly more protein than girls. \n\nAlthough getting your child to eat healthy — regardless of his or her age — can be a constant battle, its one well worth fighting. A healthy child becomes a healthy adult, and only with your support and guidance will your child be both. \n\n## Water: Drink Up! \n\nWater makes up more than half of kids' body weight and is needed to keep all parts of the body functioning properly. \n\n There's no specific amount of water recommended for children, but it's a good idea to give them water throughout the day — not just when they're thirsty. \n\n Babies generally don't need water during the first year of life. \n\n If your child doesn't like the taste of water, add a bit of lemon or lime for flavor.","metadata":{"id":279}}],["280",{"pageContent":"Babies generally don't need water during the first year of life. \n\n If your child doesn't like the taste of water, add a bit of lemon or lime for flavor. \n\n Fruits and veggies are also good sources of water. \n\n Kids should drink more water when ill, when it's hot out (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/ProtectingChildren-from-Extreme-Heat-Information-for-Parents.aspx), or when engaged in physical activity. \n\n Back to Top \n\n\n## Recommended Amount of Calories \n\nHere's what the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommends kids get calorie-wise and from each food group for a healthy, balanced diet: \n\n## Additional Information from HealthyChildren.org: \n\n Kids Need Fiber: Here's Why and How (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Kids-Need-Fiber-Heres-Whyand-How.aspx) How to Get Your Child to Eat More Fruits and Veggies (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/How-to-GetYour-Child-to-Eat-More-Fruits-and-Veggies.aspx) Making Healthy Food Choices (/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/nutrition/Pages/Making-Healthy-FoodChoices.aspx) Healthy and Unhealthy Choices at Fast Food Restaurants (/English/ages-stages/teen/nutrition/Pages/Healthyand-Unhealthy-Choices-at-Fast-Food-Restaurants.aspx) \n\n**Last Updated** 8/20/2020 **Source** Committee on Nutrition (Copyright © 2016 American Academy of Pediatrics) The information contained on this Web site should not be used as a substitute for the medical care and advice of your pediatrician.

Although cow's milk is the basis for \n\n## such formulas, the milk has been changed dramatically \n\n## to make it safe for infants. It is treated by heating and \n\n## other methods to make the protein more digestible. More milk sugar (lactose) is added to make the concentration \n\n## equal to that found in breast milk, and the butterfat is removed and replaced with vegetable oils and other fats that \n\n## infants can more easily digest and are better for infant growth. \n\n## Iron-fortified baby formula \n\n## Cow's milk-based baby formulas have additional iron added. These iron-fortified formulas have dramatically reduced \n\n## the rate of iron-deficiency anemia (/English/health-issues/conditions/chronic/Pages/Anemia-and-Your-Child.aspx) \n\n## in infancy in recent decades. \n\n## Some infants do not have enough natural reserves of iron, a mineral necessary for normal human growth and \n\n## development. For that reason, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) currently recommends that iron\n\n## fortified formula be used for all infants who are not breastfed, or who are only partially breastfed, from birth to \n\n## one year of age. \n\n## Additional iron is available in many foods (including baby food), especially in meats, egg yolks, and iron-fortified \n\n## cereals.

Unless you relish \n\n## the thought of hand-washing a lot of baby clothes and frequently replacing those that don’t hold \n\n## up well, we suggest you give some serious thought to the durability and washability of the baby \n\n## clothes you buy—especially your baby’s everyday outfits, Onesies, and sleepers. \n\n## Washing. Because newborns tend to have sensitive skin (and because you don’t know who \n\n## has handled the clothing and with what before it made its way into your possession), it’s \n\n## generally a good idea to wash all clothes prior to using them. An exception might be \n\n## outerwear such as coats and jackets that don’t have much contact with the skin (and tend not to wash and dry \n\n## easily).

It is a common recommendation that baby clothes should be washed separately, using special \n\n## “baby” detergents that supposedly leave fewer residues and are therefore less likely to cause skin irritation. In \n\n## reality, we’ve found that many if not most parents simply toss their baby’s clothes in with the rest of the family’s \n\n## laundry without causing any problems. That said, it is worth paying attention to the fact that detergents in \n\n## general don’t strip away the flame-retardant properties of sleepwear, but soap flakes can.

This lump may be \n\n## the result of a clogged milk duct, which can happen if there’s an abrupt change in the feeding \n\n## schedule, inadequate draining of the breast, not varying nursing positions, or wearing clothes or \n\n## bras that are too tight. \n\n## Treatment \n\n## A clogged duct should be dealt with immediately since it can lead to a breast infection. The best \n\n## initial treatment for a clogged duct is to continue nursing, taking care to drain the breast as much as possible with \n\n## each feeding. (If you suddenly stop breastfeeding, your breast will probably become engorged, which could make the \n\n## condition worse and lead to an infection.) \n\n## Before each feeding, gently massage the breast, beginning on the outside and working your way toward the nipple, \n\n## paying particular attention to the firm area.

Next, \n\n## you had to get a feel for when it was time to shift gears, and learn how to do so smoothly while \n\n## easing the clutch pedal down and up again. \n\n## During the toilet-training process, your child must learn to coordinate an equally complex \n\n## combination of physical and cognitive tasks. She must familiarize herself with the necessary \n\n## “equipment” (her body and its functions), associate physical sensations with the proper \n\n## responses, picture what she wants to do (use the potty), create a plan to get there, begin using it, \n\n## and remain in place long enough to finish, which requires both memory and concentration. Throughout this learning \n\n## process, she must be able to understand your explanations, commands, and responses to some extent, and express her \n\n## own feelings about toilet use. \n\n## Body Awareness \n\n## Clearly, all of this learning takes time. The first steps in this process involve bodily sensation—the ability to associate \n\n## an inner feeling of fullness with the bowel movement or urination that results—and usually take place at around \n\n## twelve to eighteen months. Your efforts to reinforce this awareness by remarking on the poop or pee to come are \n\n## among the first productive actions you can take to start your child thinking about potty use. \n\n## As time passes, your child may demonstrate discomfort over a dirty diaper, try to remove her diaper or resist being","metadata":{"id":311}}],["312",{"pageContent":"## As time passes, your child may demonstrate discomfort over a dirty diaper, try to remove her diaper or resist being \n\n## diapered, and otherwise show that her awareness of her physical state is expanding.

You're not alone! \n\n## Because there are many different types of diaper rashes―and they can look surprisingly similar―check out this list \n\n## from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) to help identify, soothe, and prevent several different types of \n\n## diaper rashes. \n\n## 1. Irritant diaper rash \n\n## The most common type of diaper rash is \"irritant dermatitis.\" The diaper \n\n## area spends much of the day in contact with two very irritating substances: \n\n## urine and stool. If your child has diarrhea (/English/ages-stages/baby/diapers\n\n## clothing/Pages/Diarrhea-in-Babies.aspx) or is teething (/English/ages\n\n## stages/baby/teething-tooth-care/Pages/Babys-First-Tooth-Facts-Parents\n\n## Should-Know.aspx)―meaning extra saliva is being swallowed and passes \n\n## through the gut―the chance of developing a diaper rash is even greater. \n\n## Irritant diaper rash looks like pink or red patches on the skin covered by the \n\n## diaper. The groin folds are more protected from urine and stool, so this skin usually looks normal. \n\n## Image caption: Examples of irritant diaper rash. The far right photo shows a more severe case with open sores. \n\n\n## What parents can do to prevent diaper rash: \n\n##### In general, try to limit contact of urine and stool with the skin: \n\n##### Change diapers frequently. Moisture from leaving a wet or soiled diaper on too long can cause skin to chafe. \n\n##### Urine in the diaper also can break down over time to produce irritating chemicals. In addition, the digestive \n\n##### enzymes that stool contains can start to wear away at skin. \n\n##### Clean the skin gently during changes. For wipes, choose a product that is free of alcohol and fragrance. You","metadata":{"id":330}}],["331",{"pageContent":"##### enzymes that stool contains can start to wear away at skin. \n\n##### Clean the skin gently during changes. For wipes, choose a product that is free of alcohol and fragrance. You \n\n##### can also cleanse the skin with water and a non-soap/gentle cleanser, which may be less painful than wiping if \n\n##### the skin is irritated or has open sores. Use a squirt or spray bottle of water for severe rashes, if possible, to rinse \n\n##### without rubbing. Pat gently and allow skin to air-dry. \n\n##### Coat the skin with a thick layer of barrier paste. The brand is less important than the ingredients. Zinc oxide \n\n##### and petrolatum are both good choices, and fragrance-free products are best. Think of diaper paste as a shield \n\n##### that sits between the skin and the contents of the diaper. If the paste isn't soiled, no need to rub it off during \n\n##### changes; simply add more paste on top. In general, there is no such thing as too much diaper paste. Apply a \n\n##### thick layer, like icing on a cupcake. \n\n##### Choose a highly absorbent diaper. The more absorbent the diaper, the better job it does of keeping the skin \n\n##### dry. Although there is no current evidence showing which type of diaper does the best job of preventing diaper \n\n##### rash, cloth diapers (/English/ages-stages/baby/diapers-clothing/Pages/Diapers-Disposable-or-Cloth.aspx) \n\n##### typically are less absorbent than most disposable brands. If you use cloth diapers, you may want to consider \n\n##### using disposable diapers until the rash heals. \n\n##### Leave some breathing room. Make sure the diaper isn't too tight, especially overnight. A diaper that is loose \n\n##### will be less likely to rub against the skin. \n\n##### Keep the area clean. If the diaper area is irritated, a daily bath (/English/ages-stages/baby/bathing-skin\n\n##### care/Pages/Bathing-Your-Newborn.aspx) will help remove debris, irritants and possible bacteria. Don't forget to \n\n##### apply a thick layer of barrier paste in the diaper area after bathing.","metadata":{"id":331}}],["332",{"pageContent":"##### care/Pages/Bathing-Your-Newborn.aspx) will help remove debris, irritants and possible bacteria. Don't forget to \n\n##### apply a thick layer of barrier paste in the diaper area after bathing. \n\n## 2. Yeast infection \n\n##### Another fairly common cause of diaper rash is yeast infection, caused by overgrowth of a type of \n\n##### fungus found naturally in the digestive tract. Clues that the rash might be due to a yeast infection \n\n##### include shiny, bright red or pink patches with sharp edges. This rash may also have little pink \n\n##### bumps or pimples. In severe cases, there may be sores or cracking skin that oozes or bleeds. \n\n##### Unlike with irritant diaper rash, a yeast diaper rash is usually worse in the groin folds. \n\n##### A yeast diaper rash may develop after your baby has taken antibiotics. If your baby has this \n\n##### type of diaper rash, be sure to wash your hands thoroughly before and after diaper changes. Your \n\n#### pediatrician may recommend or prescribe a topical antifungal cream for the rash. See Thrush and \n\n#### Other Candida Infections (/English/health-issues/conditions/infections/Pages/Thrush-and-Other-Candida\n\n#### Infections.aspx). \n\n###### Image caption: Scaling skin spreading to the thighs and abdomen is typical with a yeast (candida) diaper rash. \n\n## 3. Bacteria \n\n##### Rarely, diaper rash can be caused by a bacterial infection. This is also called \n\n##### impetigo (/English/health-issues/conditions/skin/Pages/Impetigo.aspx). \n\n##### Certain types of bacteria (like staph (/English/health\n\n##### issues/conditions/infections/Pages/Staphylococcal-Infections.aspx) and strep \n\n##### (/English/health-issues/conditions/infections/Pages/group-a-streptococcal\n\n##### infections.aspx)) can cause diaper rash or make an existing one worse.

Allergy \n\n##### Occasionally, babies with sensitive skin may have an allergic reaction (/English/health\n\n##### issues/conditions/skin/Pages/Hives.aspx) to a specific ingredient in diapers, wipes, and/or creams. \n\n##### Common allergens include dyes or elastics in the diaper, and fragrances or preservatives in diaper \n\n##### wipes or creams. Clues that might suggest an allergy include a rash that happens after every \n\n##### exposure to that product and a rash that shows up everywhere that product is applied. Switching \n\n##### brands or types of products for a 2-week period can sometimes help sort this out. \n\n###### Image caption: allergic reaction to diaper wipes. \n\n## 5. Other rare types of diaper rashes \n\n##### There are rare conditions that can start as or mimic diaper rash. Examples include seborrheic dermatitis, which may \n\n##### involve overproduction of oil in the skin, and pediatric psoriasis (/English/health\n\n##### issues/conditions/skin/Pages/Psoriasis-Not-Eczema-Not-Allergy.aspx). Genetic conditions such as acrodermatitis \n\n##### enteropathica, an inherited form of zinc deficiency, may also cause rashes in the diaper area. \n\n## When to call the doctor: \n\n##### If your child's rash does not clear using the simple tips discussed, contact your child's doctor to see if a prescription \n\n##### medication is needed.

Neonatal intensive care unit mothers may \n\n#### also feel jealous of women who are still pregnant, or of mothers who have given birth to healthy term babies. \n\n#### If your birth didn’t happen as you planned, you and your partner may also mourn the loss of that planned birth \n\n#### experience. Many couples today plan who will attend the birth, how the environment will look, how they will manage \n\n#### the labor process, and how much medical intervention they desire. Some write detailed birth plans to convey their \n\n#### desires to their care providers. Unfortunately, your preterm or complicated birth may have required an abrupt, \n\n#### unplanned change to your experience. \n\n#### You may also feel the loss of your parenting role. Throughout pregnancy, you envisioned yourself as a parent. You \n\n#### pictured yourself and your partner playing with and caring for your baby. Now you must spend time with your baby in \n\n#### a foreign environment, touch your baby through an incubator porthole, and wait for someone else to tell you when it’s \n\n#### appropriate for you to hold or feed your baby.

Now you must develop a new dream of your growing family and different goals for marking progress. \n\n#### These new goals may be quite different (such as weaning off of oxygen or breastfeeding for the first time), and parents \n\n#### cannot set these new goals until they let go of the old dream of a healthy full-term infant. \n\n#### It may take time to get over these feelings of loss. Many revisit these feelings frequently—sometimes for years—often \n\n#### around the time of their baby’s birth. Again, this is a normal reaction for many NICU families. As with anger, it often \n\n#### helps to discuss and acknowledge these feelings of loss. You may find it helpful to talk with other parents who have \n\n#### had a baby in the NICU.

In \n\n#### addition, other NICU parents may be watching you to identify you with your baby and to compare your circumstances \n\n#### to theirs. This socialization is part of the getting-to-know-you process in the NICU.

Despite parental training in special care and close medical \n\n## follow-up, these infants are at significant risk for rehospitalization. A baby born weighing less \n\n## than 3 pounds, 5 ounces (1,500 grams) has almost a 40% chance of being rehospitalized during the \n\n## first year of life. \n\n## Depending on the underlying disease, statistics are similar for chronically ill or technology\n\n## dependent infants. This rate drops to about 10% after the first year. \n\n## These statistics are not meant to frighten you. Rather, they are to remind you that your baby may still have special \n\n## health needs at discharge and that going home, in reality, is just the beginning of a whole new set of challenges for you \n\n## and your family. \n\n## “Tommy was rehospitalized three times during his first year at home.

It can extend \n\n## to the face and diaper area, too, and when it does, pediatricians call \n\n## it seborrheic dermatitis (because it occurs where there are the \n\n## greatest number of oil producing sebaceous glands). Seborrheic \n\n## dermatitis is a noninfectious skin condition that's very common in infants, usually beginning in the first weeks of life \n\n## and slowly disappearing over a period of weeks or months. Unlike eczema (/English/health\n\n## issues/conditions/skin/Pages/Eczema.aspx) or contact dermatitis, it's rarely uncomfortable or itchy. \n\n## What Causes Cradle Cap? \n\n## No one knows for sure the exact cause of this rash.

This, along \n\n## with soft brushing, will help remove the scales. Stronger medicated shampoos (antiseborrhea shampoos \n\n## containing sulfur and 2 percent salicylic acid) may loosen the scales more quickly, but since they also can be \n\n## irritating, use them only after consulting your pediatrician. \n\n## Some parents have found using petroleum jelly or ointments beneficial. But baby oil is not very helpful or \n\n## necessary. In fact, while many parents tend to use unperfumed baby oil or mineral oil and do nothing else, doing \n\n## so allows scales to build up on the scalp, particularly over the soft spot on the back of the head, or fontanelle. \n\n## Your doctor also might prescribe a cortisone cream or lotion , such as 1 percent hydrocortisone cream. Once \n\n## the condition has improved, you can prevent it from recurring, in most cases, by continuing with frequent hair \n\n## washing with a mild baby shampoo. \n\n## Yeast Infections \n\n## Sometimes yeast infections occur on the affected skin, most likely in the crease areas rather than on the scalp. If this \n\n## occurs, the area will become extremely reddened and quite itchy. In this case, your pediatrician might prescribe a \n\n## medication such as an anti-yeast cream. \n\n## Outlook \n\n## Rest assured that seborrheic dermatitis is not a serious condition, or an infection. Nor is it an allergy to something \n\n## you're using, or due to poor hygiene.

Let your children know that if you pay for the device and the wireless \n\n### network, they have to friend you in exchange. \n\n### 4. Sometimes kids are more willing to talk about their peers than themselves. Asking questions about school \n\n### trends, friends and fads may yield more answers than direct questions about their own activities.

But that's not true. Dental decay in baby teeth can negatively affect permanent teeth and lead to future dental problems. \n\n## Teaching Good Dental Habits \n\n The best way to protect your child's teeth is to teach him good dental habits. With the proper coaching he'll quickly adopt good oral hygiene as a part of his daily routine (/English/healthy-living/oral-health/Pages/Brush-BookBed.aspx). However, while he may be an enthusiastic participant, he won't yet have the control or concentration to brush his teeth all by himself. You'll need to supervise and help him so that the brush removes all the plaque—the soft, sticky, bacteriacontaining deposits that accumulate on the teeth, causing tooth decay. Also, keep an eye out for areas of brown or white spots which might be signs of early decay. \n\n## Toothbrushing \n\n As soon as your child has a tooth you should be helping your child brush her teeth two times a day with a smear (size of a grain of rice) of fluoride toothpaste on a child-sized toothbrush that has soft bristles. There are brushes designed to address the different needs of children at all ages, ensuring that you can select a toothbrush that is appropriate for your child. \n\n## Amount of Toothpaste","metadata":{"id":394}}],["395",{"pageContent":"## Amount of Toothpaste \n\n At age 3, you can start using a pea-size amount of fluoride toothpaste (/English/healthy-living/oralhealth/Pages/Toothbrushing-Tips-for-Young-Children.aspx), which helps prevent cavities. If your child doesn't like the taste of the toothpaste, try another flavor. Also try to teach your child not to swallow it, although at this age they are often still too young to learn to rinse and spit. Swallowing too much fluoride toothpaste can make white or brown spots on your child's adult teeth. \n\n## Brushing Motion \n\n You'll hear all kinds of advice on whether the best brushing motion is up and down, back and forth, or around in circles. The truth is that the direction really doesn't matter. What's important is to clean each tooth thoroughly, top and bottom, inside and out. This is where you'll encounter resistance from your child, who probably will concentrate on only the front teeth that he can see. It may help to turn it into a game of \"find the hidden teeth.\" Incidentally, a child cannot brush his teeth without help until he's older—about six to eight years old. So be sure to supervise or do the actual brushing if necessary. \n\n## Too Much Sugar \n\n Besides regular toothbrushing with the right amount of fluoride toothpaste, your child's diet (/English/healthyliving/oral-health/Pages/Healthy-Teeth-and-Your-Childs-Diet.aspx) will play a key role in his dental health. And, of course, sugar is the big villain. The longer and more frequently his teeth are exposed to sugar, the greater the risk of cavities. \"Sticky sugar\" foods such as sticky caramel, toffee, gum, and dried fruit—particularly when it stays in \n\n\n3/9/23, 11:58 AM Dental Health & Hygiene for Young Children HealthyChildren.org \n\nhttps://healthychildren.org/English/healthy-living/oral-health/Pages/Teething-and-Dental-Hygiene.aspx 2/2","metadata":{"id":395}}],["396",{"pageContent":"3/9/23, 11:58 AM Dental Health & Hygiene for Young Children HealthyChildren.org \n\nhttps://healthychildren.org/English/healthy-living/oral-health/Pages/Teething-and-Dental-Hygiene.aspx 2/2 \n\n his mouth and bathes his teeth in sugar for hours—could do serious damage. Make sure to always brush your child's teeth after a sugary food item. In addition, do not allow your child to have any sugar-containing liquid in a sippy cup (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Discontinuing-the-Bottle.aspx) for a prolonged period. \n\n## Dental Checkups \n\n During regular well-child visits (/English/family-life/health-management/Pages/Well-Child-Care-A-Check-Up-forSuccess.aspx), the pediatrician will check your child's teeth and gums to ensure their health. If she notices problems, she may refer your child to a pediatric dentist (pedodontist) (/English/family-life/health-management/pediatricspecialists/Pages/What-is-a-Pediatric-Dentist.aspx) or a general dentist with an interest in treating the dental needs of children. Both the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommend that all children see a pediatric dentist and establish a \"dental home (/English/healthy-living/oralhealth/Pages/Why-Regular-Dental-Visits-Are-Important.aspx) \" by age one. \n\n As part of her dental checkup the dentist will make sure all teeth are developing normally and that there are no dental problems and give you further advice on proper hygiene. She also may apply a topical fluoride solution to provide extra protection against cavities. If you live in an area where the water (/English/healthy-living/oralhealth/Pages/Water-Fluoridation.aspx) is not fluoridated, she may prescribe fluoride drops or chewable tablets for your toddler. For more guidance on fluoride supplements, talk to your pediatrician. \n\n## Additional Information:","metadata":{"id":396}}],["397",{"pageContent":"## Additional Information: \n\n Toothbrushing Tips for Young Children (/English/healthy-living/oral-health/Pages/Toothbrushing-Tips-forYoung-Children.aspx) FAQ: Fluoride and Children (/English/healthy-living/oral-health/Pages/FAQ-Fluoride-and-Children.aspx) Why Regular Dental Visits Are Important (/English/healthy-living/oral-health/Pages/Why-Regular-DentalVisits-Are-Important.aspx) How to Prevent Tooth Decay in Your Baby (/English/ages-stages/baby/teething-tooth-care/Pages/How-toPrevent-Tooth-Decay-in-Your-Baby.aspx) Last Updated 10/14/2015 Source Caring for Your Baby and Young Child: Birth to Age 5, 6th Edition (Copyright © 2015 American Academy of Pediatrics) The information contained on this Web site should not be used as a substitute for the medical care and advice of your pediatrician.

Second \n\n## molars typically arrive around age twelve. One sealant application costs roughly half the price of a filling. \n\n## Teens who do develop cavities have less reason to dread the dentist’s chair than you might have when you were their \n\n## age.

Jana, MD, FAAP and Jennifer Shu, MD, FAAP \n\n## As a new parent, you may not have heard of the ongoing \n\n## cloth versus disposable diaper debate. Use of disposable \n\n## diapers has become so accepted as a modern-day \n\n## convenience that many parents wouldn't dream of \n\n## using a substitute. In contrast to 1955, when essentially \n\n## all American babies wore cloth diapers, an estimated \n\n## 90% (or even 95%) of 21st century American babies are \n\n## sporting the latest in disposable fashions. \n\n## While a simple internet search on the subject quickly \n\n## makes it clear how strongly some people feel about the \n\n## cloth versus disposable debate, we have no intention of taking sides. Instead, we figure we'd offer you some facts and \n\n## practical advice related to the use of each type, with the rest of our information weighted toward disposable use only \n\n## because it is applicable to a majority of parents these days. \n\n## Disposable. Disposable diapers are very absorbent, a feature that can be good and bad. Using them may mean \n\n## your baby's skin has less contact with pee and poop and may offer the added convenience of less frequent \n\n## changing. However, it may also be more difficult to monitor exactly how much your baby is peeing—a task that is \n\n## especially important during the newborn period, as well as when you're faced with watching for signs of \n\n## dehydration. \n\n## Some cloth diaper advocates argue that babies in disposable diapers have a much higher incidence of diaper rash \n\n## (presumably due to longer contact with diaper contents resulting from less frequent changing). Interestingly, \n\n## however, one of the commonly recommended approaches to treating Diaper rashes is for cloth diaper users to switch \n\n## to disposable. Also garnishing a lot of attention is the fact that “disposable\" diapers are not biodegradable, and billions \n\n## (with estimates around 20 billion diapers, or 3.5 million tons) make their way into landfills each year.","metadata":{"id":418}}],["419",{"pageContent":"## (with estimates around 20 billion diapers, or 3.5 million tons) make their way into landfills each year. \n\n## We have been happy to learn that some communities have begun recycling or responsibly composting used \n\n## disposable diapers, while some of the country's leading diaper makers seem to be making an effort to be more eco\n\n## friendly, improving everything from the materials they use to the amount, transport, and packaging of diapers. We \n\n## certainly hope that this sustainability-minded approach continues across the entire disposable diaper industry. \n\n## Cloth. Cloth diapers are supposedly more comfortable than disposable diapers (we say supposedly because \n\n## neither of us has any personal recollection, and we aren't exactly sure how one would otherwise prove such a \n\n## claim). Proponents also claim that babies who wear cloth diapers are five times less likely to develop diaper \n\n## rashes than their disposable diaper-clad counterparts. But unlike disposable diapers, cloth diapers are not as \n\n## absorbent, need to be changed more frequently, and usually need to be worn with an overlying stay-dry cover. \n\n## These covers typically come in the form of plastic, cotton, or terry cloth. \n\n## Do you see what I pee? \n\n## Disposable diapers these days are so effective at absorbing whatever pee may come their way, they can actually \n\n## pose a challenge to parents who are trying to keep close tabs on just how much their newborns are peeing. \n\n## Fortunately, some diaper brands now come with a colorfully effective solution: a strip on the diaper that changes \n\n## color when wet, allowing you to more clearly see when your baby pees. \n\n\n##### As for the materials used to make them, cloth diapers have long been made of cotton—a material that is notorious for \n\n##### requiring a lot of water to produce.

Then, during the second month, these movements will turn to genuine signals of pleasure and friendliness. \n\n## Your baby's first true smile \n\n If you've experienced your baby's first true smile, then you know it's a major turning point for both of you. All the sleepless nights and erratic days of these first weeks suddenly seem worthwhile, and you'll do everything in your power to keep those smiles coming. \n\n For her part, your baby will suddenly discover that just by moving her lips she can have \"conversations\" with you. Smiling will also give her another way besides crying to express her needs and exert control over what happens to her. The more engaged she is with you and your smiles and the rest of the world around her, the more her brain development advances, and the more she'll be distracted from internal sensations (hunger, gas, fatigue) that once strongly influenced her behavior. Her increasing socialization is further proof she enjoys and appreciates these new experiences.

And her favorites, naturally, will be her parents. Grandparents or familiar sitters may receive a hesitant smile at first, followed by coos and body talk. By contrast, strangers may receive no more than a curious stare or fleeting smile. This selective behavior shows she's starting to sort out who's who in her life. \n\n At about three or four months, she'll become intrigued by other children. If she has brothers or sisters, you'll see her beaming as they talk to her. This fascination with children will increase as she gets older. \n\n These early exchanges play an important part in her social and emotional development. By responding quickly and enthusiastically to her smiles and engaging her in these \"conversations,\" you'll let her know she's important to you, can trust you, and has a certain amount of control in her life. By recognizing her cues when she's \"talking,\" you'll also show you are interested in and value her. This contributes to her developing self-esteem. \n\n## How your baby communicates needs \n\n As your baby grows, communication will vary with her needs and desires. On a day-to-day basis you'll find she has three general levels of need, each of which shows a different side of her personality: \n\n When her needs are urgent—hunger or pain, for instance—she'll let you know. She may do this by screaming, whimpering, or using desperate body language. In time you'll learn to recognize these signals so quickly you usually can satisfy her almost before she knows what she wants.","metadata":{"id":440}}],["441",{"pageContent":"When your baby is peacefully asleep, or alert and entertaining herself, feel reassured you've met all her needs for the moment. This is a welcome opportunity to rest or take care of other business. Playing by herself provides you with wonderful opportunities to observe—from a distance—how she is developing important new skills such as reaching, tracking objects, or manipulating her hands. These activities set the stage for self-soothing, which will help her settle down and ultimately sleep through the night. These are especially important skills to learn for more colicky or difficult-to-console babies. \n\n Each day there will be periods when your baby's obvious needs are met but she's still fussy or fitful. She may whine, have agitated movements, or exhibit spurts of aimless activity between moments of calm. She probably won't even know what she wants, and any of several responses might help calm her.

First there’s the \n\n## one who’s open, affectionate, and outgoing with you. But then there’s another who’s anxious, \n\n## clinging, and easily frightened around unfamiliar people or objects. Some people may tell you \n\n## that your child is fearful or shy because you’re “spoiling” her, but don’t believe it. Her widely \n\n## diverse behavior patterns aren’t caused by you or your parenting style; they occur because she’s \n\n## now, for the first time, able to tell the difference between familiar and unfamiliar situations. If \n\n## anything, the predictable anxieties of this period are evidence of her healthy relationship with \n\n## you. \n\n## Anxiety around strangers is usually one of the first emotional milestones your baby will reach. You may think \n\n## something is wrong when this child of yours who, at the age of three months, interacted calmly with people she didn’t \n\n## know is now beginning to tense up when strangers come too close. This is normal for this age, and you need not worry. \n\n## Even relatives and frequent babysitters (/English/family-life/work-play/Pages/default.aspx) with whom your baby was \n\n## once comfortable may prompt her to hide or cry now, especially if they approach her hastily. \n\n## At about the same time, she’ll become much more “clutchy” about leaving you.

Once she gets a little older, her memory \n\n## of past experiences with you will comfort her when you’re gone, and she’ll be able to anticipate a reunion. But for now \n\n## she’s only aware of the present, so every time you leave her sight—even to go to the next room—she’ll fuss and cry. \n\n## When you leave her with someone else, she may scream as though her heart will break. At bedtime, she’ll refuse to \n\n## leave you to go to sleep, and then she may wake up searching for you in the middle of the night. \n\n## How long should you expect this separation anxiety to last? It usually peaks between ten and eighteen months and \n\n## then fades during the last half of the second year.

Fortunately, this emotional roller coaster eventually will \n\n## subside along with her separation anxiety. But in the meantime, try to downplay your leave-taking as much as possible. \n\n## Here are some suggestions that may help. \n\n## 1.

Many mothers experience an improvement in the pain and swelling of \n\n## engorgement within hours after using the cabbage. There is limited clinical research on the use of cabbage for \n\n## engorgement, and the exact way in which cabbage decreases breast swelling is unknown, but the treatment appears to \n\n## be harmless.

You should be able to draw a straight line that connects your baby's ear, \n\n## shoulder and hip on either side of their body. \n\n## Once you and your baby are in proper position, the next step is to guide them toward the breast so that they can latch \n\n## on properly and nurse. Latching on effectively is crucial to breastfeeding successfully because it prevents sore \n\n## nipples, ensures sufficient milk supply, and stimulates plentiful milk production. \n\n## In most cases (other than in the reclining position), you'll need to support your breast, at least in the early days of \n\n## breastfeeding.

You can provide gentle compression of the breast with your fingers to make it \n\n## easier for your baby to latch. \n\n## With the breast supported, stroke your baby's lower lip with your nipple or bring their chin in to touch the breast \n\n## closely. This causes your baby to open their mouth. (If their mouth stays closed, stroke their lip again, press gently \n\n## down on their chin with your index finger and open your own mouth, too, since they might imitate you.) \n\n## Once your baby opens wide—not just a little, but as though they're giving a big yawn—quickly draw them closer and \n\n## place their open mouth fully on your breast. This guiding movement should be quick but gentle. Remember that you \n\n## should bring your baby to your breast, not push your breast into their mouth. If your baby's head is pushed into the \n\n## breast so hard that they cannot breathe, they may become agitated or frightened. They may arch their back and refuse \n\n## to feed. Do not push on the baby's head, but keep your hand supporting their upper back and neck in place. \n\n## What does a good breastfeeding latch look like? \n\n## If your baby is in proper nursing position, their jaws will come together on your areola and their lips will seal over your \n\n## breast. Their chin should be touching your breast, and their nose will be close to your breast.

Helping them latch on in a slightly asymmetric fashion, so \n\n## that a bit more of the areola is in their mouth on the lower-lip side and a bit less on the upper-lip side, will position the \n\n## nipple so it points toward the roof of the baby's mouth. \n\n\n##### 3/9/23, 12:27 PM Ensuring Proper Latch On While Breastfeeding HealthyChildren.org","metadata":{"id":465}}],["466",{"pageContent":"## nipple so it points toward the roof of the baby's mouth. \n\n\n##### 3/9/23, 12:27 PM Ensuring Proper Latch On While Breastfeeding HealthyChildren.org \n\n##### https://healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/ensuring-proper-latch-on.aspx 2/2 \n\n## How do you fix a painful breastfeeding latch? \n\n#### You may feel slight discomfort when your baby first latches on and perhaps even for the first few sucks. But once they \n\n### begin to suckle steadily you should not feel pain. Pain beyond the first minute or so of nursing is a sign of improper \n\n### latching on and should be immediately corrected. You can practice more, or get help from your pediatrician, family \n\n### physician, nurse or lactation specialist. When pain persists throughout nursing, detach the baby by inserting your \n\n### finger in thecorner of their mouth to break the suction and relatch them. Make sure that their mouth is wide open \n\n### before latching. \n\n## Helping your baby open wider to latch \n\n#### The key to successful latching on involves your baby taking enough of the breast into the mouth. When this happens, \n\n#### the nipple is drawn to the back of the baby's mouth and his gums and tongue are compressing the areola, covering \n\n#### about an inch or two of the areola from the base of the nipple. When your baby is latched well, suckling begins with \n\n#### movements of their jaw and tongue to move the milk from the breast through the tiny holes in your nipple. To achieve \n\n#### this, your baby's mouth must truly be open wide as they latch on. Many early nursing mistakes occur when the \n\n#### mother hasn't waited until her baby's jaws are about as wide as they can be before she pulls the baby to the breast. As a \n\n#### result, the baby sucks on the nipple only, a position that limits the amount of milk received and soon makes the nipple \n\n#### sore. \n\n#### To help your baby take in a large mouthful, use your C-hold to gently compress your breast; this makes the areola","metadata":{"id":466}}],["467",{"pageContent":"#### sore. \n\n#### To help your baby take in a large mouthful, use your C-hold to gently compress your breast; this makes the areola \n\n#### narrower and the nipple stick out more so it is easier to grasp.

As they latch on, their tongue should stick out a bit, cover their lower \n\n#### gum and partially envelop the breast. Their lips should turn outward like a fish and press against your breast. \n\n## The latching learning curve \n\n#### Many new parents assume that infants are born knowing instinctively how to attach themselves to the breast—that if \n\n#### you present your breast the right way, they will know what to do.

Steele, M.D, FAAP, on staff at the \n\n## department of pediatrics at St. John’s Children’s Hospital in Springfield, Mo. “You won’t survive if you don’t put them \n\n## on the same schedule. If one wakes up to eat, you need to feed the other one. Otherwise, you won’t get any sleep,” says \n\n## Dr. Steele, also the father of twin boys. \n\n## The same SIDS-prevention rules apply to multiples as well — most importantly, babies should be put to sleep on their \n\n## back. “In many instances, putting both babies together to sleep is fine, and even preferable,” says Steele. “In our case, \n\n## it wasn’t... since one would often wake the other.” \n\n## Recruiting Help \n\n## The first six to eight weeks at home are often the most challenging for parents as babies develop a routine. Parents of \n\n## multiples often need additional help, even if one parent stays at home. \n\n## Help from family and friends in the early weeks makes things more manageable, advises Steele. “If you can get help — \n\n## even for part of the day or part of the night — it makes things a whole lot easier.”","metadata":{"id":472}}],["473",{"pageContent":"## even for part of the day or part of the night — it makes things a whole lot easier.” \n\n## If you don’t have immediate family in the area, try reaching out to friends and neighbors, suggests Flais. “You might \n\n## be surprised at who will volunteer to help you with specific tasks, like holding the babies or feeding them. Reaching \n\n## out and asking for help is important, especially in the first three months.” \n\n## Managing Individuality \n\n## Multiples can be hard to tell apart, even if they are not identical. Finding a way to identify each child early on will help \n\n## you tell them apart until their individual characteristics and personalities emerge. \n\n## “Our twin boys are identical, so when they were young we dressed them in distinct color themes of blues and reds,” \n\n## says Flais. “This helped family and friends when they came over and made it easier for everyone to call them by their \n\n## names, instead of referring to them as ‘the twins.’ It also helped me later when I was trying to label photographs.” \n\n## Encouraging individuality in twins and other multiples is important at every age. “In our home we make sure that \n\n## each child gets some one-on-one time each week,” says Flais. “It may be as simple as just taking one of them to the \n\n## store alone. They get a parent all to themselves, and feel like they’re being listened to, and you can better appreciate \n\n## them as individuals.” \n\n## Setting the Example \n\n## Multiples are naturally fascinating and attract a lot of attention from family, friends, and the public — creating a \n\n## unique set of concerns. Try to plan ahead and prepare for how you will respond to such attention. \n\n## “You get a lot of strange comments, and you just can’t let it faze you,” says Flais. “When I hear ‘Oh, you’ve got your \n\n## hands full,’ I reply, ‘They’re good kids, I’m very lucky.’ I don’t want them to hear negative comments and think they’re \n\n## a burden to me. How you respond in front of your kids is important.”","metadata":{"id":473}}],["474",{"pageContent":"## hands full,’ I reply, ‘They’re good kids, I’m very lucky.’ I don’t want them to hear negative comments and think they’re \n\n## a burden to me.

Most families get to choose \n\n### whether multiple siblings will share a classroom, and some states have legislation supporting this choice. “Personally, \n\n### I think our boys spend so much time together they appreciate the time apart, but I know other parents are really \n\n### adamant that their kids stay together,” says Flais. \n\n## Finding Support \n\n### Raising twins or multiples is easier with the right support. Meeting other parents of multiples in your area is an \n\n### invaluable way to share knowledge and experience, says Steele. “Find out if there’s a multiples group in your town, \n\n### look for clothing sales, and take advantage of opportunities to pick up things in duplicate.” \n\n## Seeing More Multiples? \n\n### It’s true, multiple births are on the rise.

When a potential problem arises, decide if it is really worth the battle; \n\n## some issues probably are not. For example, if your child wants to wear an old pair of sneakers to school rather than the \n\n## newer pair you recently bought her, or if she wants to wear her hair a little longer than you would prefer, you might \n\n## decide to let her have her way, choosing to take a stand on more important matters instead.

By age three, children are less likely to use eating—or not eating—to be defiant (/English/familylife/family-dynamics/communication-discipline/Pages/How-toShape-Manage-Young-Child-Behavior.aspx). Generally, (although almost certainly not always), they will learn to better interact, participate, and enjoy family meals (/English/family-life/familydynamics/Pages/Mealtime-as-Family-Time.aspx). \n\n## 5 Tips for Parents: \n\n Accept strong preferences about foods. Your three-year-old may be enthusiastic about eating, but he or she may have very specific food preferences. Some preferences may vary from day to day. For example, your child may gobble down a particular food one day, and then push away the same food the next day. She may ask for a certain food for several days in a row, and then insist that she doesn't like it anymore. As irritating as this behavior can feel, it is very typical for a three-year-old. It is best not to make an issue of it. Instead, continue to offer a variety of healthy foods, and let your child choose which of them and how much he or she will eat. \n\n Encourage, but don't force trying new foods. Offer very small amounts of a new food for your child to taste (an \"adventure bite\"), along with other foods he or she already likes. Do not expect your child to eat a full portion of an unfamiliar food.","metadata":{"id":493}}],["494",{"pageContent":"Offer nutritious food choices at every meal. As a parent, your job is to make sure that your three-year-old has nutritious food choices (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/The-5-Food-Groups-Sample-Choices.aspx) at every meal. After offering healthy options at the table, let him or her make the decision of how much to eat. If your child shows picky eating preferences (/English/ages-stages/toddler/nutrition/Pages/Picky-Eaters.aspx)— resisting vegetables, for example—don't get discouraged or frustrated. Keep offering a variety of healthy foods, even if your child did not like them before. Developing a taste for foods can require up to 15-20 repeated exposures. This is also an important time to establish healthy snacking (/English/agesstages/toddler/nutrition/Pages/Selecting-Snacks-for-Toddlers.aspx) and meal habits. \n\n Meals can be simple and nutritious. Remember, meals at this age don't need to be fancy. In fact, most threeyear-olds prefer simpler preparation. If you only a few minutes to prepare a meal, try simple meals that include a protein source, whole grain, fruit, vegetable, and dairy. For example, a turkey or peanut butter sandwich, a serving of carrots, an apple, and a glass of milk. A simple lunch like this takes less time to prepare than driving through a fast-food restaurant—and it is much healthier! \n\n Turn off the TV—especially at mealtimes. Television advertising can be a big challenge to your three-year-old's good nutrition. Young children are easily influenced by ads for unhealthy foods like sugary cereals, fast food, and sweets. The best way to avoid this is put in place a \"media curfew (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/How-toMake-a-Family-Media-Use-Plan.aspx)\" at mealtime and bedtime, putting all devices away or plugging them into a charging station for the night. \n\n## Additional Information from HealthyChildren.org:","metadata":{"id":494}}],["495",{"pageContent":"## Additional Information from HealthyChildren.org: \n\n Feeding & Nutrition Tips: 4-to 5-Year-Olds (/English/ages-stages/preschool/nutrition-fitness/Pages/Feeding-andNutrition-Your-4-to-5-Year-Old.aspx) \n\n 5 Great Reasons to Cook with Your Kids (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Cooking-With-YourChildren.aspx) \n\n\n3/9/23, 12:46 PM Feeding & Nutrition Tips: Your 3-Year-Old HealthyChildren.org \n\nhttps://healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/nutrition/Pages/Feeding-and-Nutrition-Your-Three-Year-Old.aspx 2/2 \n\n Preschoolers' Diets Shouldn't Be Fat-Free: Here's Why (/English/ages-stages/preschool/nutritionfitness/Pages/Reducing-Dietary-Fat-for-Preschoolers.aspx) \n\n Sample Menu for a Preschooler (/English/ages-stages/preschool/nutrition-fitness/Pages/Sample-One-DayMenu-for-a-Preschooler.aspx) \n\n 15 Tips to Survive the Terrible 3's (/English/ages-stages/preschool/Pages/Tips-to-Survive-the-Terrible-3s.aspx) Last Updated 12/29/2016 Source Section on Obesity (Copyright © 2016 American Academy of Pediatrics) The information contained on this Web site should not be used as a substitute for the medical care and advice of your pediatrician.

Once the babies are awake to eat, feed them at the same time, \n\n## with burp breaks throughout and a good burping session at the end. If you have a helping hand to \n\n## feed one twin while you feed the other, great. But if you are breastfeeding, or ever plan on being \n\n## alone with your twins, you’ll need to teach yourself how to feed both babies simultaneously. You \n\n## might as well start learning now! \n\n## The best way to feed both twins simultaneously is with a large twin-feeding pillow, which works for nursing and \n\n## bottlefeeding. It is a large U-shaped pillow with a firm foam core that fits around your waist and an opening at the \n\n## back. Most versions have a safety belt to latch in place so that the pillow remains snug to your body. Each twin gets his \n\n## or her own side and feeds in the football hold position. You will likely need help positioning the babies on the pillow in \n\n## the early days but you will learn how to position them by yourself with time. You will soon be very capable, handling \n\n## both babies safely simultaneously. If you’ve had a cesarean delivery, you may need to wait a week or so before starting \n\n## to use a twin-feeding pillow because the pillow’s front edge crosses your healing abdomen.

It is critical that you position yourself and the twins properly for feedings, \n\n## whether breastfeeding or bottle-feeding, to prevent backaches from poor posture. Hunching over for 20 minutes at a \n\n## time, 8 to 12 times a day, can really take its toll on your body! \n\n## When your twins wake up to eat, look at the clock and make a mental note of the time. Newborns often can only \n\n## tolerate being awake for an hour or an hour and a half at a stretch, 2 hours tops. The fact that they can only be awake \n\n## roughly 90 minutes at a time can help you adjust your twins to live on the same schedule. How is the time awake \n\n## spent? Feeding and burping will take quite some time (especially as mom and dad work on positioning the babies \n\n## correctly). After feeding and burping, the twins should get some time upright to help them digest their milk; this is a \n\n## nice time to interact and play with them.

Typically, this may be a teenager who is \n\n## looking to make some spending money. Here are tips to \n\n## keep in mind. \n\n## Teenage babysitters: advantages \n\n## & disadvantages \n\n## There is an advantage to having young people as \n\n## babysitters, since they are generally energetic, playful, \n\n## fun-loving and entertaining for your children. The \n\n## disadvantage is that they may be less strict than you are with discipline, and they may not be experienced in handling \n\n## problem situations. \n\n## If your child is close to 12 years old, you will need someone considerably older to babysit. A teenager only one or two \n\n## years older is not likely to have much authority. Be sure to speak with the parents of any teenager you are considering \n\n## hiring, to get a sense of how they handle responsibility. It is also a good idea to check with other families who have \n\n## used the teenager for babysitting. \n\n## A good strategy is to develop a list of two or three sitters who know your child and can be called upon if your regular \n\n## sitter is busy or ill. Make sure they all understand the rules that apply to sitting at your home regarding: \n\n## Media use (/English/fmp/Pages/MediaPlan.aspx) such as TV watching, internet usage and texting \n\n## Substance use like smoking (/English/health-issues/conditions/tobacco/Pages/Dangers-of-Secondhand\n\n## Smoke.aspx) or drinking (/English/ages-stages/teen/substance-abuse/Pages/Why-to-Have-the-Alcohol-Talk\n\n## Early.aspx) \n\n## Taking your child outside (/English/safety-prevention/on-the-go/Pages/default.aspx) \n\n## If you need a sitter on a regular basis \n\n## If you need a sitter on a more regular basis, you may need to employ an older person. Word of mouth, online agencies \n\n## (including background checks) and local colleges are a few ideas to recruit people. \n\n## Qualities to look for in a sitter","metadata":{"id":510}}],["511",{"pageContent":"## (including background checks) and local colleges are a few ideas to recruit people. \n\n## Qualities to look for in a sitter \n\n## In general, the sitter you choose should be mature, reliable and friendly with children. They should be someone with \n\n## whom your child enjoys spending time. As your child gets older, they should have some say in your selection of \n\n## caretakers. Kids are very smart and have great intuition about people; respect their opinion. \n\n## Interviewing a babysitter \n\n## Interview applicants thoroughly to get a sense of their reliability and competence. \n\n## Questions to ask: \n\n## Ask them about other positions they have held \n\n## The ages of children they have cared for \n\n## What their responsibilities included \n\n\n### How they would handle various situations (such as your child not wanting to do homework) \n\n### Activities they enjoy doing with children \n\n### If you think reading or singing to your child is important, look for a babysitter who enjoys these activities. Explain fully \n\n### your expectations—for example, will the child care involve housecleaning? Ask for and carefully check references. \n\n## Before your hire a sitter \n\n### If one person stands out among those you've interviewed, have them come for a \"visit\" while you are home. \n\n### Introduce them to your child, and pay them for an hour of child care while you are home as well. \n\n### Evaluate this first encounter in helping you determine if the person is a good fit for your family. \n\n### Later, ask your child about the sitter, and be sensitive to their comments. \n\n## How much to pay your babysitter \n\n### The hourly rate for babysitting varies from community to community. In general, pay should increase with \n\n### responsibility and with the competence of the babysitter. Caring for multiple children or adding household chores to \n\n### child care merits a higher hourly rate. In the weeks and months ahead, monitor your sitter and how they get along","metadata":{"id":511}}],["512",{"pageContent":"### child care merits a higher hourly rate. In the weeks and months ahead, monitor your sitter and how they get along \n\n### with your child. Give advice and suggestions, and reinforce their positive qualities and strengths. \n\n## Au pairs \n\n### Some families prefer to hire an \"au pair.\" Typically, this is a college-age person from another country who agrees to live \n\n### and work in the United States for a specified period of time (usually one year). While an au pair can be expensive, they \n\n### can bring cultural richness into your family. Recognize, however, that many of these individuals also need to be given \n\n### support and assistance in adjusting to the United States. To find an au pair, use an agency that specializes in these \n\n### placements. \n\n## Arrangements with neighbors, family & friends \n\n### Some families develop cooperative arrangements with neighbors or family friends who also have children. The \n\n### families take turns providing child care for one another. Even in these cases, be sure you are clear about the rules you \n\n### expect to be applied to your children. It is also helpful to keep track of how much child care each family is providing, \n\n### so no family feels that the exchange of service is out of balance. \n\n## Emergency numbers \n\n### No matter what kind of sitter you select, make sure that the person with whom you leave your child has a list of all \n\n### emergency phone numbers, including where you can be reached, and the names and numbers of trusted neighbors, \n\n### relatives, and your child's pediatrician. Make sure to have 911 and the national poison control center number (800\n\n### 222-1222) displayed on or near the phone at all times, or ask them add these numbers to their contacts. \n\n### Click here (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/Babysitting-Reminders.aspx) for a complete list of \n\n### babysitting reminders. \n\n## What if your child doesn't like the sitter?","metadata":{"id":512}}],["513",{"pageContent":"### Click here (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/Babysitting-Reminders.aspx) for a complete list of \n\n### babysitting reminders. \n\n## What if your child doesn't like the sitter? \n\n### What should you do if your child challenges the sitter's authority? First, find out exactly what happened, talking to \n\n### both the child and the sitter. In many circumstances, it will be appropriate to stand behind the sitter; a united front \n\n### aids the sitter's role as an authority figure.

Most babies grow very rapidly after regaining their birth weight, especially during growth spurts, which occur around seven to ten days and again between three and six weeks. The average newborn gains weight at a rate of 2⁄3 of an ounce (20–30 grams) per day and by one month weighs about ten pounds (4.5 kg). She grows between 1 1⁄2 and 2 inches (4.5 to 5 cm) during this month. Boys tend to weigh slightly more than girls (by less than 1 pound, or approximately 350 grams). They also tend to be slightly longer than girls at this age (by about 1⁄2 inch, or 1.25 cm). \n\n Your pediatrician will pay particular attention to your child’s head (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Your-BabysHead.aspx) growth, because it reflects the growth of her brain. The bones in your baby’s skull (/English/news/Pages/Prevention-and-Management-of-Skull-Deformities.aspx) are still growing together, and the skull is growing faster during the first four months than at any other time in her life. The average newborn’s head circumference measures about 13 3⁄4 inches (35 cm), growing to about 15 inches (38 cm) by one month.

If the bowlegged appearance is particularly severe or associated with pronounced curving of the front part of the foot, your pediatrician may suggest a splint or a cast (/English/health-issues/conditions/treatments/Pages/Caring-for-aCast.aspx) to correct it, but in most instances these circumstances are extremely unusual. \n\n If your baby was born vaginally (/English/ages-stages/prenatal/delivery-beyond/pages/Routine-VaginalDelivery.aspx) and her skull appeared misshapen at birth, it soon should resume its normal shape.

We realize that it's not always easy, fun, or \n\n## feasible, but it can be quite worthwhile to take the time and \n\n## figure out how much you're paying per ounce. You may be \n\n## surprised by what you find by comparing prices between \n\n## brands as well as by comparing types and sizes. Once you've \n\n## looked at the label and figured out how many total prepared \n\n## ounces you'll be getting in any given can or container, divide \n\n## the price by the total number of prepared ounces. Depending \n\n## on the retailer, the price per ounce may already be calculated and listed for your convenience right next to the \n\n## total price posted on the display shelf. \n\n## Stock up. To do this, you'll first want to make sure that your baby is perfectly content with the formula he's \n\n## getting. Then take advantage of any sales and coupons you may spot along the way. You'll want to remember to \n\n## check the expiration date printed on the cans before stocking up. While many will have expiration dates well \n\n## more than a year, you won't want to get stuck with a bunch of cans whose time will be up before you can use \n\n## them. \n\n## Save receipts.

After all, little \n\n## humans don't like letting go of familiar habits any more \n\n## than we do.

But there are many good reasons \n\n## not to give in when your child demands a bottle. \n\n## Why prolonged bottle feeding can cause health problems \n\n## Pediatricians and dentists stress the benefits of training your child to drink from a cup at mealtime as you gradually \n\n## reduce the number of bottle feedings. Ideally, this transition will begin around 6 months, when you offer your child a \n\n## cup for the first time. You will then reduce the number of bottle feedings slowly, completing the transition sometime \n\n## between 12 and 18 months. \n\n## Letting children bottle-feed longer than this can cause them to: \n\n## Skip meals. Little ones who sip on bottles during the day often don't feel hungry at mealtimes. This may mean \n\n## they're getting less of the fiber and rich nutrients found in solid foods. If you're begging your child to eat, bottles \n\n## might be the cause. \n\n## Reach an unhealthy weight. For many kids, bottles become high-calorie meal supplements and snacks, leading \n\n## to toddler obesity (/English/health-issues/conditions/obesity/Pages/childhood-obesity-a-complex-disease.aspx). \n\n## And while many people find chubby toddlers adorable, pediatricians point out that early obesity sets the stage for","metadata":{"id":551}}],["552",{"pageContent":"## And while many people find chubby toddlers adorable, pediatricians point out that early obesity sets the stage for \n\n## weight (and health) problems later in life. \n\n## Develop cavities.

Little ones who \n\n## drink from bottles well into their second year may also have tooth alignment problems and even speech delays, \n\n## since little mouths need to strengthen the muscles for clear speech. \n\n## Resist even more. Toddlers cling to their bottles even more fiercely as time goes by. This can trigger a major \n\n## power struggle between you and your child, so starting early is the healthiest path for both of you. \n\n## Tips for a smoother transition to drinking from a cup \n\n## The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that you offer your child a cup when they start eating solid \n\n## foods, usually around 6 months.

Giving \n\n#### your child plain water in bottles between meals and then moving to plain water in sippy cups or cups can help \n\n#### with the transition. \n\n#### Start offering a cup to your child as early as 6 months. Bring one to the table with your child's plate and \n\n#### encourage them to give it a try. Begin by putting formula or breast milk in their cup—whatever they're drinking \n\n#### already. (This might feel more natural than starting with water.) As they get the hang of things, you can fill their \n\n#### cup with plain water at mealtimes, too. \n\n#### Celebrate their success. Notice your little one's progress and offer them praise. If it feels right, put on party hats \n\n#### and sing a happy tune. Your child is eating and drinking like a big kid, which helps set the stage for lifelong \n\n#### health. Hooray! \n\n#### If your child balks, do a little investigating. Maybe they aren't thirsty when you offer them a mealtime drink, \n\n#### and that's okay. Model good habits by drinking water when you eat together.

Temporary sleep problems can turn into serious struggles if \n\n#### you give in to your child's protests and offer a bottle at bedtime. Create a healthy new routine when your little \n\n#### one can snuggle with you, listen to a story or soft music and drift off. A pacifier may also help. \n\n#### Offer healthy beverages. Plain water is the healthiest drink (https://www.mouthhealthy.org/en/nutrition/food\n\n#### tips/water-best-beverage) for your child, and the fluoride in tap water helps prevent tooth decay.

When reflux is associated with \n\n## other symptoms, or if it persists beyond infancy, it is considered a disease and is known as gastroesophageal reflux \n\n## disease or GERD. \n\n## GER in infants is not considered a disease and does not include a \"D.\" In fact, GER is considered normal. These infants \n\n## are known as \"happy spitters,\" because they are not cranky and do not appear to be in a great deal of pain when \n\n## spitting up. In fact, your baby may feel better after a good spit-up. Other symptoms of GER include mild feeding \n\n## problems, such as occasional prolonged feeds or interrupted feeds. \n\n## When is spit-up or GER normal? \n\n## GER usually begins at approximately 2 to 3 weeks of life and peaks between 4 to 5 months. Most babies who are born at \n\n## full term will have complete resolution of symptoms by the time they are 9 to 12 months old. \n\n## In most babies, GER disappears as the upper digestive tract functionally matures. In addition, normal development, \n\n## including improved head control and being able to sit up, as well as the introduction of solid food (/English/ages","metadata":{"id":559}}],["560",{"pageContent":"## including improved head control and being able to sit up, as well as the introduction of solid food (/English/ages\n\n## stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Starting-Solid-Foods.aspx), will help improve GER symptoms. \n\n## What are the causes of GER? \n\n## If your baby's stomach is full or his or her position is changed abruptly, especially after a feeding, the stomach \n\n## contents—food mixed with stomach acid—press against the valve at the top of the stomach. This is called the lower \n\n## esophageal sphincter. This ring of muscle normally relaxes to let food pass from the esophagus into the stomach and \n\n## then tightens again to keep the food there. When it is not fully developed or it opens at the wrong time, the stomach \n\n## contents move back or reflux into the esophagus. See Why Babies Spit Up (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding\n\n## nutrition/Pages/Why-Babies-Spit-Up.aspx) for more information on this. \n\n## In older children, diet can play more of a role. Large meals and highly acidic or spicy meals, as well as carbonated or \n\n## caffeinated beverages, can lead to increased GER symptoms. In addition, GER is more common in children who are \n\n## overweight or obese. \n\n## How do I know if my child has GERD? \n\n## Unlike GER, GERD is associated with complications from acid reflux. Call your pediatrician if your child exhibits any of \n\n## the following signs or symptoms: \n\n\n##### Refusal to feed \n\n##### Crying and/or arching the back during feeds (i.e., seems to be in pain) \n\n##### Blood or greenish color in the spit-up \n\n##### Increase in frequency or intensity of the spit-up (i.e., forceful) \n\n##### Belly is swollen or distended or feels hard \n\n##### Respiratory symptoms—including wheezing and coughing \n\n##### In addition, let your pediatrician know if you notice that your baby doesn't seem to be gaining weight or is having \n\n##### fewer wet and dirty diapers, as these may be signs that not enough of what he or she eats is staying down. \n\n## How will my pediatrician evaluate my baby for GER?","metadata":{"id":560}}],["561",{"pageContent":"##### fewer wet and dirty diapers, as these may be signs that not enough of what he or she eats is staying down. \n\n## How will my pediatrician evaluate my baby for GER? \n\n##### The AAP believes it is important for all pediatric health care providers to be able to properly identify and treat \n\n##### children with reflux symptoms, and to distinguish GER from more worrisome disorders to avoid unnecessary costs \n\n##### and treatments. \n\n##### Your child's pediatrician will review your child's symptoms and feeding patterns and assess your child's growth by \n\n##### plotting his or her weight and height on a growth chart (/English/health-issues/conditions/Glands-Growth\n\n##### Disorders/Pages/Growth-Charts-By-the-Numbers.aspx).

While it seems to \n\n## vary, we've found that quite a few babies are prone to \n\n## startling themselves awake from peaceful slumber. \n\n## That's because all babies are at the whim of their own \n\n## reflexes (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Newborn\n\n## Reflexes.aspx)—which, by definition, they cannot \n\n## control—and are born with one particularly \n\n## inconvenient reflex (the startle, or Moro, reflex). \n\n## The Moro reflex causes infants to jerk suddenly, flail \n\n## their arms and legs, and even cry out in response to being startled—hence the name.

Lay a thin baby blanket out like a diamond in front of you. \n\n## 2. Fold the top corner of the blanket down a bit so that the folded corner almost reaches the middle of the blanket. \n\n## 3.

Then take the bottom corner of the blanket (below your baby's feet) and fold it up over your baby. If the blanket is \n\n## large enough that the bottom corner reaches up to (or over) your baby's face, you can simply fold it back down \n\n## until their face is no longer covered or bring it over one or the other shoulder and tuck it under them. \n\n## 6. Finally, take the only remaining corner and pull it over your baby's other shoulder and across their body. Again, \n\n## tuck this corner snugly under your baby's opposite side. \n\n\n#### Once you have the general idea, remember that variations are perfectly acceptable.

Children living in poverty, in an ethnic or racial minority groups, or with special health care needs are at more risk for dental decay. There are other reasons a child could be high risk: \n\n The child's mother or main caregiver had tooth decay in the past 12 months or does not have a regular source of dental care. \n\n There are white spots on the child's teeth. These spots are a sign that the tooth is losing calcium and minerals that keep it strong. \n\n There are tan, brown or black spots or you see cavities (pits) on the teeth. This is a sign that the tooth is decaying. \n\n## How water helps prevent tooth decay","metadata":{"id":579}}],["580",{"pageContent":"There are tan, brown or black spots or you see cavities (pits) on the teeth. This is a sign that the tooth is decaying. \n\n## How water helps prevent tooth decay \n\n Fortunately, your family's tap water probably has fluoride added (https://ilikemyteeth.org/learn-share/) to it. Fluoride is a safe and useful cavity-fighting ingredient that has been added to drinking water since 1945 (https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/basics/anniversary.htm). \n\n Fluoride is a natural mineral that can slow down or stop cavities from forming. When you drink water (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Choose-Water-for-Healthy-Hydration.aspx) every day, the fluoride makes it hard for bacteria in your mouth to make acid. Fluoride also rebuilds tooth enamel (the outer layer of the tooth) and it even makes teeth stronger. \n\n Check with your local water utility agency to find out if your water has fluoride (/English/healthy-living/oralhealth/Pages/Water-Fluoridation.aspx). The health benefits work when the drinking water has 0.7 mg/L of fluoride. If your community water supply does not have fluoride or you live on a private well, ask your doctor if you should get a prescription for fluoride drops or chewable tablets for your child. \n\n## When to start using fluoride toothpaste \n\n As soon as your baby's first tooth erupts, it's time to start using fluoride toothpaste (/English/healthy-living/oralhealth/Pages/Toothbrushing-Tips-for-Young-Children.aspx). Here's how to do it: \n\n\n3/9/23, 11:59 AM Good Oral Health Starts Early: AAP Policy Explained HealthyChildren.org \n\nhttps://healthychildren.org/English/healthy-living/oral-health/Pages/Brushing-Up-on-Oral-Health-Never-Too-Early-to-Start.aspx 2/2 \n\n Use a tiny smear—the size of a grain of rice—until age 3.

It's best to clean them right after breakfast and before bedtime (/English/healthy-living/oral-health/Pages/Brush-Book-Bed.aspx).","metadata":{"id":580}}],["581",{"pageContent":"Use a pea-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste when your child is 3 years old. Teach your child to spit without rinsing. \n\n Assist or supervise kids during toothbrushing until they master the task, usually at around 10 years of age. \n\n### A toothbrush should be the last thing to touch your child's teeth every night.... \n\n Do not put your baby to bed with a bottle at night or at naptime. It is also not a good idea to let your baby use a bottle filled with a sweet drink or dip your baby's pacifier (/English/ages-stages/baby/crying-colic/Pages/Practical-PacifierPrinciples.aspx) in anything sweet like sugar or honey. If you do put your baby to bed with a bottle, fill it only with water. You can give your baby about 4-8 ounces of water per day (/English/healthyliving/nutrition/Pages/recommended-drinks-for-young-children-ages-0-5.aspx) starting at around 6 months. (Remember, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends breastfeeding as the sole source of nutrition for your baby for about 6 months.) \n\n## Special steps stop tooth decay in children \n\n When your baby is 6 months, your pediatrician will start to do oral health checkups and apply fluoride varnish (/English/healthy-living/oral-health/Pages/Fluoride-Varnish-What-Parents-Need-to-Know.aspx). Pediatricians are trained to apply fluoride varnish because many young children do not see or have access to a dentist until they are older. All infants and children should have fluoride varnish every 6 months until age 5. Children might need it every 3 months if they have a higher risk of dental decay. \n\n Varnish is used to help prevent or slow down tooth decay. It is painted on the top and sides of each tooth and hardens quickly. The process is safe and does not hurt. \n\n## Finding a dental home for your child","metadata":{"id":581}}],["582",{"pageContent":"## Finding a dental home for your child \n\n Oral health starts early.

Like any skill, \n\n## though, expressing milk gets easier each time you \n\n## practice it. \n\n## Milk can be expressed by hand, with a manual pump, or \n\n## with a battery-operated or electric breast pump.

Some parents find that expressing milk when they wake up in \n\n## the morning is easiest, since their milk is more abundant then. \n\n## To express by hand, first be sure that your hands and fingernails (preferably short) are clean by washing them with \n\n## soap and water. (You might even take a warm shower just before expressing, or place a clean, warm, moist towel over \n\n## your breasts to help you relax and encourage the milk to let down.) Then massage your breast slowly, starting at the \n\n## outer areas and working your way down toward the nipple. The massage should be gentle, never uncomfortable to \n\n## your breasts or your skin. \n\n## Next, place a clean cup or jar beneath the nipple so that the milk will drip directly into it without touching your hands \n\n## or your breast.

We now know that a normal, healthy diet is all it really takes for a \n\n## breastfeeding mother to maintain her milk supply and sustain both her baby’s and her own \n\n## health. Still, certain components of this normal diet are especially important when your body is \n\n## producing milk. \n\n## Calcium \n\n## Calcium is among the most important minerals in your diet. Your body stores of calcium (primarily from your bones) \n\n## supply much of the calcium in your breast milk to meet your baby’s calcium needs. Studies show that women lose 3 to \n\n## 5 percent of their bone mass when they are breastfeeding. After you finish breastfeeding, your body must replenish \n\n## the calcium that was used to produce your milk. Making sure you consume the recommended amount of calcium in a \n\n## normal diet—1,000 milligrams daily for all women ages eighteen to fifty and 1,300 milligrams for teenage mothers— \n\n## helps ensure that your bones will remain strong after you have weaned your baby. The good news is that you recover \n\n## the bone lost during breastfeeding within the six-month period after you wean your baby. \n\n## By consuming three servings of dairy products—8 ounces of milk is one serving—per day, you should receive the \n\n## calcium you need. If you dislike milk, you can get the calcium you need from cheese and yogurt. If you are allergic to \n\n## dairy products, try calcium-fortified juice, tofu, dark leafy greens such as spinach and kale, broccoli, or dried beans.","metadata":{"id":620}}],["621",{"pageContent":"## dairy products, try calcium-fortified juice, tofu, dark leafy greens such as spinach and kale, broccoli, or dried beans. \n\n## You can also get calcium in fortified foods such as breakfast cereal. (Contrary to popular myth, it is not necessary to \n\n## drink milk to make milk.) \n\n## If you do not routinely consume 1,000 milligrams of calcium in your diet, talk to your doctor or nutritionist about a \n\n## dietary supplement of calcium. (Avoid supplements made from crushed oyster shells, though, because of concern \n\n## about lead from these sources.) Consuming 1,000 milligrams of calcium daily—not only while breastfeeding but \n\n## throughout life until you reach menopause—will decrease your risk of osteoporosis in later life. \n\n## Vitamin D \n\n## Vitamin D—often known as the “sunshine vitamin”—is just as important as calcium when it comes to maintaining \n\n## bone strength. Vitamin D is essential for absorbing dietary calcium from your intestinal tract. The amount of vitamin \n\n## D you need depends on whom you ask. Most experts currently recommend getting at least 400 IU of vitamin D a day, \n\n## but some suggest getting as much as 1,000 IU. \n\n## Exposure to sunlight is one of the best ways to get your vitamin D, but it’s not the safest, given concerns about skin \n\n## cancer. It’s also unreliable and depends a great deal on where you live. Instead, you should look to get vitamin D from \n\n## foods such as salmon, mackerel, fortified milk or orange juice, and yogurt. Some ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are \n\n## fortified with vitamin D. You can get vitamin D from supplements, too. \n\n## Keep in mind, though, that your baby still needs vitamin D supplementation (/English/healthy\n\n## living/nutrition/Pages/Vitamin-D-And-Your-Baby.aspx), even if you’re taking a supplement.

Not wanting to eat broccoli is \n\n## rooted in a great deal of more complicated issues than \n\n## just not liking green food. How we come to like certain \n\n## foods is associated with many factors and is referred to \n\n## as food preferences. \n\n## How Food Preferences Are \n\n## Developed: \n\n## In the first 2 years of life—when learning is constantly taking place—food preferences are also forming. Most are \n\n## learned, but some are innate. A child's food preferences directly affect eating behavior, which in turn is linked to \n\n## overall health, wellness, and the formation of obesity. \n\n## For years now, the food and beverage industry has used this knowledge to their advantage and encourages the \n\n## development of unhealthy food preferences in children of all ages through various marketing and advertising \n\n## techniques. \n\n## The Food and Beverage Industry's Role in the Formation of Food \n\n## Preferences: \n\n## How often have you seen a food advertisement for broccoli? Healthy foods are advertised less than 3% of the time in \n\n## comparison to their counterparts. This has a direct impact on children's food preferences—considering food and \n\n## beverage companies spend $2 billion dollars a year on food marketing campaigns directed at children. \n\n## The fast food industry spends nearly 5 million dollars a day marketing products high in sugar, fat and salt, while also \n\n## suggesting portion sizes grossly disproportionate to a child's energy needs. Increasingly, fast food companies are also \n\n## using toy tie-ins with major children's motion pictures to try to attract young people. Remarkably, studies \n\n## demonstrate that even very young children exposed to persuasive ads can develop food cravings for unhealthy foods \n\n## that they have never even tasted!","metadata":{"id":630}}],["631",{"pageContent":"## demonstrate that even very young children exposed to persuasive ads can develop food cravings for unhealthy foods \n\n## that they have never even tasted! \n\n## This has a direct consequence on the formation of potentially lifelong, unhealthy food preferences associated with the \n\n## development of obesity and all that comes with it. Although food preferences can be unlearned, this is often a \n\n## monumental task as we age. \n\n## Regulation—or lack thereof \n\n## The marketing of food to children on media is unregulated in the U.S. Instead, major food and beverage \n\n## manufacturers have voluntarily pledged to limit child-directed marketing of unhealthy foods as part of the Children's \n\n## Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative (http://www.bbb.org/council/the-national-partner-program/national\n\n## advertising-review-services/childrens-food-and-beverage-advertising-initiative/). However, independent research \n\n## groups have highlighted several limitations of that program, and young children remain highly exposed to \n\n## advertisements for foods and beverages that may contribute to unhealthy food preferences. \n\n## The Problem with Baby and Toddler Snacks: \n\n## Reducing sodium and sugar intake early on can help set taste preferences and help children make healthy food \n\n## choices later in life. However, a report (http://www.uconnruddcenter.org/BabyFoodFACTS) from the UConn Rudd \n\n## Center for Food Policy & Obesity found only 4 out of 80 baby and toddler snacks met nutritious standards.

Your baby may give you such signals as often as every hour or so in the early \n\n## days after birth. \n\n## He should not go longer than about two to three hours during the day or four hours at night without a feeding. Even if \n\n## you have to wake him up, be sure he receives eight to twelve feedings in every twenty-four-hour period.

But, when you stop caring for yourself, your ability \n\n## to care for your child is impacted and your ability \n\n## to enjoy motherhood is impacted. \n\n## My Best Advice: Take Care of Yourself \n\n## As a pediatric hospitalist (/English/family-life/health\n\n## management/pediatric-specialists/Pages/What-is-a-Pediatric\n\n## Hospitalist.aspx), a good part of my career involves caring for new babies in two very different hospital settings. I have \n\n## been sending moms and babies home for 15 years now.

It's something that has a rippling effect for decades. It costs nothing, but saves society millions. It is something \n\n## that is so hard to do at times and yet so vital. \n\n## So, what is my \"best advice for new moms ever\"? Take care of yourself. That's it, four little words. \n\n## When you are pregnant, it is easy to see why this one idea is so very important. \n\n## The little baby growing inside of you is directly affected by what you eat, drink and do. \n\n## If you smoke (/English/ages-stages/prenatal/Pages/Where-We-Stand-Smoking-During-Pregnancy.aspx), the \n\n## baby gets exposed and doesn't grow as well. \n\n## If you are chronically stressed or depressed (/English/healthy-living/emotional-wellness/Building\n\n## Resilience/Pages/When-Things-Arent-Perfect-Caring-for-Yourself-Your-Children.aspx), your body's responsive \n\n## hormones cause a cascade of negative effects on your baby.","metadata":{"id":661}}],["662",{"pageContent":"## Resilience/Pages/When-Things-Arent-Perfect-Caring-for-Yourself-Your-Children.aspx), your body's responsive \n\n## hormones cause a cascade of negative effects on your baby. \n\n## If you eat poorly (/English/ages-stages/prenatal/Pages/Nutrition-and-Exercise-During-Pregnancy.aspx), the baby \n\n## is at risk for poor growth. \n\n## But once the baby is no longer a part of your body, it is easy to forget that tight association between how you care \n\n## for yourself and how you care for your child's health. \n\n## It Isn't Selfish to Take Time to Exercise! \n\n## A mom who is well rested, eats a healthy diet, gets plenty of exercise, maintains close relationships with friends and \n\n## gets help when she realizes she isn't coping well, is far more equipped to be the best mother she can be than one who \n\n## doesn't do those things. It isn't selfish to take time to exercise or to get an adequate sleep each night. \n\n## I can remember when I was in middle school waking up to my mom returning from a training run with stories of \"the \n\n## nice police man\" who followed her while she was running to make sure she was safe. My mom is a trusting soul, she \n\n## often ran at 4:00 AM. Looking back, now that I am a mom, three things about that memory are clear: \n\n## 1. I no longer think she was crazy for running at 4:00 AM. It was the only down time she had as a mom, and she took \n\n## advantage of it rather that choosing not to exercise. \n\n## 2. Her example and those memories are deeply ingrained in me as \"what moms do.\" \n\n## 3. That police man really was nice! Thank you officer for keeping her safe, so she could grow up to be a grandma! \n\n\n#### When I first became a mom, I didn't exercise. I felt it was selfish to take time away from the kids to do something for \n\n#### myself. I \"didn't have time to exercise (/English/healthy-living/fitness/Pages/Overcoming-Obstacles-to-Physical\n\n#### Activity.aspx) and be a good mom\" with three little children.

Going to the gym not to take care of myself mind you, but to be able to take care of \n\n#### them. \n\n## Your Children Are Watching You...

Sounds that remind babies of being inside the womb may be calming, such as a white noise device, the humming sound of a fan, or the recording of a heartbeat. \n\n Walk your baby in a body carrier or rock them. Calming motions remind babies of movements they felt in the womb. \n\n Avoid overfeeding your baby because this may also make them uncomfortable.

Crying can be tough to handle, especially if you're physically tired and mentally exhausted. \n\n Take a deep breath and count to 10. \n\n Place your baby in a safe place, such as crib or playpen without blankets and stuffed animals; leave the room; and let your baby cry alone for about 10 to 15 minutes. \n\n While your baby is in a safe place, consider some actions that may help calm you down. \n\n Listen to music for a few minutes. \n\n Call a friend or family member for emotional support. \n\n Do simple household chores, such as vacuuming or washing the dishes. \n\n If you have not calmed after 10 to 15 minutes, check on your baby but do not pick up your baby until you feel you have calmed down. \n\n When you have calmed down, go back and pick up your baby.

The next time the baby \n\n## urinates, this dressing usually will come off. Some pediatricians \n\n## recommend keeping a clean dressing over the area until the penis \n\n## is fully healed, while others advise leaving it off. The important thing is to keep the area as clean.

Both mean that the area \n\n## is healing normally. The redness and secretion disappear gradually within a week. \n\n## When to call the pediatrician \n\n## If the redness persists or there is swelling or crusted yellow sores, there may be an infection. This does not happen \n\n## often, but if you suspect an infection, consult your pediatrician. \n\n## After the circumcision has healed: \n\n## Usually, after the circumcision has healed, the penis requires no additional care.

Even though we are often \n\n## reminded that our children stop crying within minutes of our leave-taking, how many of you have felt like you’re \n\n## \"doing it all wrong\" when your child clings to your legs, sobs for you to stay, and mourns the parting? \n\n## As a working parent (/English/family-life/work-play/Pages/Working-Mothers.aspx), separation anxiety creates \n\n## questions for me. Although it is an entirely normal behavior and a beautiful sign of a meaningful attachment, \n\n## separation anxiety can be exquisitely unsettling for us all. \n\n## Here are facts about separation anxiety and tips to improve the transitions I’ve learned the hard way (I’ve made about \n\n## every mistake): \n\n## Facts about separation anxiety \n\n## Infants: Separation anxiety develops after a child gains an understanding of object permanence.

The leavetaking can be worse if your infant is hungry, tired, or not feeling well. \n\n## Keep transitions short and routine if it’s a tough day. \n\n## Toddlers: Many toddlers skip separation anxiety in infancy and start demonstrating challenges at 15 or 18 \n\n## months of age. Separations are more difficult when children are hungry, tired, or sick—which is most of \n\n## toddlerhood! As children develop independence during toddlerhood, they may become even more aware of \n\n## separations. Their behaviors at separations will be loud, tearful, and difficult to stop. \n\n## Preschoolers: By the time children are 3 years of age, most clearly understand the effect their anxiety or pleas at \n\n## separation have on us. It doesn’t mean they aren’t stressed, but they certainly are vying for a change. Be \n\n## consistent; don’t return to the room based on a child’s plea, and certainly don’t cancel plans based on separation \n\n## anxiety. Your ongoing consistency, explanations, and diligence to return when you say you will are key. \n\n## How to survive separation anxiety \n\n## Create quick good-bye rituals. Even if you have to do major-leaguebaseball–style hand movements, give triple \n\n## kisses at the cubby, or provide a special blanket or toy as you leave, keep the good-bye short and sweet. If you \n\n## linger, the transition time does too. So will the anxiety. \n\n## Be consistent. Try to do the same drop-off with the same ritual at the same time each day you separate to avoid \n\n## unexpected factors whenever you can. A routine can diminish the heartache and will allow your child to \n\n## simultaneously build trust in her independence and in you. \n\n\n##### 3/9/23, 12:43 PM How to Ease Your Child’s Separation Anxiety HealthyChildren.org \n\n##### https://healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/Pages/Soothing-Your-Childs-Separation-Anxiety.aspx 2/2","metadata":{"id":684}}],["685",{"pageContent":"##### https://healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/Pages/Soothing-Your-Childs-Separation-Anxiety.aspx 2/2 \n\n#### Attention: When separating, give your child full attention, be loving, and provide affection.

The problem with the side position is that your baby can roll more easily onto their stomach. Some parents worry that babies will choke when they're on their backs. But your baby's airway anatomy and their gag reflex will keep that from happening. Even babies with gastroesophageal reflux disease (/English/healthissues/conditions/abdominal/Pages/GERD-Reflux.aspx) (GERD) (/English/healthissues/conditions/abdominal/Pages/GERD-Reflux.aspx) should sleep flat on their backs. \n\n\n#### Safe Sleep for Your Baby: Every Nap & Every Night | American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)Safe Sleep for Your Baby: Every Nap & Every Night | American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) \n\nAlso keep in mind: \n\n A newborn should be placed skin-to-skin (/English/ages-stages/baby/preemie/Pages/About-Skin-to-SkinCare.aspx) with their mother as soon after birth as possible, for at least an hour.

Place your baby's crib, bassinet, portable crib or play yard in your bedroom, close to your bed. **The AAP recommends room sharing because it can decrease the risk of SIDS by as much as 50% and it's much safer than bed sharing.** Room sharing will also make it easier for you to feed, comfort and watch your baby. \n\n### Keep soft objects & loose bedding out of your baby's sleep area \n\nThese objects can increase your baby's risk of entrapment, suffocation or strangulation. This includes pillows and pillow-like toys, quilts, comforters, mattress toppers, non-fitted sheets, blankets, toys, bumper pads or related products that attach to crib slats or sides. \n\n If you're worried about your baby getting cold , you can dress them in layers of clothing or use a wearable blanket. In general, you should dress your baby in only one layer more than you're wearing. \n\n Don't use weighted blankets, sleepers, swaddles or other weighted objects on or near your baby. \n\n### Don't let your baby get overheated \n\nOverheating can increase the risk of SIDS. Your baby only needs one more layer than you would wear in the same environment to be comfortable. \n\n Check your baby for signs of overheating such as sweating, a hot chest or flushed skin. \n\n Don't put a hat on your baby while indoors once you're home from the hospital. \n\n Back to Top \n\n\n## Other ways to lower SIDS risk \n\nAlong with creating a safe sleep environment, here are some other ways to lower your baby's risk of SIDS:. \n\n### Feed your baby breast milk \n\nEvidence shows that human milk reduces the risk of SIDS. The longer you give your baby breast milk, the more protection it gives.","metadata":{"id":698}}],["699",{"pageContent":"### Feed your baby breast milk \n\nEvidence shows that human milk reduces the risk of SIDS. The longer you give your baby breast milk, the more protection it gives. \n\n Breastfeed or feed your baby expressed breast milk. The AAP recommends breastfeeding (/English/agesstages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Where-We-Stand-Breastfeeding.aspx) as the sole source of nutrition for your baby for about 6 months. \n\n Even after you add solid foods to your baby's diet, continue breastfeeding until they're at least 12 months, or longer if you and your baby desire. \n\n### Try giving your baby a pacifier at nap time and bedtime \n\nThis helps reduce the risk of SIDS, even if the pacifier falls out after your baby is asleep. But keep in mind: \n\n If your baby is breastfed, wait until breastfeeding is established before offering a pacifier (/English/safetyprevention/at-home/Pages/Pacifier-Safety.aspx). That means your milk supply is good, breastfeeding is comfortable and consistent, your baby is latching well and they're gaining weight like they should. If you're not breastfeeding your baby, you can start the pacifier whenever you like. \n\n It's OK if your baby doesn't want a pacifier. You can try offering again later, but some babies simply don't like them. If the pacifier falls out after your baby falls asleep, you don't have to put it back in. \n\n Don't hang a pacifier around your baby's neck or attach it to their clothing when they're sleeping. \n\n### Get regular prenatal care & avoid substance use during pregnancy \n\nThere's strong evidence that routine prenatal (/English/ages-stages/prenatal/Pages/default.aspx)care reduces your baby's risk of SIDS. Also, avoid alcohol, marijuana, opioids or illicit drugs during pregnancy and after your baby is born. The risk of SIDS is higher when babies are exposed to alcohol or illicit substances. \n\n### Don't smoke or use nicotine during pregnancy or after your baby is born","metadata":{"id":699}}],["700",{"pageContent":"### Don't smoke or use nicotine during pregnancy or after your baby is born \n\nSmoking while you're pregnant, and smoke in your baby's environment after birth, are significant risk factors for SIDS. Don't smoke anywhere near your baby, even if you're outside. This includes vaping and electronic cigarettes, which contain nicotine. Keep your car and home smoke-free (/English/healthissues/conditions/tobacco/Pages/Importance-of-Smoke-Free-Homes-and-Cars.aspx). Get rid of secondhand smoke in any areas your baby and other nonsmokers spend time. If you're a smoker or you smoked during pregnancy, remember that it's especially important that you don't bed share with your baby. The risk of SIDS is especially high, even when the smoker doesn't smoke in bed. \n\n### Schedule and go to all well-child care visits (/English/family-life/health\n\n### management/Pages/Well-Child-Care-A-Check-Up-for-Success.aspx) \n\nRegular check-ups (/English/ages-stages/Your-Childs-Checkups/Pages/default.aspx) help ensure your baby's growth and development is on track. In addition, your baby will receive important immunizations at these well-child visits (/English/family-life/health-management/Pages/Well-Child-Care-A-Check-Up-for-Success.aspx) with your pediatrician. Evidence suggests that infant vaccinations (/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/YourBabys-First-Vaccines.aspx) may help protect against SIDS. \n\n### Make sure your baby has tummy time while awake every day \n\nAn awake adult should supervise awake tummy time (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/back-to-sleep-tummyto-play.aspx). This helps with your baby's motor development and prevents flat head syndrome (/English/healthissues/conditions/Cleft-Craniofacial/Pages/Positional-Skull-Deformities-and-Torticollis.aspx). Start with a short amount of tummy time soon after you get home from the hospital. Gradually increase the time until your baby is doing at least 15 to 30 minutes of tummy time every day by the time they're 7 weeks old.","metadata":{"id":700}}],["701",{"pageContent":"### Swaddle your baby if you like \n\nJust keep in mind that swaddling (/English/ages-stages/baby/diapers-clothing/Pages/Swaddling-Is-it-Safe.aspx) doesn't reduce the risk of SIDS. \n\n Back to Top \n\n\n Make sure that your baby is always on their back when swaddled (/English/ages-stages/baby/diapersclothing/Pages/swaddling-is-it-safe.aspx). \n\n The swaddle should not be too tight or make it hard for your baby to breathe or move their hips. \n\n When your baby looks like they're trying to roll over , you should stop swaddling them. The risk of suffocation is higher if your baby rolls to their stomach while they're swaddled. Rolling over usually happens around 3 to 4 months, but it can happen earlier. \n\n Don't use weighted swaddle blankets or weighted objects like rice bags (/English/tips-tools/ask-thepediatrician/Pages/bag-of-rice-on-a-baby’s-tummy-to-help-them-sleep.aspx) inside the swaddle. \n\n### Be cautious when buying certain products \n\n Avoid baby products that aren't consistent with safe sleep recommendations. This is especially true for products that claim to reduce the risk of SIDS or other sleep-related infant deaths. There's just no evidence that this is true. If you're not sure about a specific product, check the CPSC website (https://www.cpsc.gov/). \n\n Don't use home cardiorespiratory monitors as a way to reduce the risk of SIDS. You can buy consumer wellness devices such as heart rate and pulse oximetry monitors. Some of these are wearable. But remember, there is no evidence that these devices work to decrease SIDS risk. They don't have to meet the same requirements as medical devices either. Be aware that these devices can give you a false sense of security. It's fine to use one if you want to, just don't use it as a substitute for following all the above safe sleep guidelines. \n\n## Remember \n\nDon't hesitate to talk with your pediatrician if you have any questions or concerns about the safety of your baby's sleep environment. \n\n## More information","metadata":{"id":701}}],["702",{"pageContent":"## Remember \n\nDon't hesitate to talk with your pediatrician if you have any questions or concerns about the safety of your baby's sleep environment. \n\n## More information \n\n Ask the Pediatrician: Are some babies at higher risk for SIDS?

That's a lot of sugar―and half of that comes from drinks with added sugar! \n\n## What's Added Sugar? \n\n Many foods or beverages have extra sugar and syrups added to them when they are processed or prepared. These added sugars have many different names, such as brown sugar, corn sweetener, corn syrup, dextrose, fructose, glucose, high-fructose corn syrup, honey, lactose, malt syrup, maltose, molasses, raw sugar, and sucrose. \n\n In a joint policy statement (http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2019-0282), the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Heart Association explain the health consequences of this added sugar problem and what can be done to reduce kids' consumption of sugary drinks. \n\n## Here are ideas for how you can help your family reduce their added \n\n## sugar intake: \n\n Read nutrition facts labels carefully. Many foods now list added sugar separately. You also can find added sugar by reading the ingredients. Aim for less than 25 grams (about 6 teaspoons) of added sugar per day for children 2 years of age and older. Avoid serving foods and drinks with added sugar to children under 2 years of age. Learn more about nutrition facts labels here (/English/healthyliving/nutrition/Pages/Front-of-Package-NutritionLabels.aspx). \n\n Serve water (/English/healthyliving/nutrition/Pages/Choose-Water-for-HealthyHydration.aspx)and milk. Avoid soda, sports drinks, sweet tea, sweetened coffee, and fruit drinks. Milk contains natural sugar (lactose) and provides calcium, protein, vitamin D, and other nutrients children need.","metadata":{"id":715}}],["716",{"pageContent":"Limit fruit juice (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Fruit-Juice-and-Your-Childs-Diet.aspx). It has more sugar per serving than whole fruit. The AAP recommends no more than 4 ounces of 100% fruit juice a day for children ages 1 through 3 years; 4 to 6 ounces for children ages 4 through 6; and 8 ounces for children ages 7 through 14. Do not give fruit juice to infants under 1 year old. \n\n Go fresh and limit processed, pre-packed food and drinks. Sugar is often added to them while they are being made or at the table. For example, there are hidden sources of added sugar in processed foods like ketchup, dried cranberries, salad dressing, and baked beans. \n\n Satisfy your child's sweet tooth (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/How-to-Tame-Your-Childs-SweetTooth.aspx) with whole fruit. \n\n\n3/9/23, 11:29 AM How to Reduce Added Sugar in Your Child’s Diet: AAP Tips HealthyChildren.org \n\nhttps://healthychildren.org/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/How-to-Reduce-Added-Sugar-in-Your-Childs-Diet.aspx 2/2 \n\n## Marketing Sugary Drinks to Kids―A Problem: \n\n Beverage companies spend millions in marketing (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/5-Unhealthy-Ways-DigitalAds-May-Be-Targeting-Your-Child.aspx) to adults and children. Most teens see at least one ad for a sugary drink every day, according to the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity (http://www.uconnruddcenter.org/). Kids from minority and low-income communities are at a greater risk due to the low-cost, easy access to sugary beverages.

When she senses that she’s about to wet her diaper, she gets a funny look on her face \n\n## and sometimes drops into a squatting position. When she’s about to have a bowel movement, she \n\n## runs and hides behind the couch. She’s even figured out how to get her diaper off and loves to run \n\n## around the house naked whenever she gets the chance. Lindy’s parents agree that this seems to \n\n## be the perfect time to start. Yet when they point out the potty in the bathroom to Lindy and \n\n## suggest that she sit on it for a while, she just laughs and runs away. She’d rather risk an accident— \n\n## and her parents’ annoyance—than sit still long enough to use the bathroom. \n\n## Determining the best time to begin toilet training is not always easy—not only because readiness occurs at different \n\n## ages for different children, but because your child may be ready in one area of development but not in another.

Changing your baby’s diaper, taking a temperature, tucking in blankets, \n\n## changing clothes, and giving a bath are all skills you will learn; let your nurse know when you are \n\n## ready to begin learning how to provide these care needs. \n\n## Some parents fear that asking to participate in the care of their baby will “get in the way” of the nurse. Remember that \n\n## you are your baby’s parent. Your baby will go home with you, not the nurses. Rest assured that most nurses are eager \n\n## to help you become “the expert” in your baby’s care. Sometimes participation is simply “being there.” \n\n## Ask about your baby’s schedule, particularly about when feedings are provided, and when your baby is more awake. \n\n## Some NICUs welcome parents’ presence during procedures (IV starts, placement of peripherally inserted central \n\n## catheters, intubation).

Examples include \n\n## inclined sleepers, positioners and crib bumpers. \n\n## Each year, about 3,400 infants \n\n## (https://www.cdc.gov/sids/data.htm) in the United \n\n## States die unexpectedly during sleep. This can happen \n\n## from accidental suffocation, sudden infant death \n\n## syndrome (SIDS) or unknown causes. \n\n## To help prevent these deaths, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends \n\n## (https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/138/5/e20162938) that all infants should sleep on flat and firm \n\n## surfaces. Babies should sleep by themselves, without any bumpers, soft bedding, pillows or stuffed toys. Crib \n\n## bumpers and inclined infant sleeper products can cause a baby to suffocate. We also advise against using products \n\n## that are for infant bedsharing (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/a-parents-guide-to-safe-sleep.aspx) with \n\n## parents. \n\n## Here's why inclined sleepers, crib bumpers and other dangerous infant sleep products should stay off your registry \n\n## and out of your home. \n\n## Inclined baby sleepers and positioners \n\n## These are sometimes called baby nests, docks, pods, loungers, rockers or nappers. Infant positioners and inclined \n\n## sleepers have been popular items on baby registry lists for years. \n\n## The CPSC says (https://www.cpsc.gov/SafeSleep) that sleep products that incline more than 10 degrees are not safe. \n\n## Soft and plush sleep surfaces are also dangerous. Inclined sleepers allow babies to sleep at a 30-degree angle. Infants \n\n## placed in these products may fall asleep in a chin-to-chest position, which can restrict their airway.

In \n\n##### January 2023, the CPSC once again announced a recall (https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2023/Fisher-Price\n\n##### Reannounces-Recall-of-4-7-Million-Rock-n-Play-Sleepers-At-Least-Eight-Deaths-Occurred-After-Recall) involving \n\n##### 4.7 million of these sleepers.

They were originally intended to cushion babies from \n\n##### the crib slats. Crib bumpers are dangerous because of the risk of suffocation, entrapment, and strangulation. Plus, \n\n##### older babies may use the bumpers to stand on and climb out of the crib, creating a fall risk.

But even these can \n\n##### get loose and become a strangulation risk. Babies can also get trapped between them and the crib mattress. \n\n##### There is no evidence that crib bumpers—of any kind—prevent injury in young infants. \n\n##### Cribs today are regulated by the CPSC and have updated safety standards. The slats are closer together to prevent \n\n##### your baby's head from getting stuck. This means that bumpers are not only dangerous, but unnecessary.

The ability to stay dry through the night will follow a bit later, with most \n\n## girls and more than 75 percent of boys fully mastering this ability by around age six. \n\n## Your child, too, will move more or less steadily from diapers to underwear, from potty to toilet, \n\n## and from daytime to full-time management of his elimination processes. Many parents find, in \n\n## fact, that once their child grasps the concept of one form of elimination, mastery in the other \n\n## areas follows with greater ease (yet still on its own schedule). Soon your child will announce \n\n## confidently in restaurants and airports that he needs to find a bathroom, will lead you by the hand to the restroom, and \n\n## will confidently use a toilet he’s never seen before. \n\n## In the meantime, your continued support and sensitivity to his needs will encourage his progress. As he moves from a \n\n## potty to the adult toilet at home, provide him with a stepstool if he needs it and a child-size toilet seat. (The age at \n\n## which this transition occurs will depend on your child’s interest, your needs, and environmental requirements such \n\n## as the need to use adult-style toilets more frequently outside the home.) \n\n## When he needs to use the toilet away from home, accompany and assist him, making sure that he follows the same \n\n## routine (wipe, flush, wash hands) he’s learned at home.

Seeing a \n\n## hemangioma develop can be worrisome for new parents. \n\n## The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines \n\n## (http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2018 \n\n## -3475) say it's important to identify and begin monitoring \n\n## infantile hemangiomas right after they appear―when they \n\n## tend to change most quickly. \n\n## While hemangiomas can vary a lot in size, appearance, and \n\n## placement, they are universally benign (non-cancerous). Most will go away on their own without causing any \n\n## problems. Some hemangiomas―particularly those on the face or those that are very large―need treatment early to \n\n## prevent them from interfering with body functions or causing permanent scars. Thankfully, there are excellent \n\n## treatments available today to can prevent these problems if treated early on. \n\n## About Infantile Hemangiomas: \n\n## Infantile hemangiomas appear after a baby is born, typically within a month. Roughly 4% to 5% of all infants get them, \n\n## although they are more common in Caucasians, girls, twins, and preterm or low-birth-weight babies. Infantile \n\n## hemangiomas typically go through a period of rapid growth, followed by more gradual fading and flattening. \n\n## There are different types of infantile hemangiomas: \n\n## Superficial hemangiomas have been called \"strawberry marks,\" because they can resemble the surface of \n\n## berries. They may begin as small white, pink, or red areas on the skin that quickly change into brighter red, \n\n## raised lesions. Superficial hemangiomas may be focused in one spot or spread out over a larger area.","metadata":{"id":777}}],["778",{"pageContent":"## raised lesions. Superficial hemangiomas may be focused in one spot or spread out over a larger area. \n\n## Deep hemangiomas have a smooth surface and form under the skin. They may have a bluish tint and resemble \n\n## bruises. Some cause the skin to look swollen. \n\n## Mixed hemangiomas are a combination of superficial and deep growths. \n\n## Are there other birthmarks like it? \n\n## Some of the other marks that can show up on a baby's skin include port wine stains (/English/ages\n\n## stages/baby/bathing-skin-care/Pages/Your-Newborns-Skin-Birthmarks-and-Rashes.aspx) and \"stork bites \n\n## (/English/ages-stages/baby/bathing-skin-care/Pages/Your-Newborns-Skin-Birthmarks-and-Rashes.aspx).\" These also \n\n\n#### are caused when more blood than usual floods the capillaries under the skin. Port wine stains turn a reddish-purple \n\n#### and are often permanent; like hemangiomas, stork bites usually disappear, but can remain if they're on the back of the \n\n#### neck. \n\n## What to do if you think your baby has an infantile hemangioma: \n\n#### Infantile hemangiomas usually become noticeable by 4 weeks of age. They may start out looking like a tiny bump or \n\n#### scratch. But many then grow especially fast between 5 and 7 weeks old. If you think your baby might have a \n\n#### hemangioma, it's best to contact your baby's pediatrician right away. He or she probably will want to see your \n\n#### baby within a short timeframe. According to the AAP, the best \"window of opportunity\" to be evaluated and start \n\n#### treatment if needed is about 1 month of age. \n\n### Your pediatrician will want to know: \n\n#### Size: Is the hemangioma small (3/4\" or less across) or larger? \n\n#### Location: Is it located on the face or in the diaper area, or in a different area? \n\n#### Number: Is there one or more than one? If more than one, how many? \n\n#### If your doctor can't see you in the office right away, they may ask you to send photos or recommend a telemedicine","metadata":{"id":778}}],["779",{"pageContent":"#### Number: Is there one or more than one?

Superficial hemangiomas typically \n\n#### reach their full size by 5 months of age, although deep hemangiomas sometimes keep growing a while longer. In \n\n#### some cases, your pediatrician may give a referral to an infantile hemangioma specialist with expertise in pediatric \n\n#### dermatology (/English/family-life/health-management/pediatric-specialists/Pages/What-is-a-Pediatric\n\n#### Dermatologist.aspx), hematology-oncology, otolaryngology, or plastic surgery (/English/family-life/health\n\n#### management/pediatric-specialists/Pages/What-is-a-Pediatric-Plastic-Surgeon.aspx). \n\n#### By the time a baby is 6-18 months old, most hemangiomas begin to slowly improve. In a process called \"involution,\" the \n\n#### hemangioma will become less red and more grey or whitish and gradually flatten and shrink from the center outward. \n\n#### Each case is different. Most hemangiomas have finished or almost finished flattening and shrinking by 4 to 5 \n\n#### years of age. \n\n## When does a hemangioma need to be treated? \n\n#### Whether a hemangioma needs treatment depends on the age of the baby, where the hemangioma is located and how \n\n#### fast it is growing, whether it becomes sore or scabby, and the risk of it causing medical complications with a child's \n\n#### health and well-being. \n\n### There are 3 main reasons for treatment: \n\n#### Medical problems.

Hemangiomas near the child's eyes, nose or mouth, for \n\n#### example, can affect the child's ability to see, eat, breath or hear well. In rare cases, hemangiomas grow inside the \n\n#### body, which may need to be monitored with imaging tests (/English/health\n\n#### issues/conditions/treatments/Pages/Imaging-Tests.aspx). \n\n#### Skin breakdown. Sometimes, skin on the hemangioma's surface breaks down and becomes an open sore (called \n\n#### an ulcer) that could lead to bleeding, infection, or scarring. \n\n#### Permanent skin changes. Changes in the skin's texture or color can remain even after the hemangioma has \n\n#### gone away. This can be a concern, especially for hemangiomas on the child's face. Large hemangiomas on facial \n\n#### features such as the nose or lip can also distort growth. \n\n##### Back to Top \n\n\n## What kinds of treatments are available for hemangiomas? \n\n#### If a baby's hemangioma risks causing problems, medications can be applied directly to the skin or taken by mouth. \n\n#### The goal is to keep them from getting any bigger during their period of rapid growth, or to make them shrink more \n\n#### quickly. Laser procedures or surgery may be an option in some cases, although it generally is avoided during early \n\n#### infancy to avoid increased anesthesia risks. \n\n### Systemic treatments \n\n#### Propranolol , a beta blocker medication used for many years to treat high blood pressure, is now commonly \n\n#### given by mouth as an effective treatment for problem hemangiomas. To avoid a growth rebound, the pediatrician \n\n#### may recommend therapy continue until your child's first birthday. The drug must be used with close observation \n\n#### by your healthcare provider to watch for possible side effects and complications. \n\n#### Oral steroids have been largely replaced by safer and more effective options, but are still used in select cases, \n\n#### determined by the healthcare provider. \n\n### Localized treatments","metadata":{"id":780}}],["781",{"pageContent":"#### Oral steroids have been largely replaced by safer and more effective options, but are still used in select cases, \n\n#### determined by the healthcare provider. \n\n### Localized treatments \n\n#### Topical medications applied directly on the skin may be used for small, superficial hemangiomas.

Many mothers find that this works better if someone else offers the baby the \n\n## bottle at first, somewhere other than where he usually breastfeeds. (That way, he will have none of \n\n## the usual cues to start seeking out the breast.) Clearly, this is an excellent time to enlist the aid of \n\n## your partner or other loved one who has been eager to feed him, or perhaps to invite the baby’s \n\n## future caregiver to start establishing a feeding relationship with him. \n\n## During the first few attempts, have this person offer about ½ ounce of breast milk an hour or two \n\n## after a regular feeding, when your baby is alert and motivated to try this new feeding method but \n\n## not so hungry that he’s upset and frantic. The adult should take care to keep a calm and reassuring manner. A smiling \n\n## face and soothing voice will help your baby relax. It sometimes helps to drip a little familiar-tasting breast milk on the \n\n## baby’s lips or tongue at first to give him an idea of what you are doing. Then slowly and gently introduce the nipple \n\n## into his mouth. Your baby should be allowed to explore the nipple with his mouth, not have it forced past his gums. \n\n## Stop the attempt if he becomes frustrated or if more than ten minutes pass and he hasn’t fed. It’s better to end on a \n\n## positive note and try again the next day than to create an association between this new method of feeding and feelings \n\n## of frustration. \n\n## If after a few daily attempts he still refuses to drink from the container you’ve offered, try changing to a different kind \n\n## of nipple or from a bottle to a cup.

It happens when a \n\n## chemical called bilirubin builds up in the baby's blood. \n\n## Read on for answers to some common questions \n\n## parents have about this condition and how its treated. \n\n## Why is jaundice common in \n\n## newborns? \n\n## Everyone's blood contains bilirubin, which comes from \n\n## red blood cells and is removed by the liver. Before birth, the mother's liver does this for the baby. Most babies develop \n\n## jaundice in the first few days after birth because it takes a few days for the baby's liver to get better at removing \n\n## bilirubin. \n\n## How can I tell if my baby has jaundice? \n\n## The skin of a baby with jaundice usually appears yellow. The best way to see jaundice is in white light, such as daylight \n\n## or under fluorescent lights. Jaundice usually appears first in the face and then moves to the chest, abdomen, arms and \n\n## legs as the bilirubin level increases. The whites of the eyes may also be yellow. Jaundice may be harder to see in babies \n\n## with darker skin color. \n\n## Can jaundice hurt my newborn? \n\n## Most babies have mild jaundice that is harmless. But in rare cases, the bilirubin level can get very high and might \n\n## cause brain damage. This is why testing bilirubin levels as recommended is important. \n\n## Does breastfeeding affect jaundice? \n\n## Breast milk (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Where-We-Stand-Breastfeeding.aspx) (human milk) is \n\n## the ideal food for your baby. Jaundice is more common in babies who are breastfed than babies who are formula-fed. \n\n## This happens more often in newborns who are not getting enough breast milk because their mothers are not \n\n## producing enough milk (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/low-breast-milk-supply.aspx) (especially if","metadata":{"id":801}}],["802",{"pageContent":"## producing enough milk (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/low-breast-milk-supply.aspx) (especially if \n\n## the milk comes in late) or if breastfeeding is not going well, such as babies not latching on properly. \n\n## For the first 24 hours after birth, normal breastfed newborns receive only about 1 teaspoon of milk with each feeding. \n\n## The amount (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/How-to-Tell-if-Baby-is-Getting-Enough-Milk.aspx) of \n\n## breast milk provided increases with each day. If you are breastfeeding, you should breastfeed your baby at least 8 to 12 \n\n## times a day for the first few days. This will help you produce enough milk and will help keep the baby's bilirubin level \n\n## down. If you are having trouble breastfeeding, ask your baby's doctor or nurse or a lactation specialist for help. \n\n## When should my baby's bilirubin level be measured? \n\n## Any baby that has jaundice in the first 24 hours after birth should have the bilirubin level measured right away. All \n\n## babies should have at least one bilirubin measurement with skin or blood test before discharge from the hospital. \n\n## Whether a baby needs additional bilirubin levels measured depends on the baby's age, the level of bilirubin, and \n\n## whether the baby has other things that make jaundice more likely. \n\n## It is important for your baby to get checked soon after leaving the hospital. In most cases, babies discharged before 48 \n\n## hours should be seen within 2 days by a healthcare provider. Ask your baby's healthcare provider about their bilirubin \n\n## level and schedule a follow-up appointment. \n\n\n## Why do some babies need an earlier follow-up visit after leaving the \n\n## hospital? \n\n#### Some babies have a greater risk for high levels of bilirubin and may need to be seen sooner after discharge from the \n\n#### hospital.

Don't splash, don't play with your \n\n## food, don't underfund your 401-K, it's all just a drag. This is a \n\n## message that we at the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) have \n\n## heard loud and clear, especially when it comes to kids and \n\n## technology. \"Don't let your child watch television. Don't give your \n\n## baby an iPhone.\" Parents respond, \"I'd love to listen to you, but I'm \n\n## busy right now funding my 401-K.

Will \n\n## handing your toddler an iPhone while you pay for groceries permanently stunt her development? Probably not, but be \n\n## aware that new research further reinforces the relationship between media use in young children and delayed \n\n## learning of language skills. It's not like it happens instantly, but if you find that you can't go to the grocery store \n\n## without handing her a phone, it's time to reconsider. \n\n## Likewise, if you're going to acquire a new device for one of your children — be it a smartphone, a tablet, or a gaming \n\n## system — ask yourself ahead of time what the purpose of this device is and what rules you want to establish around its","metadata":{"id":805}}],["806",{"pageContent":"## system — ask yourself ahead of time what the purpose of this device is and what rules you want to establish around its \n\n## use. The AAP suggests, for example, that devices not come to the dinner table or stay in kids' bedrooms overnight. \n\n## Kids do need conversation around the dinner table, and they do need a solid night's sleep to be at their best. An easy \n\n## way to structure this conversation is to use the AAP's Family Media Use Plan tool (/English/media/Pages/default.aspx). \n\n## As your kids grow older their needs change, as do your family's. A laptop that may have previously been used \n\n## primarily for Minecraft becomes a mandatory tool for completing homework assignments. A social network that was \n\n## mainly for posting funny pictures becomes the main tool for planning nights out and keeping track of who said what \n\n## to whom during the school day. \n\n## At this point do take time to ask what's happening online. For our kids, the online world and the \"real\" world are all the \n\n## same thing. Even an activity as pointless-seeming as a video game often brings our kids together with their school \n\n## friends to form online teams, where the dynamics of the lunchroom and the playground continue to play out on a \n\n## strategic map running on a server farm somewhere in the desert. \n\n## So do ask questions. Do feel empowered to structure rules around media use, just as you would about food, safety, and \n\n## sleep. And do occasionally play with your food.

As parents, you do your best to feed your family healthy foods (/English/agesstages/gradeschool/nutrition/Pages/Making-Healthy-Food-Choices.aspx), but you may need help with choosing good sources of fiber. \n\n## How Much Fiber Do Children Need? \n\n There are different fiber recommendations for children based on energy needs, age, or weight. \n\n Eat 5. A simple way to make sure your children are getting enough fiber is by making healthful food choices. If your children are eating at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables each day along with other foods that are good sources of fiber, there is really no need to count fiber grams. Add 5. If you find it helpful to keep track of numbers, add 5 to your children’s age. For example, a 5-year-old would need about 10 grams of fiber each day. Note: The total daily recommended amount of up to 25 grams for adults can be used as a general guideline for children. \n\n## Why is Fiber Important? \n\n Fiber helps make us full and keeps things moving in the digestive tract. A diet that includes good sources of fiber may help prevent constipation (/English/health-issues/conditions/abdominal/Pages/Constipation.aspx). These foods also are good sources of nutrients and vitamins (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Where-We-StandVitamins.aspx)that may help reduce the risk of heart disease (/English/health-issues/conditions/heart/Pages/HeartDisease.aspx), certain types of cancer (/English/health-issues/conditions/cancer/Pages/default.aspx), and obesity (/English/health-issues/conditions/obesity/Pages/default.aspx). \n\n## Good sources of fiber include: \n\n Vegetables Fruit Beans Peas Nuts Fiber-rich whole-grain breads and cereals","metadata":{"id":815}}],["816",{"pageContent":"## Good sources of fiber include: \n\n Vegetables Fruit Beans Peas Nuts Fiber-rich whole-grain breads and cereals \n\n## How Do You Read Nutrition Facts? \n\n Nutrition Facts can tell you all about the nutrients and ingredients in a food. Nutrition Facts can help you choose foods that provide the nutrition that’s right for you, including fiber. Dietary fiber is a nutrient listed under “Total Carbohydrate” on the Nutrition Facts. \n\n Excellent sources of fiber have 5 or more grams of fiber per serving.

Grains vary widely in their fiber content. For example, whole-grain wheat has more fiber than whole-grain brown rice or wholegrain oats. The amount of fiber in a whole-grain food can vary by brand.

At about four months, she’ll start to babble, using many of the rhythms and characteristics of her \n\n## native language. Although it may sound like gibberish, if you listen closely, you’ll hear her raise and drop her voice as \n\n## if she were making a statement or asking a question. Encourage her by talking to her throughout the day. When she \n\n## says a recognizable syllable, repeat it back to her and then say some simple words that contain that sound.

Simply going \n\n## through the motions by regularly brushing and \n\n## cleaning gums still serves a very useful purpose. \n\n## Brush often. While we focus a lot on bedtime \n\n## (/English/healthy-living/oral-health/Pages/Brush\n\n## Book-Bed.aspx) brushing, technically speaking, your goal of brushing teeth is to clean food off of them, and the \n\n## sooner the better. Yet few adults we know make a regular habit of brushing their teeth throughout the day. Start \n\n## having your child brush after meals early in life and you stand a fighting chance of creating a lasting habit. \n\n## Sing, sing a song. Or set a timer. Or come up with some other creative way to keep your child engaged in the act \n\n## of brushing her teeth for the recommended 2 minutes, or for at least as long as it takes to make sure that your \n\n## combined efforts leave them clean. Some toothbrushes even light up or play music for the amount of time a \n\n## child should keep brushing, preventing kids from being fooled into thinking that they've brushed long enough. \n\n## Check it out. If your child is showing signs of independence and insists on brushing on their own, then by all \n\n## means let her. Just don't forget to get in the habit of proudly \"checking out\" their work at the end of each session \n\n## while casually doing some touch-ups of your own. \n\n## Appeal to taste.

Visit your child's health care provider. \n\n## All mothers share the concern about their milk being enough for their baby. If you are worried about breast milk \n\n## supply, visit your child's pediatrician—we are happy to help! Your pediatrician will start by looking at how your infant \n\n## is growing. A baby who is tracking along their growth curve (/English/health-issues/conditions/Glands-Growth\n\n## Disorders/Pages/Growth-Charts-By-the-Numbers.aspx) as they should is very reassuring. \n\n## Sometimes babies are fussy due to colic (/English/ages-stages/baby/crying-colic/Pages/Colic.aspx) or other factors, \n\n## which may not be related to the volume or amount of feeding. Pediatricians can also work with you to identify factors \n\n## that can help increase your breast milk supply or resolve breastfeeding difficulties, including latching issues \n\n## (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/ensuring-proper-latch-on.aspx) and breastfeeding positions \n\n## (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Positioning-Your-Baby-For-Breastfeeding.aspx).

An evaluation by a \n\n## board-certified lactation consultant can also help you discover any other possible causes of low breast milk supply. \n\n## In addition, your pediatrician may also be able to connect you with resources if you are struggling to find baby \n\n## formula (/English/tips-tools/ask-the-pediatrician/Pages/Are-there-shortages-of-infant-formula-due-to-COVID\n\n## 19.aspx) for your infant. \n\n## 2. Tech check your breast pump. \n\n## Effective milk extraction is the best way to help keep up your milk supply. If you are pumping and notice that there is a \n\n## decrease in the volume you are able to produce, check your pump equipment (/English/ages\n\n## stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/How-to-Clean-Your-Breast-Pump.aspx). Ensuring a proper flange fit can optimize \n\n## pumping. It is also a good idea to inspect the pump valves. Over time, they can become worn and reduce the \n\n## effectiveness of your pump. \n\n## For information about pump settings, you can look to your pump's manufacturer. Some even have help lines you can \n\n## call to troubleshoot pump-setting issues. However, it is best to seek the help of a lactation consultant to determine \n\n## which pump settings work best for you. \n\n## Also, consider if the type of pump you're using is best for your specific needs. A double electric pump is best when \n\n## needing to express breastmilk. Manual or hand pumps can work for short-term use, but are not ideal when you are \n\n## planning to return to work (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Returning-to-Work.aspx) outside the \n\n## home or pump longer term.

Falls are the \n\n#### most common injury associated with cribs, even though they are the easiest to prevent.

Do not use a crib if any parts are missing or broken. \n\n### You can prevent other crib hazards by observing the following guidelines: \n\n#### The mattress should be the same size as the crib so there are no gaps to trap arms, body, or legs. If you can insert \n\n#### more than two fingers between the mattress and the sides or ends of the crib, the crib and mattress combination \n\n#### should not be used. \n\n#### If you purchase a new mattress, remove and destroy all plastic wrapping material that comes with it, because it \n\n#### can suffocate a child. \n\n#### Before your baby can sit, lower the mattress of the crib to the level where he cannot fall out either by leaning \n\n#### against the side or by pulling himself over it. Set the mattress at its lowest position before your child learns to \n\n#### stand. The most common falls occur when a baby tries to climb out, so move your child to another bed when he is \n\n#### 35 inches (89 cm) tall, or when the height of the side rail is less than three-quarters of his height (approximately \n\n#### nipple level). \n\n#### Periodically check the crib to be sure there are no rough edges or sharp points on the metal parts, and no \n\n#### splinters or cracks in the wood.","metadata":{"id":848}}],["849",{"pageContent":"#### nipple level). \n\n#### Periodically check the crib to be sure there are no rough edges or sharp points on the metal parts, and no \n\n#### splinters or cracks in the wood. \n\n#### Do not use bumper pads in cribs.

In \n\n#### addition, toddlers can use a bumper guard to help them climb and fall out. \n\n#### Pillows, quilts, comforters, sheepskins, stuffed animals, and other soft products should not be placed in a crib. \n\n#### Babies have suffocated on such items in the crib. \n\n#### If you hang a mobile over your child's crib, be sure it is securely attached to the side rails, wall or ceiling.

Along with \n\n## weighing your child’s needs, there are three main types of child care to think about. There is no \n\n## simple formula for choosing the right child care provider for your child. However, learning as \n\n## much as you can about your options can help you decide what is best for your family. \n\n## What Type for Your Child? \n\n## There are three basic types of child care: \n\n## In-home care: A caregiver comes into your home and supervises your child there. \n\n## Family child care: Child caregivers provide their service out of their own homes. \n\n## Center-based care: Child care organizations feature structured activities and programs, as well as a trained staff. \n\n## Choosing the right option for your family comes down to thinking about the pros and cons of each type. \n\n## In-Home Care \n\n## For some families, the most convenient option is having the caregiver come to your own home. In some cases, \n\n## caregivers may even live in the family home. The advantages to this approach include the potential for your child to \n\n## receive more individual attention, limited exposure to seasonal ailments such as colds and the flu, and your child’s \n\n## comfort level with a familiar place. \n\n## There are challenges to having an inhome caregiver, however. For starters, skilled in-home providers are not easy to \n\n## find. If you do find one, realize that both the caregiver and child need clear rules about what your expectations are. \n\n## These rules should include how to discipline the child in your absence; how much TV time (if any) is OK; what \n\n## activities you want your child to take part in (reading, playtime, etc.); and when it’s OK to take your child on an outing. \n\n## An in-home caregiver should be willing to provide a complete daily schedule and report of your child’s activities, and","metadata":{"id":854}}],["855",{"pageContent":"## An in-home caregiver should be willing to provide a complete daily schedule and report of your child’s activities, and \n\n## to make use of positive, effective methods of discipline. Even so, it’s not easy to know for sure what your child’s \n\n## caregiver is doing when you’re not there. That’s why frequent, unannounced visits from friends or family members \n\n## are a good idea. \n\n## Keep in mind that you’ll need to have a backup plan in place for those times when your child’s caregiver is sick, needs \n\n## personal time, or is on vacation. \n\n## Family Child Care \n\n## Some child care providers work out of their own homes, often supervising other children alongside their own. These \n\n## family child care providers are usually not as convenient for parents as in-home care. But they can sometimes provide \n\n## a more focused, home-like environment than center-based care and are usually easier to find than in-home \n\n## caregivers. \n\n## If you are thinking about a family child care situation, there are some questions you will want to ask: \n\n## What are the caregiver’s policies and qualifications? Is he or she licensed or registered with the state, or \n\n## accredited by a recognized child care organization? \n\n## What kind of program does the caregiver provide, and what condition is the caregiver’s home in? \n\n## Are there other children, teens, or adults in the home besides the caregiver?

If your caregiver is sick or unavailable, or in case of emergencies, you’ll need a fallback option \n\n### since usually only one adult is providing the care.

Some are independently owned, while others are sponsored by churches, \n\n### employers, schools, or government agencies or programs, such as Head Start. Whether it’s called a child care center, \n\n### preschool, nursery school, learning center, or something similar, it serves the same basic function: providing care for \n\n### children at a central location. \n\n### Regardless of who sponsors it or what it is called, a child care center should be licensed and inspected on a regular \n\n### basis for health, safety, cleanliness, staffing, and program content.

This organization can provide helpful information and contacts to steer you \n\n### toward locally available child care in your community. \n\n### Get a list of child care providers in your community, then call them and ask for information about who they are and \n\n### what they offer.

Include them if you can by talking about how you used to breastfeed them (if you did), giving \n\n## them a little hug with your free arm, telling them a story, or watching while they draw you a picture, work in a \n\n## workbook, or play with a toy. \n\n## Some mothers find that nursing sessions are wonderful times to listen to music or children’s stories with their babies’ \n\n## siblings.

Therefore, you should offer the breast to your infant first, and nurse your older \n\n## child only after your infant has had her fill. Also watch your own nutrition and energy levels more closely.

They're \n\n## also developing better balance in their trunk, head, and \n\n## neck. \n\n## First, they'll raise their head and hold it up while lying \n\n## on their stomach. Encourage this by placing them on \n\n## their stomach and extending their arms forward while they are awake.

This also is a good way to check their hearing and vision. \n\n## Getting ready to roll over \n\n## Once they're able to lift their head, your baby will start pushing up on their arms and arching their back to lift their \n\n## chest. This strengthens their upper body. This is key to keeping steady and upright when sitting. At the same time, \n\n## your baby may rock on their stomach, kick their legs, and “swim\" with their arms.

These movement milestones are often \n\n## called \"motor development \n\n## (/English/MotorDelay/Pages/default.aspx);\" they are a \n\n## source of delight for babies and their families. \n\n## Here's an overview of some \n\n## typical motor milestones to \n\n## expect from birth to 3 months: \n\n## Month one \n\n## Your baby will not be able to control many of her movements during the first few weeks. As she begins to develop \n\n## more physical abilities, her motions may still be jerky or jittery. But she's learning fast, so hold on! \n\n## Eyes on you. Did you know one of the first parts of the body a baby can move are her eyes? Newborns can only \n\n## see about a foot in front of them at first, but that's just enough to move their eyes to gaze at faces near them.

Here's what else you \n\n## can expect: \n\n## Heads up on tummy time. Most babies this age can lift their head up when lying on their tummies. Regularly \n\n## giving your baby some \"tummy time (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/The-Importance-of-Tummy\n\n## Time.aspx)\" is a great way to help her build strength in her neck and trunk. Some will cry when placed on their \n\n## tummies, but usually do better after a few tries. It helps to have something interesting, such as mom's face, in \n\n## front of them so they have encouragement to lift their head. Although too young to actually crawl, your baby may \n\n## try or begin to push up from a lying position. \n\n## Hand to mouth. During these weeks, your baby may begin to wave his arms around more when excited. \n\n## Increasingly, his hands will catch his attention.

He'll \n\n#### also enjoy more actively kicking his legs, which are straightening out from their pulled-up newborn position. \n\n#### Ready to roll. As her kicks continue to become more forceful, she may soon be able to kick herself over from her \n\n#### tummy to back. While most babies can't roll from back to tummy yet, some may begin rolling over at this age. Be \n\n#### careful never to leave your baby alone on furniture where they could roll over. \n\n#### Get a grip. Babies this age may begin to swipe at objects hanging just out of reach. While a newborn reflex \n\n#### causes babies to wrap their fingers around objects that touch the palm, your baby's grasp may now be more \n\n#### deliberate. She may even be able to hold and shake hand toys. \n\n#### Let's bounce. When held up and supported in a \"standing\" position on a surface such as your lap, your baby may \n\n#### discover the joy of bouncing.

Many online games let players set up their own private link that they can send to their \n\n#### friends. \n\n## Stay involved \n\n#### Engaging with your child and keeping communication open is one of the most important ways you can help them stay \n\n#### safe. \n\n#### Ask your child to tell you about the games they like and why. Play it with them (ask them to teach you how—they \n\n#### enjoy that) or watch them play. \n\n#### Make it a point to check in often about who your child is gaming with and if they've had any strangers contact \n\n#### them. \n\n#### Keep the device or computer your child is using in a room with plenty of traffic, such as the living room, family \n\n#### room, or kitchen. This lets you see what they're doing without hovering over them. \n\n#### Check out any MMOs your child wants to play beforehand. Make yourself aware of the content and use parental \n\n#### controls to guide your child's play. \n\n## Set time limits on gaming \n\n#### As with any type of screen, it's important to give your child limits on gaming. They need to have time for other \n\n#### activities such as homework, chores and being active (/English/healthy-living/fitness/StopWatch\n\n#### Tool/Pages/default.aspx).

Also, as odd as it may sound, some parents bite their child’s nails as a way of trimming them, which \n\n## they should avoid doing to prevent the risk of a condition called herpetic whitlow (a finger or thumb infection caused \n\n## by the herpes simplex virus). \n\n## By contrast, your baby’s toenails grow much more slowly and are usually very soft and pliable. They needn’t be kept as \n\n## short as the fingernails, so you may have to trim them only once or twice a month.

Well, neither did we until we \n\n## looked it up, but it certainly doesn't surprise us. While \n\n## that may not seem like much on the surface, let us \n\n## assure you that your newborn's nails will keep you busy. \n\n## Keeping up with them as they continuously grow can \n\n## be a very demanding task. \n\n## As far as we're concerned, the real purpose baby nails \n\n## serve is to break you into parenthood. They will likely \n\n## require trimming or filing at least once a week, because long nails on the hands of newborns with little to no control of \n\n## them predictably result in stray scratches. If you happen to fall behind on your nail clipping, your baby will inevitably \n\n## remind you (and make you feel guilty) by scratching his face when his nails get too long (or if you leave sharp corners \n\n## or points when clipping). \n\n## Baby mittens: handy, up to a point \n\n## Many parents cover their newborn's hands with baby mittens or socks to prevent wayward nails from scratching their \n\n## faces. As your baby develops over the next several weeks (and you become more skilled at nail clipping), though, it's a \n\n## good idea to allow babies plenty of time during which they can freely explore with their hands. If scratches continue to \n\n## be a problem, we suggest limiting covered time to when your baby is sleeping. \n\n## The baby mani-pedi \n\n## A handful of parents are intimidated by the prospect of having to cut their baby's nails and would probably opt for a \n\n## professional manicure-pedicure if only it was generally available.

And while we aren't exactly recommending it (or admitting to doing it ourselves), we're well aware that \n\n## some parents opt to bite or peel off their newborn's nails rather than fiddle with clippers or scissors.

The goal is for \n\n## all babies to have a newborn hearing screening by one month of age, ideally before they go home from the hospital; \n\n## identified by 3 months of age and enrolled in early intervention or treatment, if identified as deaf or hard of hearing, \n\n## by the age of 6 months. \n\n## Why do newborns need hearing screening? \n\n## The hearing screening is a first and important step in helping understand if your baby may be deaf or hard of hearing. \n\n## Without newborn hearing screening, it is hard to know when there are hearing changes in the first months and years \n\n## of your baby's life. \n\n## Babies may respond to noise by startling or turning their heads toward the sound, for example.

A tiny probe is placed just \n\n## inside the baby's ear canal. It measures the response (echo) \n\n## when clicks or tones are played into the baby's ears. \n\n\n#### Both screens are quick (about 5 to 10 minutes), painless, and may be \n\n#### done while your baby is sleeping or lying still.

Pulse oximetry screening is done after 24 \n\n#### hours after birth to allow the baby's heart and lungs to fully adjust to life outside his or her \n\n#### mother. After the screening is completed, the doctor or nurse will go over the reading with \n\n#### the baby's parents. \n\n## What happens a baby fails the pulse oximetry screening? \n\n#### If the screening test suggests a problem, additional testing to evaluate for CHD or for other potential causes of low \n\n#### oxygen will be necessary before the baby will be discharged from the hospital. \n\n#### Testing may include a chest radiography and bloodwork. A thorough ultrasound of the baby's heart called an \n\n#### echocardiogram will be performed and read by a pediatric cardiologist. The echo will evaluate all the structures and \n\n#### function of the baby's heart in detail. If the baby's echo shows any problems, the baby's medical team will discuss next \n\n### steps with the parents in detail. See Common Types of Cardiac Testing (/English/health\n\n### issues/conditions/heart/Pages/Common-Types-of-Cardiac-Testing.aspx) for more information. \n\n#### Note: As with any screening test, sometimes there can be times when the pulse oximetry screening test is not correct.","metadata":{"id":925}}],["926",{"pageContent":"#### Note: As with any screening test, sometimes there can be times when the pulse oximetry screening test is not correct. \n\n#### Sometimes there can be false positives, meaning that while the pulse ox screen suggests a problem, the echo will be \n\n#### reassuring that the heart is normal. Just because a baby fails the pulse oximetry screening test does not mean that \n\n#### the baby has a heart defect. There are other reasons that a baby may have lower oxygen levels, such as infection or \n\n#### lung problems. These are also very helpful to be picked up early.

This means it is involuntary or happens \n\n## without your baby trying. If you put your finger in their \n\n## mouth, they suck reflexively.

Here are some you can watch \n\n## for in your baby: \n\n## Rooting \n\n## In some cases, reflexes change into voluntary behavior. \n\n## For example, your baby is born with a rooting reflex that prompts him to turn his head toward your hand if you stroke \n\n## his cheek or mouth. This helps him find the nipple at feeding time. At first, he'll root from side to side, turning his head \n\n## toward the nipple and then away in decreasing arcs. He'll simply move his head and mouth into position to suck. \n\n## Sucking \n\n## Sucking is another survival reflex present even before birth. In fact, if you had an ultrasound during pregnancy, you \n\n## may have seen your baby sucking their thumb. \n\n## After birth, when a nipple and areola are placed deeply in your baby's mouth, he automatically begins to suck. This \n\n## motion actually has two stages. First, he places his lips around the areola with the nipple far back in the mouth, \n\n## pointed to the junction of the hard and soft palate, and compresses the breast between his tongue and palate (called \n\n## \"expression,\" this action forces the milk out). In the second phase, or milking action, the tongue moves from the areola \n\n## to the nipple. This whole process is helped by the suction that secures the breast to the baby's mouth. \n\n## Coordinating these rhythmic sucking movements with breathing and swallowing is a relatively complicated task for a","metadata":{"id":928}}],["929",{"pageContent":"## Coordinating these rhythmic sucking movements with breathing and swallowing is a relatively complicated task for a \n\n## newborn.

Most often \n\n## there is no cause for greatconcern, but it’s important to be sensitive to your body’s signals. \n\n## After the first few months of pregnancy, your milk supply will probably diminish somewhat, and the taste of your \n\n## breast milk may change as well. Either of these changes may cause your baby to refuse the breast milk and eventually \n\n## wean himself. You may initiate weaning yourself if you experience too much nipple tenderness or physical \n\n## discomfort. If you and your older baby do continue breastfeeding, it is important to keep in mind that pregnancy and \n\n## breast milk production both require extra energy. Be sure to monitor your food intake as you prepare for childbirth \n\n## and get plenty of rest. \n\n## Breastfeeding both your older child and your infant, called tandem nursing, can in some cases ease your older child’s \n\n## adjustment to the new baby, address your own desire to maintain closeness with the older child, and even make child \n\n## care easier in some cases as both children are fed and comforted on the breast.

This helps to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). If \n\n## you are breastfeeding, wait until breastfeeding is going well before offering a pacifier.

This is very dangerous and could \n\n## cause serious injury or even death. \n\n## Be prepared for night waking.

Your child is more independent than before, better able to care for herself, and more capable of contributing to chores and other household responsibilities. Most families discover that routines can be established, and in many ways life seems more settled. However, youngsters still need parental supervision and guidance. During the middle childhood years, parents have two tasks that are especially important. The first is learning to allow and encourage your child to enter the new world of school and friends alone. The second is learning to be parents at a distance. Once children enter school, parents spend less than half as much time with them as they did before. Parents thus need to be more efficient, more vigilant, and still very much involved in their children's lives in order to monitor, guide, and support them effectively. During the school years your youngster may develop more self-confidence, overcome fears and self-doubts, test the limits of her autonomy, find role models, and learn and internalize moral and spiritual values. You and the rest of the family should pay particular attention to the following areas, which will become increasingly significant during this time of life: \n\n## School","metadata":{"id":972}}],["973",{"pageContent":"## School \n\n School assumes a central role in your youngster's life when she reaches the age of five or six, drawing much of her attention and energy away from the family unit. Her elementary-school years can become a time of enormous satisfaction and excitement. As she learns to read and master other academic skills, she will develop a love of learning and a pride in her achievements. This can contribute to her self-esteem, not only because of her accomplishments in the classroom but also as she separates successfully from the home environment. In the process her teacher can become a source of support and an important role model in her life. For some children, however, school may cause frustration and stress. Learning disabilities can interfere with the joy of learning. Poor study habits and/or a lack of motivation can create academic difficulties. Sometimes youngsters may have a poor relationship with their teachers, or they may experience separation anxiety that can interfere with their school attendance. To make your own child's education as positive and productive as possible, closely monitor her academic progress and social adjustment, and get to know her teacher. Discuss with your child what she is learning in the classroom and how she feels about school. Encourage her to demonstrate her newly learned skills and to practice them with you. Supervise your child's homework (but don't do it for her), and make sure she is preparing herself well for tests. Limit the amount of television she watches and encourage her to read, write, and express herself creatively through hobbies and sports. If she (or her teacher) reports any problem areas, communicate openly with school personnel, and try to figure out how best to help your youngster overcome her difficulties. Consult your pediatrician for suggestions to help solve these problems. \n\n## Friendships","metadata":{"id":973}}],["974",{"pageContent":"## Friendships \n\n As important as your child's family is to her, friends and acquaintances will become increasingly significant during middle childhood. She will spend more time with her peers, both in and out of school. These playmates will provide companionship, and your youngster will probably become preoccupied with being socially accepted by her friends. She will feel a strong need for both conformity (to be just like the others) and recognition (to be seen as unique). Your family will also have to deal with the stresses associated with your child's peer relationships. From time to time she may have conflicts with friends, which can undermine her self-esteem. Maybe she will be excluded from a circle that she really wants to be a part of, leading to unhappiness and loneliness. During these years, monitor your child's choice of friends and supervise, but do not interfere with, her play activities. Get to know her friends' parents and share with them your observations about the children's activities. Offer support, understanding, and guidance to your child when problems arise in her peer relationships. When a conflict occurs, try to understand how your child feels about it, and what she sees as the factors contributing to it.

At the same time keep in mind that the family cannot solve every peer-related difficulty—for example, you cannot run to the playground and intervene whenever a conflict arises. Even so, you can offer support and guidance, conveying your own values and expectations. \n\n## Outside Activities","metadata":{"id":974}}],["975",{"pageContent":"## Outside Activities \n\n During middle childhood your youngster will develop a number of outside interests, from sports to Scouting, from music lessons to clubs. Many of these activities will require a commitment on the family's part, in terms of time and, in some cases, money. It may also require parental patience and tolerance as children experiment with different programs before finding the ones they prefer. In general, the family—most particularly the parents—should be willing to support the child with resources, encouragement, supervision, chauffeuring, and, at times, direct participation.

Share a Common Focus: Read a book together (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Developmental-Milestones\n\n## of-Early-Literacy.aspx), share a toy, look at the same dog in a park. When two people focus on the same thing at \n\n## the same time, they are engaging in what is called \"joint attention.\" Joint attention is a vital part of \n\n## communication and language development (/English/ages-stages/toddler/Pages/Language-Development-2\n\n## Year-Olds.aspx). It is also an important social skill, allowing a child to share an experience with another person \n\n## and see someone else's point of view.

Send and Receive Nonverbal Messages: Speaking and understanding words are just part of the \n\n## communication puzzle. Non-verbal signals such as eye contact, facial expressions, gestures, and body language \n\n## provide additional information. A child is able to recognize emotions and understand the intent of a message. \n\n## When a parent is using a smartphone, these nonverbal cues are often reduced or eliminated completely. As a \n\n## result, children miss out on receiving important nonverbal signals from their parents (part of learning to \n\n## communicate).

This way, if a spill occurs, you’ll \n\n### know if any are missing. \n\n### When giving your child medicine, lean over a counter or table. This helps contain any accidental spills. \n\n### Any medication can be dangerous, so treat all products with the same respect. We worry about opioids, but some \n\n### blood pressure and diabetes medications can be fatal to a toddler who swallows only one pill. \n\n### If a medication spills, vacuum or sweep the area as an extra precaution to ensure nothing is missed. \n\n### Dispose of unused medications—especially opioids (/English/ages-stages/teen/substance-abuse/Pages/The\n\n### Opioid-Epidemic.aspx)—at pharmacies, drug \"take back\" programs or doctors’ offices \n\n### Know basic first aid (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/First-Aid-Guide.aspx) and keep the Poison \n\n### Center Number (1-800-222-1222) stored in your phone. \n\n### Get into the practice of safe medication storage, starting as soon as your baby is born. \n\n## That terrible morning \n\n### I’ve known the Gillan family for years.

Inverted nipples retract inward toward the breast instead of protruding \n\n## out when the areola is gently squeezed. Flat nipples neither retract nor protrude but remain \n\n## more or less flat. When not compressed, some inverted nipples appear normal. Others contain a \n\n## small dimple or may have a clear indentation at all times. You can test your own nipples by gently \n\n## compressing the areola about one to two inches behind the nipple. If your nipples draw inward or \n\n## remain flat, tell your obstetrician and pediatrician. \n\n## Inverted nipples, and to a lesser extent flat nipples, can create a problem during breastfeeding by making it more \n\n## difficult for the baby to properly latch on to the breast.

Fortunately, a woman with inverted or flat nipples can \n\n## still breastfeed if her nipples can protrude outward with stimulation. In addition, inverted and flat nipples sometimes \n\n## become sufficiently everted, or normally protruding, on their own during pregnancy, so that by the time the baby is \n\n## born, breastfeeding can proceed without problems. Even if the nipples don’t evert on their own, this characteristic \n\n## should not prevent most women from successfully breastfeeding their children. \n\n## Some methods used in the past to correct inverted nipples during pregnancy may actually reduce breastfeeding","metadata":{"id":1020}}],["1021",{"pageContent":"## should not prevent most women from successfully breastfeeding their children. \n\n## Some methods used in the past to correct inverted nipples during pregnancy may actually reduce breastfeeding \n\n## success and are no longer routinely recommended.

First, \n\n#### they might be unable to observe family members and peers using the toilet, so they cannot mimic their behavior. So \n\n#### many details of toilet or potty use—where the potty is in the bathroom, how the body is oriented to it as one sits down, \n\n#### how the urine and poop get into the potty, how one tears off and uses toilet paper—are simple to understand if a child \n\n#### can observe the process but difficult if they cannot. Without sight to help them, your child will need to rely more on \n\n#### language to understand how the process works. Because of this, you will probably want to wait a little longer to begin \n\n#### potty training—until they are three or four years old (or even later, since language delays (/English/ages\n\n#### stages/toddler/Pages/Language-Delay.aspx) can accompany blindness)—so that they can fully comprehend what you \n\n#### are telling her. \n\n#### When you are ready to introduce your child with a visual impairment to the concept of toilet use, start bringing them \n\n#### with you when you use the bathroom. Allow them to explore the bathroom and locate the toilet. (Be sure it’s well \n\n#### ventilated and smells pleasant so they will want to return.)

Place their hands on your shoulders so they can feel you \n\n#### sitting on the toilet, explain what you are doing and why, and guide her hands to the toilet paper dispenser. Also show \n\n#### them the flush handle and the sink for hand washing. \n\n#### Once you have placed a potty in the bathroom, lead them to it, let them accustom herself to its presence, and keep it in \n\n#### the same place throughout the toilet-training process. Talk to them about toilet use at other times, too—pointing out \n\n#### that most of the people they knows use the toilet and that toilet use is a sign of being a big kid who can take care of \n\n#### themselves. \n\n#### Once your child begins practicing potty use themselves, keep the bathroom and the passage to it clear of obstacles. A \n\n#### musical potty that is activated when urine hits the bowl might make the learning process more fun. Teach them to feel \n\n#### the inner edge of the seat before tossing in the toilet paper and, if the child is a boy urinating standing up at a toilet, to \n\n#### position his body so he doesn’t urinate on the toilet itself. (You may want to have your son first sit to urinate; once he \n\n#### masters that skill, then you can teach him to stand in front of the toilet.) \n\n#### Finally, as your child grows more comfortable with bathroom use, make a point of taking them to the bathroom at \n\n#### each public place you visit. By helping them familiarize themselves with the wide variety of bathroom layouts and \n\n#### toilet styles, you will help build their self-confidence when away from home and prevent accidents. And don’t forget to \n\n#### reward their progress with praise, hugs or a small reward. \n\n## Hearing disabilities \n\n#### Children who are deaf or have difficulty hearing (/English/health-issues/conditions/developmental\n\n#### disabilities/Pages/Hearing-Loss.aspx)may or may not find toilet training challenging, depending on their ability to","metadata":{"id":1032}}],["1033",{"pageContent":"#### disabilities/Pages/Hearing-Loss.aspx)may or may not find toilet training challenging, depending on their ability to \n\n#### communicate. A child who is already fluent in sign language (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/These-Hands-Were\n\n#### Made-for-Talking.aspx) can rely on a combination of visual observation and explanations from you to understand \n\n#### what’s expected of them—much like any other child. Children who do not yet have the ability to understand your \n\n#### signals and simple signs may not be ready for toilet training until they are somewhat older. \n\n#### The key to training in these cases is to keep the process simple. When introducing the concept, emphasize the visual: \n\n#### Allow your child to observe you (and, even better, other children) using the bathroom, and show them picture books \n\n### about it. Choose one gesture or sign for the essential terms (pee, poop, potty, wet, dry, and need to go). Use these \n\n#### gestures each time you use the bathroom, and use them with them as well—signing \"wet\" (with a sad face) when you \n\n#### change her diaper or wet underwear, \"dry\" (with a happy expression) once they've been changed, and \"need to go\" after \n\n#### lunch when it’s time to sit on the potty. \n\n#### As long as you are consistent and stick with the half-dozen signals you need, your child will get the hang of potty use \n\n#### without longer explanations.

By placing them on the potty \n\n#### frequently (reminding them every hour or so to visit the bathroom), you remove the burden of having to acknowledge \n\n#### so many times each day that they must interrupt an activity to tend to their physical needs. Going to the bathroom at \n\n#### the top of every hour can become a habit similar to brushing teeth twice a day or getting dressed in the morning— \n\n#### freeing her up to focus on other activities between visits. \n\n## Cerebral palsy \n\n#### Children with cerebral palsy (/English/health-issues/conditions/developmental-disabilities/Pages/Cerebral\n\n#### Palsy.aspx) not only tend to be slow in developing bladder control, but may not have enough bladder awareness to \n\n#### begin toilet training at age two or three. If your child has cerebral palsy, they will need help to develop an awareness \n\n#### they needs to go (which may be signaled to you when you see them clutching their genitals or fidgeting anxiously) \n\n#### before they can begin toilet training. They will have to be able to delay urination until they are in position on the potty. \n\n#### They will need to remove their clothing and then hold themselves on the potty (with supports) long enough to achieve \n\n#### success. Again, these challenges mean that it is usually best to wait to toilet-train until they are older. \n\n#### It is possible that limited physical activity, undeveloped muscle tone, or medications may cause constipation \n\n#### (/English/health-issues/conditions/abdominal/Pages/constipation.aspx) for your child with cerebral palsy. So, pay \n\n#### special attention to their diet as you start toilet-training. Make sure they are drinking plenty of fluids and eating foods \n\n#### high in fiber (/English/ages-stages/teen/nutrition/Pages/Fiber-An-Important-Part-of-Your-Teens-Diet.aspx) such as","metadata":{"id":1034}}],["1035",{"pageContent":"#### high in fiber (/English/ages-stages/teen/nutrition/Pages/Fiber-An-Important-Part-of-Your-Teens-Diet.aspx) such as \n\n#### fruits and vegetables. As they begin to practice removing her clothes before getting onto the potty, make it easier by \n\n#### providing clothes with Velcro fasteners or loose elastic waistbands. (They may find it easier to remove her clothes \n\n#### while lying down.) \n\n## Spina bifida and spinal cord injury \n\n#### Spina bifida (/English/health-issues/conditions/developmental-disabilities/Pages/Spina-Bifida.aspx), spinal cord \n\n#### injury, or spinal tumors create toilet-training problems for young children similar to those of cerebral palsy. But since \n\n#### most children with this condition never develop an awareness of when they need to go, few can ever fully use a toilet. \n\n#### You can, however, teach your child to remove urine through a catheter on a regular basis, and to visit the bathroom for \n\n#### bowel movements on a regular schedule. (A high-fiber diet with plenty of liquids and meals served on a regular \n\n#### schedule will make this process easier. Sometimes a stool softener or even a suppository or enema is needed.) Since \n\n#### your child will find it difficult to remove her clothing, be sure to provide them with Velcro fastened clothes and allow \n\n#### them to lie down to undress if necessary. \n\n#### A child with spinal cord dysfunctions will likely not feel the need to move their bowels and have a greater risk of being \n\n#### constipated.

Remember, their \n\n#### progress is especially significant if it increases their self-confidence and prepares them for more challenges. Give \n\n#### them all the information, attention and support they need to succeed. \n\n## Behavioral and mental disorders \n\n#### Your experience toilet-training a toddler who has been identified as having developmental or behavioral difficulties \n\n#### will depend a great deal on your particular child’s temperament, behavior patterns and coexisting conditions. Your \n\n#### knowledge of your child’s strengths, weaknesses, tendencies and interests will help the process. \n\n##### Back to Top \n\n\n#### Toilet training can be particularly trying for parents of children who have developmental disorders or behavioral \n\n#### difficulties. This includes those with autism (/English/health-issues/conditions/chronic/pages/Autism.aspx), fetal \n\n#### alcohol syndrome (FAS) (/English/ages-stages/prenatal/Pages/Fetal-Alcohol-Spectrum-Disorders.aspx), oppositional \n\n#### defiant disorder (ODD) (/English/health-issues/conditions/emotional-problems/Pages/Disruptive-Behavior","metadata":{"id":1036}}],["1037",{"pageContent":"#### defiant disorder (ODD) (/English/health-issues/conditions/emotional-problems/Pages/Disruptive-Behavior\n\n#### Disorders.aspx), and, in cases when it is diagnosed this early, attention deficit /hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) \n\n#### (/English/health-issues/conditions/adhd/Pages/default.aspx). Many children with these conditions may not be \n\n#### strongly motivated, or sufficiently equipped, to respond to the social reinforcements that work so well with other \n\n#### children (\"What a big boy!\"). For some, small tangible rewards such as a sticker or small toy can be effective. \n\n#### Many find it extremely difficult to adjust to any change in routine. Some are particularly sensitive to touch and other \n\n#### sensory input and become upset by the frequent pulling off and on of clothing, the physical closeness with an adult \n\n#### and the unfamiliar surroundings of the bathroom. \n\n#### For some children, simply learning the abstract concept of potty use can be complicated. For example, some children \n\n#### with behavioral disorders do not naturally imitate their parents’ or peers’ behavior. Others learn only through simple \n\n#### imitation or other concrete, nonverbal demonstrations. Such complications in the training process mean that early \n\n#### efforts can create a high level of frustration in your child and may lead to displays of temper, stubbornness, and refusal \n\n#### to cooperate. \n\n#### Despite challenges, most children with special needs—whether they have physical challenges or behavioral issues— \n\n#### can be toilet trained, though in some cases the process may take up to a year or even longer. They may require help \n\n#### from an occupational or physical therapist or a rehabilitation engineer. \n\n#### Your first step is to determine whether your child is ready to start training.

It is also important to have your child examined by their \n\n#### pediatrician, since they may be at a higher risk for constipation or loose stools, which may interfere with training. \n\n#### Once you have decided to begin, observe your child and consider carefully the specific traits, patterns of behavior, and \n\n#### obstacles that may impact their learning process. If they seems to dislike entering the bathroom, determine the cause \n\n#### of their discomfort. Is it the smell of disinfectant? The cold floor? The flushing toilet? Change or fix it if possible \n\n#### (change cleansers, put socks on their feet, move their potty away from the noisy toilet). \n\n#### If they do not overtly signal the need to go, do they pause just before voiding or otherwise behave in a way that will \n\n#### provide you with a cue? At what times, or how long after eating or drinking, does he usually pee or poop? What foods, \n\n#### toys or other objects are they most passionate about? These can be used as tangible potty-training rewards, which may \n\n#### prove more effective than praise. \n\n#### Identify how your child learns best. Some respond to firm but gentle physical demonstrations (being placed on the \n\n#### potty at regular times). Others do best with a formal routine containing a series of simple and predictable steps \n\n#### (verbally explained and reexplained, illustrated with pictures, or listed on a chart). Still others do best with offhand \n\n#### comments and conversations that inform without inviting resistance. \n\n## Intellectual Disabilities and Developmental Disorders \n\n#### Most children with a developmental delay (/English/news/Pages/Are-Pediatricians-Screening-for-Developmental\n\n#### Delays.aspx), an intellectual disability, or an autism spectrum disorder can be toilet-trained.

Like with other children, as you introduce your child to \n\n#### the concept of potty use, it often helps to keep explanations simple. Start by checking the state of their diaper or pants \n\n#### every hour or so and offering a one-word, nonjudgmental comment when they are wet (\"Wet!\"). After you change \n\n#### them, smile and say \"Dry!\" If their verbal skills are limited, you might substitute a special gesture or sign for the words \n\n### wet, dry, potty, need to go, and so on. \n\n#### Begin bringing them to the bathroom with you when you need to use it. Smile and say \"Dry!\" after you’ve finished and \n\n#### pulled your pants up. If at all possible, have your child observe other children using the bathroom, too.

After you’ve \n\n#### finished and are dressed, show them how happy you are and tell them \"Dry!\" If they have a favorite doll or stuffed \n\n#### animal, use it to play \"potty,\" demonstrating again how the potty is used. \n\n##### Back to Top \n\n\n#### When they are ready to begin using the potty, begin setting them on it at regular times—quite frequently at first (as \n\n#### frequently as you checked them for wetness earlier) and then gradually settling down to the times when they usually","metadata":{"id":1039}}],["1040",{"pageContent":"#### frequently as you checked them for wetness earlier) and then gradually settling down to the times when they usually \n\n#### go.

Once they do urinate into \n\n#### the potty, give him a big smile and say \"Pee!\" (or whatever word you have chosen for this event). Help them wipe off \n\n#### and then praise them with a happy \"Dry!\" and give them a reward. Eventually, with enough repetition, they will \n\n#### understand the connection. \n\n#### If your child has an intellectual disability or developmental delay, it is best to toilet train one step at a time. Don’t \n\n#### expect your child to learn to signal or announce their need to go, pull down their pants, use the potty, wipe their \n\n#### bottom and wash their hands all at once, the way their peers might.

(We would note that if and \n\n## when your baby is able to find his own fingers, it’s OK to let him continue using them as natural \n\n## pacifiers.) Others forewarn that pacifiers are simply a bad habit waiting to happen. Well fear not, \n\n## as long as you understand a few practical pacifier principles and pitfalls. In fact, pacifiers have, in \n\n## recent years, earned the status of a valuable ally in the fight against sudden infant death \n\n## syndrome. Whether you choose to breastfeed or bottle-feed, or a combination of both, here are \n\n## some tips for if and when you decide to give your baby a pacifier. \n\n## Soothing through sucking. Pacifiers can be invaluable in soothing babies as well as satisfying those who want to \n\n## suck all the time. You need not worry about your baby developing a lifelong dependency on them. Just be very \n\n## careful not to offer your newborn a pacifier at times when he really should be fed instead because pacifiers can \n\n## inappropriately pacify hungry babies as well as those who are looking for comfort. \n\n## Picking out the perfect pacifier. These days, picking the perfect pacifier may seem like a considerable task, \n\n## given all of the various brands and styles on the market. To the best of our knowledge, there’s no correlation \n\n## between price or marketing strategy and effectiveness, so we simply recommend trying one out and seeing if \n\n## your baby likes it. \n\n## If at first you don’t succeed. When you first offer your baby a pacifier, don’t be surprised if he seems","metadata":{"id":1048}}],["1049",{"pageContent":"## your baby likes it. \n\n## If at first you don’t succeed. When you first offer your baby a pacifier, don’t be surprised if he seems \n\n## uninterested, gets downright angry, or spits it out even when you know he’s not hungry and just wants comfort. \n\n## For breastfed babies, sucking on a pacifier inherently requires a different technique, and one that may take a few \n\n## tries. For breastfed and bottlefed babies alike, a nipple that does not provide milk may not be quickly welcomed. \n\n## As you offer your baby a pacifier, try lightly stroking just to the side of his mouth and then gently holding the \n\n## pacifier in his mouth for a moment as he starts sucking to keep it from popping right back out. \n\n## A practical pacifier substitute. The cheap, easy, and ever-present pacifier substitute: your pinky finger. If you \n\n## find yourself in the position of wanting to soothe your baby by giving him something to suck on other than your \n\n## breast, you can always use your (clean) little finger. Simply turn your hand palm-side up and let your baby suck \n\n## on your pinky finger, allowing it to rest gently in the roof of his mouth. As a word of caution for anyone with \n\n## longer fingernails than ours—you may want to rethink how much you value your long nails, or at least the one on \n\n## your little finger. You may find that it’s a small sacrifice to make to clip it shorter for the sake of having a \n\n## contented baby. Some babies will learn to find their own fingers to suck on earlier than others, so do your best to \n\n## make sure those fingers are clean (and have clipped nails too!) \n\n## Passing on pacifiers. If your baby just isn’t that much of a “sucker,” he may not need to be soothed by sucking \n\n## on a pacifier at all. Just be thankful that there’s one less thing to keep track of during the day, and just consider \n\n## offering one as he is falling asleep. \n\n## Author Laura A.

But the good news is that parents and child care providers can help slow the spread of the flu (/english/healthissues/conditions/flu/Pages/default.aspx) (influenza). \n\n Flu infections are highly contagious. The respiratory illness is caused by a virus. It spreads easily when children are in a group with other children such as in a child care center or family child care home. \n\n Flu is more dangerous than the common cold (/English/health-issues/conditions/flu/Pages/caringfor-Your-childs-cold-or-flu.aspx) for children. It can lead to serious health conditions like pneumonia or bacterial infections. Each year many children are hospitalized and some die from the flu. \n\n The following resources provide information on preventing the flu. Materials and tools for child care facilities also are included. \n\n## Flu vaccine \n\n The flu vaccine (/English/health-issues/conditions/flu/Pages/which-flu-vaccine-should-my-child-get-this-year.aspx) is the best way to protect against getting the flu. Everyone age 6 months and older need a flu vaccine each year. Babies cannot get their first flu shot until they are 6 months old (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/infantcare.htm#younger). \n\n It is critical that people who live with or care for children—especially newborns and infants younger than 6 months— get vaccinated. Immunizing adults and children who are around an infant to prevent illnesses is often referred to as \"cocooning.\" \n\n Which Flu Vaccine Should Children Get?

As adults, we know to wash our hands often with soap and water, especially after coughing, sneezing or wiping noses. When you cough or sneeze, cough into your sleeve or arm or into a tissue.

Unfortunately, she wasn't. \n\n##### Hundreds more have died this way since. \n\n##### The more I learned about tip-overs, the more angry and determined I became to \n\n##### stop them. Furniture is not required to be tested for safety, which was shocking \n\n##### to me.

Plastic can become brittle over \n\n##### time and break, causing anchors to fail. Counterfeit/knock off anchors are becoming a problem on some online \n\n##### sites. Use known brand name products, even if they are a little more expensive. \n\n##### The heavier the furniture, the more anchors you should use to prevent it from tipping. A resource list of \n\n##### recommended anchors can be found at here. (http://www.meghanshope.org/) \n\n##### In dressers and other clothing-storage furniture, place heavier objects on the lowest shelves/drawers and lighter \n\n##### objects in higher ones. \n\n##### Avoid putting items like toys, electronics, and remotes in high places, no matter where it is. This can tempt kids \n\n##### to climb. \n\n##### Install dresser drawer stops or safety straps so your child can't pull drawers out all the way. Use the kind that \n\n##### attach on the outside of the drawer and side of a dresser, or magnet locks. Remember to store the magnet key in a \n\n##### safe place out of sight and reach of the child. \n\n##### Never place a TV on top of a dresser, especially in a child's room or playroom. If you have an old tube style TV and \n\n##### replace it with a flat screen. Recycle it rather than give it away or put it elsewhere in your home. \n\n##### Mount flat-screen TVs to the wall or to furniture. Use anti-tip devices for TVs that aren't wall mounted.

Even if your \n\n## baby is unable to breastfeed at first, you can begin \n\n## expressing your milk immediately after giving birth. \n\n## When your baby is stable, you can have the milk fed to \n\n## them by a tube or by letting them sip the milk from a \n\n## tiny cup or bottle. \n\n## No matter how your breast milk is delivered to them, it \n\n## provides the best nourishment possible at a time when \n\n## it can make a big difference. \n\n## How premature breast milk meets your baby's special needs \n\n## Mothers of premature babies (/english/ages-stages/baby/preemie/Pages/default.aspx) produce breast milk that is \n\n## slightly different in composition, at least for the first several weeks. This difference is designed to meet your baby's \n\n## particular needs. Premature breast milk is higher in protein and minerals, such as salt, and contains different types of \n\n## fat that your baby can more easily digest and absorb. \n\n## The fat in human milk helps to enhance the development of a baby's brain and neurologic tissues, which is especially \n\n## important for premature infants.

Your hospital will provide you with a pump while you are there, and you can rent or purchase \n\n##### one to use at home later. \n\n##### The pump you use should create a milking action and not simply be a sucking device. Beginning as soon as possible \n\n##### after your baby's birth, express your milk at regular intervals, at approximately the times when your baby would \n\n##### usually feed. Aim to pump at least 6 to 8 times a day; this provides nipple stimulation and encourages milk production. \n\n##### You should pump at regular intervals throughout the night for the first few weeks, not going for more than 4 or 5 \n\n##### hours without pumping. If you wake up each morning and your breasts feel full, then you are sleeping too long \n\n##### through the night; this fullness will actually decrease your milk production. \n\n## Maintaining your breast milk supply \n\n##### For mothers of preterm babies, the minimum amount of time to try to pump throughout a twenty-four-hour period is \n\n##### one hundred minutes.

The massage should always be gentle to avoid \n\n##### producing friction on the skin surface or massaging so deeply that it causes pain. \n\n### What to know about colostrum \n\n##### Keep in mind that you will express only small amounts of colostrum at first, but this immune-boosting substance is \n\n##### extremely beneficial for your baby. Some mothers find that expressing the colostrum by hand massage into a small \n\n##### cup or spoon is easier than using an electric pump in the first few days. Hand expression into a cup also allows you to \n\n##### save each drop, instead of losing milk that is trapped within the tubing of the pump. \n\n##### Once your milk supply increases, the amount of milk you can express will probably fluctuate from day to day.

The feeding route will depend on the degree of prematurity of your infant and on the policies \n\n##### in the NICU at your hospital. \n\n##### Occasionally young infants fed by bottle may start to prefer the bottle, which delivers milk faster and with less effort \n\n#### than feeding at the breast. Some of these babies later refuse to breastfeed—a situation called nipple confusion or \n\n#### nipple preference. During this period when your baby is using an alternative feeding method, you can introduce them \n\n##### to breastfeeding by holding them skin to skin against your chest whenever possible and allowing them to nuzzle and \n\n##### suckle at your breast. This, of course, should be done only when the neonatologist or pediatrician has given approval. \n\n##### Soon you may be able to progress to a at-breast nursing supplementer or other device that will deliver your expressed \n\n##### breast milk from a bottle or syringe through a tiny tube that is taped next to your nipple. With this method, your baby \n\n##### should begin to feed partly from the tube and partly from your breast as they latch on to your breast and actively \n\n##### nurse. \n\n### Helping your baby latch on \n\n##### Early breastfeeding sessions will probably be more successful if you time them for when your baby is most awake and \n\n##### alert but calm.

Frequent nursing and milk expression, as well as regular skin-to-skin \n\n##### holding, will help maintain your milk supply. \n\n### Rooming in with your preemie \n\n##### An increasing number of hospitals allow mothers to room in, or stay overnight with their babies, on the night or two \n\n##### prior to discharge from the NICU.

This involuntary elimination process occurs because a baby’s digestive \n\n## system has not yet fully matured. \n\n## While urine fills the baby’s bladder and is released through the urethra, and bowel movements \n\n## fill the large intestine and are expelled via the rectum, just as with adults, babies cannot yet \n\n## control the circular sphincter muscles that keep the bladder and rectum closed. As a baby’s \n\n## stomach fills during a feeding and passes more fluid to the bladder, the sphincter muscles automatically relax, and \n\n## urination or a bowel movement occurs. \n\n## As long as this process remains involuntary, until at least eighteen months in most cases, a baby is unable to \n\n## consciously delay elimination. If placed on a potty at the right time, she will void into it, but she cannot deliberately \n\n## wait to use the potty and so cannot be fully toilet-trained. \n\n## Awareness of the Need to Go \n\n## At around her first birthday, your child will begin for the first time to recognize the sensation of a full rectum or \n\n## bladder, signaling a need to eliminate.

Jana, MD, FAAP & Jennifer Shu, MD, FAAP \n\n## We're willing to bet that this isn't the first time you've \n\n## been introduced to the benefits of raising a back\n\n## sleeping baby. Most new parents today are well \n\n## informed when it comes to SIDS and why back sleeping \n\n## is so strongly recommended. We'd be remiss, however, \n\n## if we didn't acknowledge the fact that you may find \n\n## yourself with some practical concerns when faced with \n\n## putting principle into practice. For the most part, the \n\n## following concerns cause parents to worry \n\n## unnecessarily: \n\n## Not sleeping \"well.\" One of the primary concerns (and observations) parents often have is that their babies don't \n\n## sleep as well on their backs. While it is true that back sleeping babies are likely to wake more frequently, what's \n\n## most important to understand is that their easier arousability is actually the reason why back sleeping is safer \n\n## than belly sleeping. While it is certainly understandable for new parents to dream of sleeping longer, you can \n\n## rest assured that this will come in good time. For now, just remind yourself that you don't want it to come at the \n\n## expense of your baby's safety. \n\n## Spit up & vomiting. The most common concern we hear is the understandable but unfounded fear that babies \n\n## will spit up and choke while on their backs. Fortunately, several reassuring studies, as well as the test of time, \n\n## have demonstrated that healthy babies put to sleep on their backs are able to turn their heads and/or protect \n\n## their airways if and when they spit up. And, while it may seem surprising, babies' anatomy actually makes \n\n## choking more likely when lying on their bellies. Finally, back sleeping babies are no more likely to have","metadata":{"id":1083}}],["1084",{"pageContent":"## choking more likely when lying on their bellies. Finally, back sleeping babies are no more likely to have \n\n## breathing or digestive-related problems than their belly-sleeping counterparts of years past. \n\n## Flat heads (sometimes referred to as positional skull deformities or positional plagiocephaly \n\n## (/English/health-issues/conditions/Cleft-Craniofacial/Pages/Positional-Skull-Deformities-and\n\n## Torticollis.aspx)). While there has been a documented increase in the number of babies \"walking\" with flat \n\n## heads since back sleeping came into vogue, the fact of the matter is that it really does not pose much of a \n\n## problem for most back-sleeping babies. In large part, that's because you have a good deal of control over the \n\n## situation. It's important to understand that the shape of a newborn's head is not set in stone and can be affected \n\n## by spending a lot of time in any given position. So, it is important to simply remember to try to alternate the \n\n## direction your baby faces each time they lie on their back—both while asleep and when awake. By offering your \n\n## newborn plenty of tummy time and time spent in positions other than flat on their back while they are awake, \n\n## you can also help decrease the likelihood of a flat or misshapen head. \n\n## Delayed milestones. Some of you will undoubtedly hear or read that back sleeping has been associated with \n\n## delayed motor development. In addressing the question of delayed milestones—or more specifically, a delay in \n\n## the time when back-sleeping babies first begin to roll over—rest assured that this all seems to even out in the \n\n## end. Even if your baby doesn't take to rolling quite as early as their belly-sleeping counterparts of generations \n\n## past and present, to our knowledge no college application has ever asked applicants how early they mastered the \n\n## ability to roll over (or, for future reference, sit, crawl, walk or toilet train).

She's \n\n## idiosyncratic. She cannot stand to estimate; she must have a precise answer. If the graph paper doesn't have enough \n\n## lines, she gets stuck. \n\n## Trevor : Trevor is an anxious child who now, at the age of 9, very much wants to be like other kids and wants the \n\n## other kids to like him.

If you decided against \n\n## breastfeeding at first, or had breastfeeding challenges \n\n## that led you to wean your baby earlier than you hoped, \n\n## it is sometimes possible to begin again. This is called \n\n## relactation. \n\n## Even if the goal is not to completely nourish your child with breastmilk, relactation can at least let you maintain the \n\n## breastfeeding relationship. This may be especially important if you stopped breastfeeding only to find that your baby \n\n## did not tolerate infant formulas. Read on for more information. \n\n## When does relactation work best? \n\n## Relactation works best if you either gave birth fairly recently (particularly if your child is less than three months old) \n\n## or if your milk supply has been low or nonexistent for only a short period of time. While doctors may prescribe such \n\n## drugs as metoclopramide to adoptive mothers who have not previously breastfed or to women attempting to relactate, \n\n## the baby's frequent suckling and other forms of nipple stimulation, such as an electric breast pump, are critical to \n\n## establishing or reestablishing milk supply. \n\n## Tips to help restart lactation \n\n## If you are attempting to relactate, nurse your baby frequently, whenever they show signs of hunger. Hunger cues \n\n## (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Is-Your-Baby-Hungry-or-Full-Responsive-Feeding","metadata":{"id":1099}}],["1100",{"pageContent":"## (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding-nutrition/Pages/Is-Your-Baby-Hungry-or-Full-Responsive-Feeding\n\n## Explained.aspx) may include a pursed mouth, sucking motions, or increased activity or alertness. You may need to \n\n## nurse 8 to 10 or even more times per day, with 2 or more night feedings, for about 15 to 20 minutes per session. If your \n\n## baby is not eager to nurse as you are building your milk supply, provide them with positive reinforcement by using a \n\n## nursing supplementer to provide formula or expressed or donor human milk. You should also stimulate your breasts \n\n## with breast massage and a good-quality breast pump. \n\n## Set realistic expectations \n\n## Don't expect this process to lead to instant results. Your baby may resist nursing for a week to two before they settle \n\n## back down to breastfeeding, and it may take weeks for your milk supply to increase. To improve your chances of \n\n## relactating, try to keep your nursing sessions relaxed and pleasurable for both you and your child. Drink enough \n\n## fluids, and try to maintain an adequate diet. \n\n## Consider asking for help \n\n## This is a process that will be much easier with the assistance of a physician with special expertise in breastfeeding \n\n## management or a lactation consultant. In addition, you might ask for help from family members and friends who may \n\n## have experienced a similar situation. \n\n## Supplement if needed \n\n## Relactation does not always mean a return to exclusive breastfeeding.

It \n\n## allows her to call for help when she's hungry or \n\n## uncomfortable. It shuts out sights, sounds, and other \n\n## sensations too intense to suit her. And it helps her \n\n## release tension. \n\n## You may notice your baby has fussy periods, even when \n\n## she's not hungry, uncomfortable, or tired. At times it \n\n## may seem like nothing can console her. Right after \n\n## these spells, she may seem more alert than before, and \n\n## then may sleep more deeply than usual. This kind of \n\n## fussy crying seems to help babies get rid of excess \n\n## energy to allow for a more contented state. \n\n## As you get to know your infant's crying patterns, you may feel as if you can identify specific needs by the way she cries. \n\n## Is she hungry? Angry? Distressed or in pain? Sleepy? Each baby will use her voice differently. \n\n## Different types of cries \n\n## Sometimes different types of cries overlap. Newborns generally wake up hungry and crying for food. If you're not \n\n## quick to respond, your baby's hunger cry may turn to a wail of rage. You'll hear the difference. As your baby matures, \n\n## her cries will become stronger, louder, and more insistent. They'll also begin to vary more, as if to convey different \n\n## needs and desires. \n\n## The best way to handle crying is to respond promptly during her first few months. You cannot spoil a young baby with \n\n## attention, and if you answer her calls for help, she'll cry less overall. \n\n## When responding to your child's cries, try to meet her most pressing need first. If she's cold and hungry and her \n\n## diaper is wet, warm her up, change her diaper, and then feed her.

If she's warm, dry, and well fed but the crying won't stop, try the following consoling techniques. \n\n## Find the ones that work best for your baby: \n\n## Rocking, either in a rocking chair or in your arms as you sway from side to side \n\n## Gently stroking her head or patting her back or chest \n\n## Safe swaddling (wrapping her snugly in a receiving blanket) \n\n## Singing or talking \n\n## Playing soft music \n\n## Walking her in your arms, a stroller, or a carriage \n\n## Rhythmic white noise and vibration \n\n## Burping her to relieve any trapped gas bubbles \n\n## Warm baths (most babies like this, but not all) \n\n## When all else fails \n\n## Sometimes, if all else fails, the best approach is simply to leave the baby alone in a safe location such as a crib. Many \n\n## babies cannot fall asleep without crying and will fall asleep quicker if left to cry.

Each family has its own ways of deciding who has the power and authority within the family unit, and which rights, privileges, obligations, and roles are assigned to each family member. In most families parents are expected to be the leaders or executives of the family; children are expected to follow the leadership of their parents. As children in the middle years grow older, they will ask for, and certainly should be allowed, more autonomy, and their opinions should be considered when decisions are made; however, parents are the final authorities. Of course there will always be disagreements among the generations. Your child may want to go to the beach on a family vacation; you may want to go to the mountains. He may think he has too many chores to do; you may think he has just the right amount. Let him speak his mind, but the ultimate decision is yours. Explain why you've made the judgment you have, without becoming defensive or apologetic. You won't always be popular in these decisions, but your youngster is still going to love you. Although generational hierarchies are the most obvious ones within families, other types of hierarchies exist as well. Sometimes they depend on gender. In patriarchal societies such as ours, men have traditionally had power over women, including within the family. Traditionally, fathers have been the providers and authority figures, but while they may be the final decisionmakers, they often have assumed only limited functions beyond that in the family. Mothers have been the caretakers, responsible for the emotional side of the family; they have kept the family together and functioning smoothly. What this means is that mothers and fathers are likely to hold different positions in the family hierarchy, that mothers take primary responsibility and that fathers may have only partial responsibility for day-to-day parental decisions. Today, however, there are challenges to this traditional gender-based structure. In many families both fathers and mothers are bringing home paychecks. And while women still seem to shoulder the larger share of responsibility for the day-to-day operations of the family, more fathers are assuming greater roles in child-raising and household duties. It is useful to consider what roles each family member takes within the family, and whether everyone is satisfied with the current arrangement. For example, the oldest children in the family may take on the parental role of caring for their younger siblings. Or grandparents may acquire an important place within the family by assuming a central child-rearing role while parents work. Think about who is responsible for what within your own family and how the current arrangement is working. Some responsibilities may be open to negotiation, particularly if the family does not seem to be functioning optimally. For example, an older child may be resentful of having too much responsibility for watching over the younger children, while the younger children may also resent the older child playing a parental role. This will result in arguments whenever the oldest child is left in charge. Parents need to review what is going on, discuss how the children are feeling about it, and come up with some alternatives.

The annual number of deaths has remained about the same since 2000 following a substantial decline in deaths in the 1990s as the result of a national educational campaign to put babies on their backs to sleep. \n\n## Sudden unexplained infant deaths: racial & ethnic disparities \n\nWhile overall numbers of deaths have declined, persistent racial and ethnic disparities exist that reflect broader societal inequities, according to research. The rate of sudden unexpected infant deaths (SUIDs) among Black and American Indian/Alaska Native infants was more than double and almost triple, respectively, that of white infants (85 per 100 000 live births) in 2010-2013.","metadata":{"id":1130}}],["1131",{"pageContent":"\"It's essential for families and pediatricians to partner with each other, to build trust and have thoughtful conversations about how to keep children safe by lowering risks,\" said Rebecca Carlin, MD, FAAP, who co-authored the statement and technical report. \"We know that many parents choose to share a bed with a child, for instance, perhaps to help with breastfeeding or because of a cultural preference or a belief that it is safe. \n\n\n## Why AAP does not support bed-sharing with your baby \n\nThe evidence is clear that this significantly raises the risk of a baby's injury or death, however, and for that reason AAP cannot support bed-sharing under any circumstances.\" \n\nThe risks of sleep-related infant deaths are up to 67 times higher when sleeping with someone on a couch or soft armchair or cushion; and 10 times higher when sleeping with someone who is impaired because of fatigue or use of sedating medications or substances such as alcohol or illicit drugs; or is a smoker. Risks of sleeping on the same surface with someone else also increase 5-10 times when an infant is under four months of age; is sharing the surface with someone other than a parent; or is a pre-term or low-birthweight, regardless of other factors. \n\n### To reduce the risk of sleep-related infant death, the AAP recommends: \n\n The baby should sleep on a firm, flat noninclined surface that, at a minimum, adheres to the June 2021 Consumer Product Safety Commission's rule that any infant sleep product must meet existing federal safety standards for cribs, bassinets, play yards, and bedside sleepers. Parents should not use products for sleep that aren't specifically marketed for sleep. \n\n Sitting devices, such as car seats, strollers, swings, infant carriers, and infant slings, are not recommended for routine sleep in the hospital or at home, particularly for infants younger than 4 months.","metadata":{"id":1131}}],["1132",{"pageContent":"Breastfeeding reduces the risk of sleep-related infant deaths, and while any human milk feeding is more protective than none, 2 months of feeding at least partial human milk feeding has been demonstrated to significantly lower the risk of sleep-related deaths. The AAP recommends exclusive human milk feeding to 6 months, with continuation of human milk feeding for 1 year or longer as mutually desired by parent and infant. \n\n AAP recommends that parents sleep in the same room – but not in the same bed as a baby, preferably for at least the first six months. \n\n Avoid parent and infant exposure to nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, opioids, and illicit drugs. \n\n Make sure the baby receives routine immunizations. \n\n Pacifier use is associated with reducing risk. \n\n Avoid the use of commercial devices that claim to reduce the risk of SIDS or other sleep-related deaths. There is no evidence that any of these devices reduce the risk of these deaths. Importantly, the use of products claiming to increase sleep safety may provide a false sense of security and complacency for caregivers. Do not use home cardiorespiratory monitors as a strategy to reduce the risk of SIDS. \n\n Supervised, awake tummy time is recommended to facilitate infant development and to minimize development of positional plagiocephaly. Parents are encouraged to place the infant in tummy time while awake and supervised for short periods of time beginning soon after hospital discharge, increasing incrementally to at least 15 to 30 minutes total daily by 7 weeks of age.","metadata":{"id":1132}}],["1133",{"pageContent":"There is no evidence to recommend swaddling as a strategy to reduce the risk of SIDS. If infants are swaddled, always place them on the back. Weighted swaddles, weighted clothing or weighted objects on or near the baby are not safe and not recommended. When an infant exhibits signs of attempting to roll (which usually occurs at 3 to 4 months but may occur earlier), swaddling is no longer appropriate, as it could increase the risk of suffocation if the swaddled infant rolls to the prone position. \n\n## Unsafe baby products \n\nThe new federal Safe Sleep for Babies Act (https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2022/aapstatement-on-passage-of-the-safe-sleep-for-babies-act/) will help get rid of potentially dangerous baby sleep products (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/Inclined-Sleepers-and-Other-Baby-Registry-Items-to-Avoid.aspx) such as inclined sleepers, in-bed sleepers, loungers and travel/compact sleepers by mid-2022. \n\n\"Parents might think that their infant is waking up too much during the night and fear that something is wrong,\" Dr. Moon said. \"But babies by their nature wake up frequently during the night.

Use safety latches or locks on \n\n### drawers and cupboards. Remember, your child doesn’t understand or remember “no” while exploring. \n\n### If your child does eat something that could be poisonous, call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222 immediately. Do \n\n### not make your child vomit. \n\n## Strangulation and Suffocation \n\n### Place your baby’s crib away from windows. Cords from window blinds and draperies can strangle your child.

Do not knot cords together. \n\n### Plastic wrappers and bags form a tight seal if placed over the mouth and nose and may suffocate your child.

A 2021 study \n\n## (https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(21)00558-9/fulltext) on sexting among youth found these statistics: \n\n## 19.3% had sent a sext \n\n## 34.8% had received a sext \n\n## 14.5% had forwarded a sext without consent \n\n## Females receive more sexts than males \n\n## Older teens are more likely to send sexts \n\n## Older and younger adolescents receive sexts at around the same rate \n\n## Risks of sexting \n\n## While sexting has become more normalized among young people, there are many risks involved for kids and teens. \n\n## These include: \n\n## Mental health and sexual behavior \n\n## There are mental health risk factors and sexual behaviors linked with kids and teens who sext, compared to those that \n\n## don't. Young people who sext are more likely to: \n\n## Have depression and/or anxiety \n\n## Commit minor crimes \n\n## Use alcohol, drugs or cigarettes \n\n## Engage in sexual activity and sex with multiple partners","metadata":{"id":1176}}],["1177",{"pageContent":"## Have depression and/or anxiety \n\n## Commit minor crimes \n\n## Use alcohol, drugs or cigarettes \n\n## Engage in sexual activity and sex with multiple partners \n\n## Not use contraception \n\n\n##### Younger adolescents who sext may be even more susceptible to these risks because of their lack of experience and \n\n##### immaturity. They also tend to be more vulnerable to digital dangers such as bullying or \"sextortion.\" This is a type of \n\n##### blackmail used to get people to send sexually explicit photos or money so that their private information isn't posted \n\n##### online. \n\n### Legal risks \n\n##### There's also the potential legal trouble kids can get into, whether they're sending or receiving sexts. Some states \n\n##### (https://cyberbullying.org/sexting-laws) will even prosecute minors with a felony charge, which can mean up to 20 \n\n##### years in prison. Minors may also be permanently placed on sex offender lists. \n\n### Other risks \n\n##### There are other risks with sexting too, risks that young people may not think about, including: \n\n##### You don't have any control over the video or picture once it's sent. Even people you trust may forward it to others. \n\n##### You could be bullied by peers who see the sext. \n\n##### You may regret sending a sext, especially if it's shared with others. You may feel humiliation or embarrassment. \n\n##### This can lead to serious emotional distress. \n\n##### If your video or picture is posted online, you are vulnerable to attention you don't want from others, perhaps even \n\n##### predators. \n\n## When & how to discuss sexting with your kids \n\n##### Just as you'd have \"the sex talk (/English/ages-stages/teen/dating-sex/Pages/Adolescent-Sexuality-Talk-the-Talk\n\n##### Before-They-Walk-the-Walk.aspx),\" you should also should start the conversation about sexting before a problem \n\n##### develops.

Ask your \n\n##### child if they've heard of sexting and what they think it is. It's important to first learn what your child's \n\n##### understanding is of the issue. After that, you can add age-appropriate information as needed. \n\n##### Use examples that fit your child's age when giving them information and guidance. For younger children \n\n##### with cell phones who may know little about sex, let them know that text messages should never contain pictures \n\n##### or videos of people—kids or adults—without their clothes on, engaged in extended kissing or touching private \n\n##### parts. For older children, use the term \"sexting\" and ask if they've been exposed to nude or seminude images or \n\n##### sexual activities such as \"making out\"—or more. \n\n##### Be very specific—especially with teens—that sexting often involves pictures or videos of a sexual nature, \n\n##### including nude and seminude photos and sexual activities. Some sexts can be considered pornography or \n\n##### child pornography. Depending on the state, both senders and receivers could be charged and prosecuted. \n\n##### Make sure kids of all ages understand that sexting is serious and considered a crime in many \n\n##### jurisdictions. There can be serious consequences for sexting, quite possibly involving the police. Teens may be \n\n##### suspended from school and have labels on their permanent record that could hurt their chances of getting into \n\n##### college or getting a job. \n\n##### Inform your children that texts, images and videos on the internet can remain there forever.

This is normal. \n\n## It's good. It's about love, pride and building community. \n\n## But with the explosion of social media, those funny \n\n## stories—or cute pictures and videos—that you used to \n\n## share with just your family, your officemates or the \n\n## other parents at the playground can now be shared with \n\n## literally the entire world.

Get in the habit of \n\n##### asking it of yourself before you post. \n\n##### Would you want someone to share it about you? This isn't always the perfect barometer, as you might be an \n\n##### extrovert who is happy to share and your child might grow up to be an introvert who likes to be private...but if \n\n##### you would be bummed if your parent shared a picture of you naked on a potty, maybe you shouldn't share the \n\n##### same picture of your child. If your child is old enough to ask, ask them. \n\n##### Could your child be embarrassed by it, now or in the future? Granted, it's part of the parental job \n\n##### description to embarrass our children. But it's one thing to tell an embarrassing story or show an embarrassing \n\n##### picture to a girlfriend or grandmother—and it's another thing to send the information out to the world.

If the answer is yes, don't share it. I know that sounds extreme, but it's growing more common for \n\n##### employers, college admission staff or possible romantic interests among others to do Internet searches about \n\n##### people. If what you are thinking of posting could come back to bite your child in any way ever, don't do it. And as \n\n##### a corollary... \n\n##### Is this something you want to be part of your child's digital footprint? Even if it's not embarrassing, how \n\n##### does it paint your child? Think about it. You'd probably like your child to come across as smart, well-behaved, \n\n##### industrious, kind and successful, right? Does what you are posting help that—or hinder it? \n\n##### It's a good idea to talk with your partner, to be sure you are on the same page (my husband always has editing rights \n\n##### too when I write about our children). It's also a good idea to discuss it as a family once your children are old enough to \n\n##### understand.

Hashikawa, MD, MS, FAAP \n\n## We have learned a lot recently about how to help kids \n\n## in child care avoid getting sick when respiratory \n\n## illnesses are spreading. \n\n## Still, infants in child care under age 6 months are too \n\n## young to get flu (influenza) or COVID vaccines. \n\n## Children younger than 2 years are too young to wear a \n\n## mask. Masks are recommended in areas with medium \n\n## and high community levels of COVID and any time \n\n## spread is more likely. \n\n## What can be done to keep children healthy? \n\n## Get a flu shot \n\n## For kids in child care settings, staying up to date on vaccines like flu vaccinations is key. Flu shots will not prevent \n\n## COVID, the cold, or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). But like these illnesses, the flu can make babies and young \n\n## children very sick. \n\n## Nearly every flu season, very young children are hit the hardest by the flu. In 2019-2020 (before the pandemic), a \n\n## record-breaking 199 children died from the flu (/English/health-issues/conditions/flu/Pages/default.aspx). Most who \n\n## died that year had not received flu vaccinations. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), \n\n## by Dec. 31, the flu already led to 74 deaths among children this season. \n\n## Flu vaccines protect babies and young kids. That way, it is much less (https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/p0113\n\n## flu-vaccine-children.html) likely they will need hospital care or die from flu complications. The American Academy of \n\n## Pediatrics recommends flu vaccines (/English/news/Pages/Influenza-Vaccines-Can-Protect-Children-against-the\n\n## Flu-During-Pandemic.aspx) for babies and children 6 months of age and older. Your child can catch up on all \n\n## immunizations at a well-child visit (/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Recommended-Immunization\n\n## Schedules.aspx).","metadata":{"id":1199}}],["1200",{"pageContent":"## immunizations at a well-child visit (/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Recommended-Immunization\n\n## Schedules.aspx). \n\n## And remember, parents and child care staff need annual flu shots, too. Child care staff may have received their COVID \n\n## vaccines. But COVID shots do not protect us from the flu. \n\n## It's not too late! \n\n## Many children still need to get a flu shot this season. The timing of flu season can change each year. Flu season \n\n## usually starts in October, peaks in February and may last into May. \n\n## Children are also still getting infected with COVID. Children eligible for a flu shot and COVID shot can get both at the \n\n## same visit. The AAP recommends COVID vaccines for everyone age 6 months and older. Adults and kids who are \n\n## eligible should get an updated COVID booster (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster\n\n## shot.html), too, when it is time. (Read about COVID vaccines for kids here (/English/health-issues/conditions/COVID\n\n## 19/Pages/Getting-Your-Child-Ready-for-the-COVID-19-Vaccine.aspx).) \n\n## Flu shots protect the people around us. \n\n## What happens at daycare when everyone is up to date on vaccinations? \n\n## Kids can stay in school and other activities. \n\n\n### Adults will not have to miss work or obligations. \n\n### We protect children who are too young to get vaccinated. \n\n### Community immunity through influenza vaccination helps keep those around us safe—people at high risk of \n\n### serious illness, like cancer patients and our grandparents. Older people (65 years and older \n\n### (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/65over.htm)) need flu shots, too. They are at higher risk of getting very sick \n\n### from the flu. \n\n## Serious flu illness and death can be (mostly) avoided. \n\n### We all know that little kids like to put everything in their mouths!

Children may need hospital care if their body becomes too weak from the flu. \n\n### Sometimes, children develop complications from being sick, like pneumonia (when the infection spreads to the \n\n### lungs). \n\n### There is no cure for the flu.

During the study, medical staff will watch your child sleep. Several sensors will \n\n## be attached to your child to monitor (/English/ages-stages/baby/preemie/Pages/Apnea-Monitors.aspx) breathing, \n\n## oxygenation, and brain waves (electroencephalogram; EEG). \n\n## The results of the study will show whether your child suffers from sleep apnea.

It is \n\n## highly effective in treating sleep apnea. \n\n## Another effective treatment is nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which requires the child to wear a \n\n## mask while he sleeps. The mask delivers steady air pressure through the child's nose, allowing him to breathe \n\n## comfortably. Continuous positive airway pressure is usually used in children who do not improve after tonsillectomy \n\n## and adenoidectomy, or who are not candidates for tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. \n\n## Children born with other medical conditions, such as Down syndrome (/English/health\n\n## issues/conditions/developmental-disabilities/Pages/Down-Syndrome.aspx), cerebral palsy (/English/health\n\n## issues/conditions/developmental-disabilities/Pages/Cerebral-Palsy.aspx), or craniofacial (skull and face) \n\n## abnormalities (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Positional-Skull-Deformities-in-Infants-Audio.aspx), are at higher \n\n## risk for sleep apnea.

If she is increasingly resisting a rigid bathroom schedule, it may be better to allow her to choose when she goes \n\n## —even at her child-care center or preschool.

He is at its center, and while you may be close at hand, he is most concerned \n\n## about where things are in relation to himself. He knows that other people exist, and they vaguely \n\n## interest him, but he has no idea how they think or what they feel. As far as he’s concerned, \n\n## everyone thinks as he does. \n\n## As you can imagine, his view of the world (technically, some experts call it egocentric or self\n\n## centered) often makes it difficult for him to play with other children in a truly social sense. He’ll \n\n## play alongside and compete for toys, but he doesn’t play cooperative games easily. He’ll enjoy \n\n## watching and being around other children, especially if they’re slightly older. He may imitate them or treat them the \n\n## way he does dolls, for example, trying to brush their hair, but he’s usually surprised and resists when they try to do the \n\n## same thing to him. He may offer them toys or things to eat but may get upset if they respond by taking what he’s \n\n## offered them. \n\n## Sharing is a meaningless term to a child this age. Every toddler believes that he alone deserves the spotlight. \n\n## Unfortunately, most are also as assertive as they are self centered, and competition for toys and attention frequently \n\n## erupts into hitting and tears. How can you minimize the combat when your child’s “friends” are over? Try providing \n\n## plenty of toys for everyone and be prepared to referee. \n\n## As we’ve suggested earlier, your child also may start to show possessiveness over toys that he knows belong to him. \n\n## If another child even touches the plaything, he may rush over and snatch it away.

When they’re upset, they can hit or slap \n\n## without realizing they are hurting the other child.

In turn, it may influence their self-esteem or get \n\n#### them to take part in dangerous internet challenges (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/Dangerous-Internet\n\n#### Challenges.aspx). \n\n### What parents can do \n\n#### Help your kids become savvy about ridiculous beauty standards, extreme stunts, challenges or over-the-top social \n\n#### media posts that may appear in their feed. Also help them understand that more extreme posts go \"viral\" because \n\n#### social media companies make more advertising money, and collect more data, when users are sharing and interacting \n\n#### more. \n\n## The big picture \n\n#### Whether your child is already on social media or they're asking you if they can start, be sure to go through your family \n\n#### rules for using it.

This reluctance can grow even stronger during periods when mastery of their body or privacy becomes a \n\n## high-priority issue in their lives, or when they are experiencing a fear of the potty or of some other aspect of bowel \n\n## training that they are unable to articulate. \n\n## In most cases, hiding or playing with stool, or resistance to bowel training, is a normal part of early childhood that will \n\n## soon pass if you do not respond to it in an overemotional way. Instead, calmly ask your child why he is behaving in this \n\n## way, firmly remind him of the rules about where stool goes, and work to come up with a solution to his problem— \n\n## preferably with his help.

Once awake, she’ll move into one of the three remaining states. \n\n## She may be wide awake, happy, and alert but relatively motionless (State 4).

As a parent, how do you know when disfluencies are a \n\n## normal part of development and when to be more concerned? Read \n\n## on. \n\n## What are Typical Disfluencies? \n\n## It is not uncommon for young children to have disfluencies in their \n\n## speech (e.g., word or phrase repetitions). In fact, about 5% of all \n\n## children are likely to be disfluent at some point in their \n\n## development, usually between ages 2 ½ and 5. It is also very typical \n\n## for a child to go back and forth between periods of fluency and disfluency. Sometimes, this can occur for no apparent \n\n## reason, but often this happens when a child is excited, tired, or feels rushed to speak. \n\n## Learning language rules: \n\n## During this time, children are expanding their vocabularies rapidly and learning complex language rules. These rules \n\n## allow children to change simple messages (\"Mommy juice\") into longer, more complicated sentences that require \n\n## more motor coordination to produce smoothly (\"Mommy put the juice in the blue cup\"). It's only natural that there \n\n## may be some disruptions along the way. \n\n## Is It Truly Stuttering? \n\n## For most toddlers and preschoolers, most disfluencies go away on their own after a short period of time. In other \n\n## cases, disfluencies persist and the signs of stuttering become more obvious. Getting professional help early offers the \n\n## best chances for reducing stuttering. But how can parents tell the difference between typical disfluency that will \n\n## go away and the early signs of non-typical disfluencies that may indicate stuttering? \n\n## Here are some ways to differentiate typical disfluency from stuttering: \n\n\n### If your child is truly stuttering, he or she may hold out the first sound in a word, saying \"Ssssssssometimes we stay","metadata":{"id":1272}}],["1273",{"pageContent":"## Here are some ways to differentiate typical disfluency from stuttering: \n\n\n### If your child is truly stuttering, he or she may hold out the first sound in a word, saying \"Ssssssssometimes we stay \n\n### home,\" or repeat the sound, as in \"Look at the b-b-b-baby!\" In addition, children who stutter often develop other \n\n#### mannerisms such as eye blinking, tense mouth, looking to the side, and avoiding eye contact. \n\n## Risk Factors for Stuttering: \n\n#### There are other risk factors that can help predict whether fluency problems will continue for longer than a few \n\n#### months. \n\n#### Family history is the biggest predictor of whether a child is likely to stutter. \n\n#### Gender. Young boys are twice as likely as young girls to stutter, and elementary school-age boys are 3 to 4 times \n\n#### more likely to stutter than girls. \n\n#### Age of onset. Children that start having difficulties at age 4 are more likely to have a persistent stutter than those \n\n#### who begin stuttering at a younger age. \n\n#### Co-existing speech and/or language disorders increase the likelihood a child may stutter. \n\n## Getting Help: \n\n#### If you are concerned about your child's speech, talk with your pediatrician about getting a speech and language \n\n#### evaluation. A complete evaluation from a certified speech-language pathologist can help you to better determine if \n\n#### the stuttering is likely to persist. \n\n#### Speech-language pathologists will help parents determine the best course of action (e.g., closely monitoring the \n\n#### child's fluency, enrolling in treatment services, and/or parent education). The American Speech-Language-Hearing \n\n#### Association (ASHA) offers a searchable database (http://www.asha.org/profind/) of these professionals. In addition, a \n\n#### list of clinicians who specialize in stuttering can be found here \n\n#### (http://www.stutteringspecialists.org/search/custom.asp?id=1972). \n\n## Treatment Approaches for Stuttering:","metadata":{"id":1273}}],["1274",{"pageContent":"#### list of clinicians who specialize in stuttering can be found here \n\n#### (http://www.stutteringspecialists.org/search/custom.asp?id=1972). \n\n## Treatment Approaches for Stuttering: \n\n#### Early treatment for stuttering is very important, as it is more likely to be eliminated when a child is young (before \n\n#### entering elementary school). There are two main treatment approaches for stuttering: \n\n#### Indirect treatment is when the speech-language pathologist helps the child's parents on how to modify their \n\n#### own communication styles. Indirect approaches are effective at reducing or even eliminating stuttering in many \n\n#### young children. \n\n#### Direct treatment involves the speech-language pathologist working with the children themselves either one\n\n#### on-one or in small groups, giving them specific speech strategies for easing into words and reducing tension \n\n#### during stuttering events. In addition, direct treatment may involve helping the child to differentiate between \n\n#### smooth (fluent) and bumpy (stuttered) speech. \n\n#### After age 7, it becomes unlikely that stuttering will go away completely. Still, after age 7, treatment can be very \n\n#### effective at helping a child effectively manage stuttering—helping develop skills necessary to handle difficult \n\n#### situations (e.g., teasing and bullying) and participate fully in school and activities. For older children, speech treatment \n\n#### is still beneficial, encouraged, and effective in helping to reduce the severity and impact of stuttering. \n\n## What Parents Can Do: \n\n#### Here are some ways parents can help: \n\n#### Reduce communication stress. There are different techniques to put less pressure on a child in a speaking \n\n### situation. Rephrasing questions as comments (using \" You played outside today at school. It must have been fun!\" \n\n### instead of \"What did you do at school?\") is one effective approach. Parents can also do their best to reduce \n\n#### situations that trigger their child's stuttering.","metadata":{"id":1274}}],["1275",{"pageContent":"### instead of \"What did you do at school?\") is one effective approach. Parents can also do their best to reduce \n\n#### situations that trigger their child's stuttering. \n\n#### Talk about it. When children are aware of their stuttering, it is best to be open and talk about it in a positive way. \n\n#### Let them know it is okay to have \"bumpy speech.\" If a child does not seem to be aware of the problem, there is no \n\n#### need to bring it up until you are seeing a speech-language pathologist. \n\n##### Back to Top \n\n\n#### Practice patience. Give children time to finish what they are saying. Don't rush or interrupt them. Don't tell \n\n### them to \"slow down\" or \"think about what you want to say.\" Phrases such as those are generally not helpful to \n\n#### children who stutter. \n\n#### Model good speech habits. While telling a child how to talk is generally not helpful, parents can model speech \n\n#### habits that help with stuttering, such as slowing down their own speed when they talk, putting in more pauses \n\n#### between sentences, and speaking in a relaxed manner. \n\n#### Seek a professional. There are many ways to find a speech-language pathologist. A child's pediatrician can \n\n#### provide a recommendation. Children younger than 3 can receive a free evaluation through their local Early \n\n#### Intervention Program (http://ectacenter.org/families.asp). If a child is older than 3, parents can contact their local \n\n#### public school for a free evaluation.

Falusi, MD, MEd, FAAP \n\n## Of all the issues I've discussed with parents of infants \n\n## over the years, I have to say that sudden, unexplained \n\n## death is one of the hardest. \n\n## Every year, more than 3,000 babies in the U.S. die of \n\n## sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and other causes \n\n## that are unclear at first, including accidental \n\n## suffocation or strangulation. The shock, grief, and guilt \n\n## felt by families who lose an infant can be crushing. \n\n## Here are questions parents and caregivers often ask \n\n## about SIDS, along with the insights from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) that can help you address and \n\n## reduce your baby's risks of dying from SIDS. \n\n## What exactly is SIDS? \n\n## SIDS is the unexplained death of a seemingly healthy baby less than a year old. Most of these deaths occur while \n\n## babies are sleeping, which is why we also call these deaths \"sleep-related deaths.\" In the past, SIDS was sometimes \n\n## called \"crib death,\" but most of these deaths do not occur in cribs. \n\n## Why is it unsafe for a baby to sleep on their stomach? \n\n## Research suggests that SIDS may be caused by defects in the part of an infant's brain that controls breathing and the \n\n## ability to wake up. If a baby is not getting enough oxygen, it is important for the baby to wake up. This is probably why \n\n## stomach sleeping is dangerous. Babies who sleep on their stomachs sleep more deeply, and it's harder for them to \n\n## wake up if they are not getting enough oxygen. \n\n## Does SIDS run in families? \n\n## Experts are still working on understanding this, but we know that little ones whose siblings or cousins died of SIDS \n\n## face higher risks of dying from SIDS. \n\n## Are there other risks (/English/tips-tools/ask-the\n\n## pediatrician/Pages/are-some-babies-at-higher-risk-for-sids.aspx) I \n\n## should know about?","metadata":{"id":1277}}],["1278",{"pageContent":"## face higher risks of dying from SIDS. \n\n## Are there other risks (/English/tips-tools/ask-the\n\n## pediatrician/Pages/are-some-babies-at-higher-risk-for-sids.aspx) I \n\n## should know about? \n\n## Low birth weight and being born preterm can increase the risk for SIDS since a smaller or preterm infant's brain \n\n## might not be mature enough to control breathing and heart rate, especially during sleep. \n\n## Twins, triplets, and other multiple births also have higher risks since they may be born with low birth weight and \n\n## preterm. \n\n## Are parents to blame for some SIDS deaths? \n\n## When talking about SIDS, we should NEVER force blame, shame, judgment, or guilt on anyone. SIDS can happen to any \n\n## family, as we can see from stories like this one (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/Safe-Sleep-Charlies\n\n## Story.aspx). \n\n\n### Babies who die likely have a problem with waking up when they are not getting enough oxygen. When this is coupled \n\n### with sleep situations where babies don't get enough oxygen (such as sleeping on the stomach or side; sleeping with \n\n### other people; sleeping with blankets, pillows, and other soft bedding; sleeping with the head elevated or on an inclined \n\n### surface), the baby can die. This is the basis for the safe sleep guidelines every family can follow. Here are updated \n\n### guidelines (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/A-Parents-Guide-to-Safe-Sleep.aspx) shared earlier this year by \n\n### the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). \n\n## How do the AAP safe sleep guidelines help families reduce SIDS \n\n## risks? \n\n### If you're caring for an infant under a year old, I hope you'll study the full guidelines—but let's start with some \n\n### highlights. First, babies should always sleep on their backs. Infants who sleep on their tummies or sides may have \n\n### trouble getting enough oxygen and trouble waking up, so parents and caregivers should follow the \"back to sleep\" rule \n\n### at naptime and nighttime.","metadata":{"id":1278}}],["1279",{"pageContent":"### trouble getting enough oxygen and trouble waking up, so parents and caregivers should follow the \"back to sleep\" rule \n\n### at naptime and nighttime. \n\n### We also know that placing babies for sleep on a firm, flat surface that meets CPSC safety standards (like a crib, \n\n### bassinet, or play yard) protects them from SIDS. Little ones should never sleep on a fluffy comforter, a couch or \n\n### armchair, a waterbed, or padded play spaces like baby nests, since soft surfaces can easily block their noses and \n\n### airways. Your baby's sleep space should also be kept 100% free of pillows, blankets, bumper pads, plush toys, and other \n\n### soft objects that can block breathing. \n\n### Overheating has been linked with higher SIDS risks, so your child's room should be kept at a temperature that is \n\n### comfortable. In warmer conditions, parents and caregivers should check for sweating, a hot chest, or flushed skin—all \n\n### signs that babies are suffering from heat distress. \n\n## Should I bring my baby into my own bed so I can watch over them? \n\n### No, this is one thing you should NEVER do. Bed-sharing has caused countless infant deaths, which can happen when \n\n### adults or bigger siblings shift during sleep, trapping a little one in an unsafe position. The pillows and blankets we use \n\n### on our own beds can also block infants' breathing. In fact, the AAP states unequivocally that there is no safe way to \n\n### sleep with your baby on the same bed, chair, couch or other surface. I hope this is one rule you'll follow every time. \n\n## Is there a safe way to monitor my infant, especially at night? \n\n### You can sleep in the same room with your infant for at least the first six months, which makes it much easier for you to \n\n### feed, soothe and keep track of them. You don't have to move into the nursery, of course! Instead, most parents place a \n\n### crib, bassinet, cradle, or play yard outfitted with a firm mattress in their own bedroom. Room sharing reduces SIDS","metadata":{"id":1279}}],["1280",{"pageContent":"### crib, bassinet, cradle, or play yard outfitted with a firm mattress in their own bedroom. Room sharing reduces SIDS \n\n### risks by as much as 50%, so it's well worth the extra effort. \n\n## Does breastfeeding protect babies from SIDS? \n\n### It does! Feeding your baby human milk for at least 2 months reduces your baby's risk of SIDS by at least 50%. This may \n\n### be because infants who consume only human milk may wake more easily and often than formula-fed infants. These \n\n### frequent awakenings are protective for the baby. \n\n### The immune boost that breastfeeding gives your child may also play a role in safe sleep. Here are more reasons the \n\n### AAP recommends feeding only breast milk to your child (/English/ages-stages/baby/breastfeeding/Pages/Where\n\n### We-Stand-Breastfeeding.aspx) for at least the first six months, and longer if you wish. \n\n## Does smoke exposure increase a baby's chances of dying from SIDS? \n\n### Studies show that smoking even 1 cigarette per day while pregnant doubles the risk of SIDS.Exposing babies to \n\n### secondhand smoke after they're born will also elevate their chances of dying from SIDS. There are many possible \n\n### reasons for this, including the fact that children exposed to secondhand smoke suffer from more colds and \n\n### respiratory problems than those living in smoke-free homes. Also, one in five babies born to people who smoked \n\n### during pregnancy will have low birth weight, another risk factor for SIDS. \n\n### For their health and safety, NEVER smoke near your baby. This includes vaping and e-cigarettes, which contain \n\n### nicotine.

Don't worry if your baby spits it out at first, since you can always try again later. \n\n### As for other devices, I would strongly suggest you NOT use a home heart monitor in hopes of reducing your child's \n\n### risks for SIDS.

Jana, MD, FAAP & Jennifer Shu, MD, FAAP \n\n## Before you lay your baby down to sleep at night or for a \n\n## nap, consider these safety tips and practical \n\n## considerations. \n\n## Sleeping solo or filling the \n\n## family bed \n\n## Probably since the beginning of time, babies and \n\n## parents around the world have slept together in what \n\n## has come to be commonly referred to as \"the family \n\n## bed.\" But in recent years, particularly in industrialized nations such as the United States, the trend has been to have \n\n## children sleep separately starting from birth. Given that this trend is in keeping with what we now know to be safest \n\n## for babies, we suggest you let common sense and a strong commitment to safety prevail. \n\n## The family bed. Whether because of space limitations, cultural norms, or a strong belief that bed-sharing is an \n\n## integral part of parenting, parents have slept with their babies for thousands of years. In many parts of the world \n\n## and in a good 60% of US households, many babies still sleep in bed with their parents, at least on occasion, despite \n\n## increasing concerns about the associated risks. Followers of attachment parenting seem to feel quite strongly \n\n## that parents and babies benefit most from bonding whenever possible, including during sleep. Proponents also \n\n## feel that bed-sharing makes breastfeeding easier. We encourage you to read on for some important things to \n\n## consider before you opt for the family bed. \n\n## Sleeping solo. By sleeping solo, we don't mean to imply in a different room, just not in the same bed. In the \n\n## United States, there has been a definite shift toward placing babies down for sleep independently, whether in a \n\n## crib, cradle, or bassinet. Our country's movement toward independent sleep may well be, in part, attributable to \n\n## recent and well-founded concerns that bed-sharing in the first year increases the risk of sleep-related infant","metadata":{"id":1283}}],["1284",{"pageContent":"## recent and well-founded concerns that bed-sharing in the first year increases the risk of sleep-related infant \n\n## deaths. Other practical reasons why parents opt for solo sleeping: they find it to be safer, sounder (for their baby \n\n## and themselves), and less intrusive on their \"adult\" time. \n\n## Bed-sharing safety concerns \n\n## Many new parents are tempted to take their newborn into bed with them—often out of fatigue and convenience, as \n\n## well as for cultural and philosophical reasons. Whether bed-sharing is safe, however, has been the subject of much \n\n## debate. Recent studies suggest that bed-sharing may significantly increase the risk of infant suffocation, so you'll find \n\n## that many experts (including those responsible for writing AAP policy) now strongly advise against it and instead \n\n## suggest the very practical and safer alternative of sharing the same room but not the same bed during your baby's first \n\n## year. If you choose to sleep with your baby in your bed, even if only infrequently, here are some extremely important \n\n## safety considerations. \n\n## Make your bed like a crib. The heavy blankets, comforters, pillows, and other accessories typically found on \n\n## adult beds can suffocate or smother a baby and therefore have no place being in the same location where \n\n## newborns sleep. (While we're on the subject of simple yet potentially lifesaving measures, we also strongly \n\n## recommend removing any and all such items that may have already found their way into your baby's crib.) \n\n## Bed-sharing babies are at risk from falls or the possibility of being trapped between the mattress and the wall, \n\n## headboard, or other furniture. \n\n## Bed-sharing and the use of tobacco, alcohol, or drugs don't mix. These substances, including over-the\n\n## counter or prescription medications, all have the distinct potential to cause excessive drowsiness or impaired \n\n## judgment, making those who choose to indulge at risk of being less aware of a baby in the bed.","metadata":{"id":1284}}],["1285",{"pageContent":"## judgment, making those who choose to indulge at risk of being less aware of a baby in the bed. \n\n\n## Crib safety considerations \n\n#### Whether you decide to set up a crib for your baby as soon as your pregnancy test turns positive or months after your \n\n#### newborn's much-anticipated arrival, there are a few general safety principles that you'll want to follow to ensure your \n\n#### baby's safety. Some may not seem particularly relevant during your baby's first few months, but given that cribs tend \n\n#### to be big-ticket items and the one you invest in is going to be put to the test for years to come as your baby learns to \n\n#### roll, sit, stand and climb in it, it's well worth considering present and future safety concerns. \n\n#### Crib slats. The slats should be no more than 2-3/8 inches apart. All new cribs must meet this standard, but older \n\n#### cribs may not. Avoid using any crib that does not meet this 2011 standard. \n\n#### Posts & cutouts. Steer clear of bedposts taller than 1/16th of an inch (we realize that's almost nothing, but that's \n\n#### the point) and/or cutouts in the headboard or any other parts of the crib, where a baby's or toddler's body parts \n\n#### could get stuck. \n\n#### Bumpers and pillows. Yes, they're soft and cute. But soft and cute should not be your deciding factor. For safety's \n\n#### sake, keep crib bumpers and pillows out of your baby's crib. \n\n#### Crib toys. They may seem harmless, entertaining, cute and cuddly, but keep all stuffed animals (and most toys) \n\n#### out of your newborn's crib because they can pose a small but nevertheless real safety risk. The exceptions are the \n\n#### types of toys that strap securely to the side of the crib. Some babies like mirrors or toys with parts they can play \n\n#### with (such as spinners, rattles, and music), but your newborn probably won't be terribly interested in them for at \n\n#### least a few weeks. \n\n#### Mobiles.

Mobiles are special hanging toys designed to entertain your baby and can be attached to the crib, \n\n#### ceiling or wall. Some are even adorned with lights or play music. They are fun but definitely optional. If you do \n\n#### choose to use mobiles, make sure they do not hang low enough to entangle your baby, especially once they begin \n\n#### to roll. In fact, once your baby is able to sit up, it will definitely be time for their mobile to come down. \n\n#### Crib placement. Unless you don't mind a bit of redecorating and rearranging when your baby starts to get \n\n#### around, we suggest you place your crib well away from any windows and no less than an arm's reach away from \n\n#### any nearby dressers or tabletops. Knowing that it won't be long before anything and everything within reach will \n\n#### be fair game, we also recommend limiting your over-the-crib wall decorations to painted walls and wallpaper. \n\n#### Picture frames and mirrors over cribs may be cute, but they are also injuries waiting to happen. Be forewarned \n\n#### that while they may be safe, even paper borders placed within reach of the crib don't often stand up well to prying \n\n#### fingers. \n\n#### Firm-fitting mattress/fitted sheet. While they seem to be mostly standardized, cribs and mattresses can and do \n\n#### come in more than one size. So be sure to double-check measurements and read labels to make sure you end up \n\n#### with a mattress that fits snugly into your chosen crib. Any extra space between the mattress and crib frame has \n\n#### the potential to trap a baby's arm, leg or head. Also make sure your fitted sheets are tight enough that they don't \n\n#### slip off easily, thus posing a serious safety hazard. \n\n#### Tooth-resistant rails. Some railings are covered by a special plastic to prevent teething babies from gnawing on \n\n#### the paint or wood. \n\n#### Adjustable mattress height.

Many cribs have adjustable heights so you can lower the mattress as your baby \n\n#### gets taller, making it more difficult for them to climb out. You will likely want to keep it at the highest level while \n\n#### your newborn is relatively immobile and you are coming and going frequently because it will allow you to save a \n\n#### good deal of strain on your back. Remember that by the time your baby is able to sit or stand up, you'll want to \n\n#### lower the level of the crib mattress accordingly. \n\n## Bare is best when it comes to cribs \n\n#### If you come to find that the excitement you feel about having a new baby is wrapped up in the buying of a fancy baby \n\n#### bedding set complete with bumper and quilted blanket, we suggest you work on changing your mindset rather than \n\n#### your nursery décor. Simply remember that the AAP recommends that nothing but a snugly fitted sheet be placed with \n\n#### your baby in the crib during the first year. \n\n## Why drop-side cribs are a thing of the past \n\n#### In years past, crib railings were almost always adjustable—meaning you could raise and lower one or both side \n\n#### railings.

Moon, MD, FAAP & Danette Glassy, MD, FAAP \n\n## New parents often learn how to swaddle their infant \n\n## from the nurses in the hospital. A thin blanket wrapped \n\n## snuggly around your baby's body can resemble the \n\n## womb and help soothe your newborn. When done \n\n## correctly, swaddling can be an effective technique to \n\n## help calm infants and promote sleep (/English/ages\n\n## stages/baby/sleep/Pages/default.aspx). \n\n## But if you plan to swaddle your infant at home, you need \n\n## to follow a few guidelines to make sure you are doing it \n\n## safely. \n\n## Back to sleep \n\n## To reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/Preventing-SIDS.aspx), \n\n## or SIDS, it's important to place your baby to sleep on their back–every time you put them to sleep. This may be even \n\n## more important if your baby is swaddled. Some studies have shown an increased risk of SIDS and unintentional \n\n## suffocation when babies are swaddled if they are placed on their stomach to sleep, or if they roll onto their stomach. If \n\n## babies are swaddled, they should be placed only on their back and monitored so they don't roll over. \n\n## When to stop swaddling \n\n## Stop swaddling as soon as your baby shows any signs of trying to roll over. Some babies start working on rolling as \n\n## early as 2 months of age, but every baby is different. There is no evidence with regard to SIDS risk related to the arms \n\n## swaddled in or out. \n\n## Know the risks \n\n## Parents should know that there are some risks to swaddling. Swaddling may decrease a baby's arousal, so that it's \n\n## harder for them to wake up. That is why swaddling can seem so attractive to new, sleep-deprived parents—the baby \n\n## sleeps longer and doesn't wake up as easily. But we know that decreased arousal can be a problem and may be one of \n\n## the main reasons that babies die of SIDS. \n\n## AAP safe sleep recommendations","metadata":{"id":1290}}],["1291",{"pageContent":"## sleeps longer and doesn't wake up as easily.

A safe sleep space (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/a-parents\n\n## guide-to-safe-sleep.aspx) for infants should stay free of any loose bedding or soft objects. However, as with \n\n## regular blanket swaddling, the use of wearable blankets or sleep sacks that compress the arms, chest and body \n\n## should stop once a baby shows signs of starting to roll over. Sleep sacks that do not swaddle and allow the baby to \n\n## move freely can be used as long as you want. \n\n\n#### Do not have any loose blankets in your baby's crib (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/New-Crib\n\n#### Standards-What-Parents-Need-to-Know.aspx).

Studies have found that straightening and \n\n#### tightly wrapping a baby's legs can lead to hip dislocation or hip dysplasia (/English/health\n\n#### issues/conditions/orthopedic/Pages/Hip-Dysplasia.aspx). This is an abnormal formation of the hip joint where the top \n\n#### of the thigh bone is not held firmly in the socket of the hip. \n\n#### The Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America, with the AAP Section on Orthopaedics, promotes \"hip-healthy \n\n#### swaddling\" that allows the baby's legs to bend up and out. \n\n## How to swaddle correctly \n\n#### Use only a thin blanket for swaddling. \n\n#### To swaddle, spread the blanket out flat, with one corner folded down. \n\n#### Lay the baby face-up on the blanket, with their head above the folded corner. \n\n#### Straighten their left arm and wrap the left corner of the blanket over your baby's body, tucking it between their \n\n#### right arm and the right side of their body. \n\n#### Then tuck the right arm down, and fold the right corner of the blanket over her body and under their left side. \n\n#### Fold or twist the bottom of the blanket loosely and tuck it under one side of the baby.","metadata":{"id":1292}}],["1293",{"pageContent":"#### Fold or twist the bottom of the blanket loosely and tuck it under one side of the baby. \n\n#### Make sure their hips can move and that the blanket is not too tight.

This is because of the increased \n\n#### risks of SIDS or suffocation (/English/family-life/work-play/Pages/A-Child-Care-Provider%27s-Guide-to-Safe\n\n#### Sleep.aspx) if the baby rolls over while swaddled, in addition to the other risks of overheating and hip dysplasia. \n\n#### Compared to a private home, where one or two people are caring for an infant, a child care center usually has a \n\n#### number of caregivers who may have variations in their swaddling technique. This raises a concern because studies \n\n#### show babies who are not usually swaddled react differently when swaddled for the first time at this older age. They \n\n#### may have a harder time waking up, which increases their risk of SIDS. \n\n#### The difference in the advice for swaddling at home or the hospital nursery, versus in a child care center, really comes \n\n#### down to the age of the child and the setting.

Children do best when routines are \n\n## regular, predictable, and consistent. \n\n## One of a family's greatest challenges is to establish comfortable, \n\n## effective routines, which should achieve a happy compromise \n\n## between the disorder and confusion that can occur without them \n\n## and the rigidity and boredom that can come with too much \n\n## structure and regimentation, where children are given no choice \n\n## and little flexibility. \n\n## As a parent, review the routines in your household to ensure \n\n## that they accomplish what you want. Here are some tips from \n\n## the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). \n\n## Weekday Mornings: \n\n## To make the household function well in the morning, everyone needs to know what has to be done to get ready for the \n\n## day. Try the following: \n\n## Put as many things in order as possible the night before. \n\n## Keep wake-up routines cheerful and positive. \n\n## Be sure your child eats breakfast, even if he or she is not hungry in the morning. See Breakfast for Learning \n\n## (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Breakfast-for-Learning.aspx). \n\n## Finally, round out each morning by saying goodbye to your young child. A simple hug and a wave as he or she \n\n## heads out the front door or slides out of the car are extremely important. They will give your child a positive \n\n## feeling with which to begin the day's activities.

For this age group, the \n\n## AAP recommends that a child come home to a parent, other adult, or a responsible adolescent. \n\n## Evenings: \n\n## Dinner should be an important time for your family. As often as possible, all family members should eat together at \n\n## the dinner table, without the distraction of television (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/Food-and-TV-Not-a-Healthy\n\n## Mix.aspx) or radio. During dinner the family can share the day's activities and participate in enjoyable conversation. \n\n## Everyone should be encouraged to take part, and negative comments and criticism should be discouraged. \n\n## Bedtime: \n\n## On school nights, children need a regular time to go to sleep. Lights can go out at different times for different children \n\n## in the family, depending on how much sleep each child needs. Nighttime rituals can help ease a child to sleep. These \n\n## rituals can include storytelling, reading aloud, conversation, and songs. Try to avoid exciting play and activities before \n\n## bedtime.

Throw in some special projects that require slow, controlled movements. For example, \n\n#### squeeze glitter glue over a line, fill in shapes with paint or use small, circular strokes to color an image. \n\n#### Tracing tactics. Let your child trace over your shapes in sand, or with chalk on a board before trying to draw the \n\n#### shapes on their own. Older kids can benefit from grid drawings to strengthen their visual motor skills. \n\n#### Work that core! Exercise the core muscles and shoulder muscles so that the hands and fingers will be able to \n\n#### move more freely and accurately. Climbing on playgrounds, for example, gives these muscles a good workout. \n\n#### Good posture is important when working on writing. \n\n#### Hand-eye coordination.

A potty-chair is a child-sized seat with an opening in the seat and a removable container \n\n### underneath to collect pee and poop. Children's feet should be able to reach the floor.

Know the signs. When your children feel the urge to poop, you might notice grunting, squatting, or freezing. \n\n### Children's faces may turn red while pooping. Explain briefly to your children that these signs mean a poop is \n\n### about to come. If your children tell you about a wet diaper, praise them for \"using their words.\" It may take longer \n\n### for children to notice the need to pee than the need to poop. \n\n### 5. Think of toilet training as toilet mastery. Invite your child to take over their toileting. Talk with them about \n\n### how they will now be in charge of their pee and poop.

Routines are important, and practicing the steps is helpful. Make a \n\n### habit of seating your children onto the potty-chair first thing in the morning.

Talk with your children about taking control and \n\n### toileting into the toilet and not their underwear. Some parents may use cloth training pants, which are a little \n\n### thicker, to protect children's clothing. (Diapers and disposable training pants send a message to children that \n\n### they are not taking over and do not need to learn to use the toilet.) \n\n### 9.

They should wipe thoroughly from front to back to prevent bringing germs from \n\n### their rectum to their vagina or bladder. Make sure both boys and girls learn to wash their hands well after using \n\n### the toilet. \n\n### 10. A word on praise. Taking over toileting is something all healthy children do.

Children at toilet training ages are becoming aware of their individuality. They look for \n\n### ways to test their limits. Some children may do so by holding back bowel movements.

Use your fingers to keep it from catching on his \n\n## or her face or ears. Don't try to push your baby's arm through \n\n## the sleeve. Instead, put your hand into the sleeve from the \n\n## outside, grasp your baby's hand, and pull it through. \n\n## When undressing your baby: Take off the sleeves one at a \n\n## time while you support your baby's back and head. Then \n\n## stretch the neckline, lifting it free of your baby's chin and face \n\n## as you gently slip it off. \n\n## Clothing Tips \n\n## In colder weather (under 75 degrees Fahrenheit [23.88 degrees Celsius]): Your baby will need several layers of \n\n## clothing to keep warm. It's generally best to dress your baby in an undershirt and diapers, covered by pajamas or \n\n## a dressing gown, and then wrap him or her in a receiving blanket. For an extra layer, a wearable blanket sleeper \n\n## or sleep sack is a safe alternative. \n\n## In hot weather (over 75 degrees Fahrenheit [23.88 degrees Celsius]): You can reduce your baby's clothing to a \n\n## single layer. A good rule of thumb is to dress the baby in one more layer of clothing than you are wearing to be \n\n## comfortable in the same environment. See Baby Sunburn Prevention (/English/ages-stages/baby/bathing-skin\n\n## care/Pages/Baby-Sunburn-Prevention.aspx) for more information. \n\n## If your baby is premature : He or she may need still another layer of clothing until his or her weight reaches \n\n## that of a full-term baby and his or her body is better able to adjust to changes in temperature. \n\n## If you've never taken care of a newborn baby before : The first few times you change a baby's clothes can be","metadata":{"id":1354}}],["1355",{"pageContent":"## If you've never taken care of a newborn baby before : The first few times you change a baby's clothes can be \n\n## quite frustrating.

Label the date the breast milk was expressed on each container and \n\n## include your child's name if you are giving the milk to a child care provider. Talk with your child care provider \n\n## about how they require breast milk be stored and labeled. \n\n## Store breast milk in small batches. 2 to 4 ounces is recommended to prevent waste. Any remaining breast milk \n\n## left in a bottle after your baby is finished with a feeding should be used within 2 hours, or, if quickly refrigerated, \n\n## used for the next feeding. You can always thaw an extra container if needed. \n\n## Refrigerate or chill milk right after it is expressed. Freshly expressed milk can remain at room temperature \n\n## (up to 77°F or 25°C) for 4 hours (or up to 6 to 8 hours if very cleanly expressed), but it is best to chill as soon as \n\n## possible. \n\n## Breast milk can be placed in the back of the refrigerator (39°F or 4°C). It is best to use refrigerated breast milk \n\n## within 4 days, but it can be refrigerated for up to 8 days. \n\n## To warm breast milk from the refrigerator: Place the bottle in a bowl of warm water or run it under warm \n\n## water. Microwaving breast milk is not safe due to the risk of scalding your baby with hot milk. \n\n## Freeze breast milk if you will not be using it within 24 hours. Breast milk expands as it freezes, so do not fill \n\n## the milk all the way to the top of the storage container. Again store the milk in the back of the freezer, not the \n\n## door. \n\n## If freezing the milk inside a refrigerator with a freezer that has a separate door (0°F or −18°C), milk may be \n\n## frozen for up to 9 months.","metadata":{"id":1358}}],["1359",{"pageContent":"## door. \n\n## If freezing the milk inside a refrigerator with a freezer that has a separate door (0°F or −18°C), milk may be \n\n## frozen for up to 9 months. \n\n## If the freezer is a chest or a deep freezer (−4°F or −20°C), milk may be frozen for up to 12 months. \n\n## To thaw breast milk from the freezer: Put the bottle or bag in the refrigerator overnight, hold it under warm \n\n## running water, or set it in a container of warm water.

She is now much more physically active (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/agesstages/baby/Pages/Movement-8-to-12-Months.aspx) and has more language expressions (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/agesstages/baby/Pages/Emotional-and-Social-Development-8-12Months.aspx) and emotional enthusiasm (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/agesstages/baby/Pages/Emotional-and-Social-Development-8-12Months.aspx). However, babies of this age also may experience stranger anxiety (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/Pages/Soothing-Your-ChildsSeparation-Anxiety.aspx), and could be reluctant to go to Grandma and Grandpa with much eagerness. Don't take this personally; it's part of normal development. Simply hang in there, and continue to provide all of the love and attention that you always have, but don't feel you must overdo it in the midst of these pulling-back episodes by the baby. Be patient, and the apparent standoffishness will resolve over time. \n\n## In your activities with your grandchild, you can take advantage of her \n\n## developmental progress in the following areas:","metadata":{"id":1361}}],["1362",{"pageContent":"Crawling. Get down on the floor with your grandchild as much as you physically can. This \"floor time\" is both fun and reassuring for the baby. She'll show delight if you use yourself as her crawling (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Crawling-Styles.aspx) target or object exploration. Remember, though, to check the floor carefully for possible hazards, since babies will pick up every object within reach and put it in their mouths. Fine Motor Skills. Develop your own set of fine motor \"games\" with your grandchild—for example, opening and closing items, dumping out and putting back games and toys (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/agesstages/baby/Pages/What-to-Look-for-in-a-Toy.aspx), and operating latches. Expect plenty of repetition since babies seem tireless doing the same activity over and over. Language. Read books (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/How-to-Share-Bookswith-Your-9-to-11-Month-Old.aspx) and listen to music with your grandchild. All the while, keep the language interactive. If you speak a language that's different from the one in which your grandchild is becoming proficient, don't be afraid to speak it to her. (Be sure her parents agree.) Basic Care. When it comes to feeding and sleeping, consistency of routines is important in this age group. Keep \"junior foods\" in your home. You also can establish \"Grandma's Special Menus\" that your grandchild can come to expect. When the baby is staying at your home (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/family-life/workplay/Pages/A-Message-for-Grandparents-Who-Provide-Childcare.aspx), nap times and nighttime sleep schedules should be maintained as close as possible to those at her own home. Changes of routine sometimes can create confusion for babies. Safety. Check items in your own home (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/athome/Pages/A-Message-for-Grandparents-Keeping-Your-Grandchild-Safe-in-Your-Home.aspx) to ensure your grandchild's well-being. Keep gates on the top and the bottom of stairways. Place soft, protective coverings around sharp or round edges. Don't use walkers (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/athome/Pages/Baby-Walkers-A-Dangerous-Choice.aspx). Also, since babies of this age can have a strong nature and are wiggly, changing diapers should be a two-person operation if possible; change the diapers on carpeted floors or sofas to minimize the risk that your grandchild will twist off the changing table (http://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/Changing-Table-Safety.aspx).

When introducing any new foods, the AAP recommends doing \n\n## so slowly and watching for any reactions. \n\n## Limit fruit juices. In 2012, similar questions were raised about arsenic in juice products.

The following are some of the most common causes: \n\n## Large Babies: An infant can be born large when the parents are large or the mother is \n\n## overweight. There is also a greater likelihood of a large newborn due to factors such as: \n\n## The pregnancy lasting longer than forty-two weeks \n\n## The fetus’s growth over stimulated in the uterus \n\n## Fetal chromosomal abnormalities \n\n## Weight gain during pregnancy \n\n## The mother’s ethnicity \n\n## The mother having diabetes before or during pregnancy \n\n## The mother having given birth to other children \n\n## Having a boy \n\n## Large infants may have metabolic abnormalities (such as low blood sugar and calcium), traumatic birth injuries, \n\n## higher hemoglobin levels, jaundice, or various congenital abnormalities. Almost one-third of large babies initially \n\n## have feeding difficulties.

They are followed by body mass index for age charts for boys and girls, ages two to \n\n## twenty years. (Body mass index, or BMI, is a measure of weight in relation to height.) \n\n## Eighty out of every one hundred babies born at forty weeks of pregnancy, or full term, weigh between 5 pounds 11-1⁄2 \n\n## ounces (2.6 kg) and 8 pounds 5-3⁄4 ounces (3.8 kg).

This new fullness may feel \n\n## uncomfortable at first and may make it more difficult for your baby to latch on to the breast correctly. With practice, \n\n## however (and perhaps with the help of your baby’s pediatrician or lactation specialist), you will help your baby latch \n\n## on. \n\n## Sometimes expressing a small amount of milk by hand will help to soften the areola enough to make it easier for the \n\n## baby to latch. The drops of milk on your nipple also will encourage your baby to feed. Breastfeeding will ease the \n\n## pressure in your breasts and make you feel more comfortable. \n\n## As your baby latches on and begins to breastfeed steadily, you may notice a tingly pins-and-needles sensation. This \n\n## feeling tells you that the milk let-down reflex has occurred, causing milk to be pushed out of the milk-producing cells \n\n## into milk ducts so it’s available to your baby. The let-down reflex can be stimulated by your baby’s suckling, an \n\n## approaching feeding time, or just the sound ofyour baby’s hungry cry. Once this happens, your milk will flow more \n\n## plentifully and your baby will enjoy a satisfying feeding. You will hear him swallowing more frequently.

This is yet another result of the hormone oxytocin. It is important for you to try to relax and rest, as stress, \n\n## pain, and fatigue may decrease milk production and release. \n\n## The combination of sharply increased demand and the resulting increased human milk supply may make you feel \n\n## like you are constantly breastfeeding during this early period. Daytime feedings may be anywhere from one and a half \n\n## to three hours apart and may range in length from ten minutes to close to an hour each. Human milk is easily \n\n## digested by the baby, and breastfed newborns typically nurse eight to twelve times a day.

Over time, feedings will continue to change in frequency \n\n## and length, depending upon your baby’s needs. \n\n## Mature Milk \n\n## In most women, mature milk begins to appear near the end of the second week after childbirth. Mature milk is \n\n## produced in as great a volume as transitional milk but is thinner and more watery or even bluish; sometimes it’s \n\n## described as looking like skim milk when it is first secreted, until the fat is released later in the feeding and it becomes \n\n## more creamy. \n\n## Your breasts may appear somewhat softer and smaller than they did during the transitional-milk stage, though they \n\n## will still be larger than before your pregnancy.

Probably not. You should relate to and treat each youngster differently. Treating each child as an individual is part of what makes that child a unique person and is a way of appreciating his special characteristics. A husband and wife become and learn how to be parents with their first child, who for a while is their only child. As a result, their relationship with that first child will be different from their relationships with subsequent children. Since parents develop and learn along with their children, parents' actions, conversational style, and displays of emotion will change with each new youngster. Not only do parents change their style as they gain experience raising children, but each youngster has his or her own style and needs, initially because of birth order and inborn traits, and later because of experiences. Older children need to be treated differently from younger ones. High-strung children need different approaches than do easygoing ones. On every issue—rules, expectations, chores, responsibilities, rewards, and punishment—parents must individualize their parenting while trying to remain fair to all. This last goal is nearly impossible to achieve. Even if parents interact with their youngsters in a comparable manner, each child may perceive these actions differently. Your behavior toward your children is determined in part by the age and developmental stage of each youngster. For example, you probably have tended to treat all your children in a somewhat similar way at the same age or level of development. A mother may be physically affectionate to her two children in their respective toddler years but less visibly affectionate when they reach school age. In a situation like this, the older child may perceive that the younger sibling is receiving more affection. Parents should treat children differently at different ages; problems occur when parents are not able to act appropriately for their child's developmental age and needs. Birth order and family size also influence your children's development. The experience of an only child is different from that of a child in a larger family. An older child's experience is different from a younger one's: The older child has a younger sibling, while the younger child has an older sibling. A third child has two older siblings, and so on. Because of birth order and family size, no two children experience the same family the same way. The birth order of your children also will affect the way you relate to them, the way they respond, the experiences they have, and thus the way they develop as individuals. For instance, firstborn children may feel neglected or unloved after the arrival of a new sibling. Though their parents may expect or at least hope for them to be more responsible and self-sufficient, firstborns may act younger or more babylike in order to attract parental attention. In turn, the parents may express frustration or anger with them because of their babyish behavior. The temperaments of each parent and each child influence the way each interacts with the other. A parent whose temperament fares best with order and predictability could find raising a disorganized, spontaneous, impulsive child a daily challenge. On the other hand, easygoing parents and children can readily make allowances for one another. Each pair of family members has a unique relationship. A child relates in different ways to his father and to his mother. His sibling relates to each parent in his or her own way. Each sibling relates to each brother or sister in a particular way. Children are quite sensitive to these differences within family relationships; they monitor them, respond to them, and relate to one another in a manner based upon the nature of their experiences and how they perceive them. Therefore, some of the differences among siblings reflect how they perceive their roles and relationships within their families—how they have been loved, appreciated, respected, and understood. These factors can influence their selfconfidence, sense of trust, and ability to cope with challenges and disappointments. Over the years the relationships among siblings can contribute to increasing differences. Siblings compete for the affection and attention of their parents; they may compare themselves with one another, become aware of one another's strengths and weaknesses, and try to find the most comfortable and rewarding role for themselves within the family unit. In this dynamic interaction, differences develop and can become more pronounced with time, affecting everything from self-esteem and behavioral style to life goals and career choices.

In fact, the medicine may be harmful to newborns. \n\n## Antibiotics for babies without infections. \n\n## When newborns are at risk for infection, doctors may give them antibiotics right away, before they know if the baby \n\n## has an infection. Doctors do this because blood test results can take 2 days, and it is better to be safe. \n\n## The problem is that some babies get antibiotics for too long, even though blood tests are negative and the baby has \n\n## remained well.

The earlier you start, the \n\n## more likely your baby will accept the stomach as a natural position. In fact, before the umbilical \n\n## cord (/English/ages-stages/baby/bathing-skin-care/Pages/Umbilical-Cord-Care.aspx) has fallen \n\n## off, you can position your newborn on your stomach or chest while you are awake and in a reclined position on a chair, \n\n## bed, or floor ( with a pillow to support your head), tummy to tummy with baby. \n\n## Take this perfect opportunity to socialize with your newborn and encourage lots of eye contact. Talk in animated tones \n\n## and use exaggerated expressions to get her to look at you. It’s a special time to bond tummy to tummy. \n\n## Activity #2: Lap Time \n\n## You can also position your baby tummy down across your lap lengthwise while providing head support. Remember to \n\n## keep her head aligned with her body. If she falls asleep in that position, just transfer her to the bed ( but place her down \n\n## to sleep on her back (/English/ages-stages/baby/sleep/Pages/Back-to-Sleep-Tummy-to-Play.aspx)). For more \n\n## stimulation, slowly raise and lower your legs at the same time, then move them slowly from side to side.

But after your kids log off from school and homework (/English/health-issues/conditions/COVID-19/Pages/Working-and-Learning-from-Home-COVID-19.aspx) for the day, is it okay if they spend a few hours gaming with their friends? When video game lives replace real-life time with family and friends, is it a sign of addiction? \n\nLet's explore why video games are so appealing to kids and what parents can do to keep gaming in check. \n\n## Gaming problems: who's at risk? \n\nPlaying video games is a fun and normal part of teenage life. But there's a small number of kids who have a hard time controlling the time they spend gaming. \n\nResearchers are studying this and learning more (http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000939) about who is at risk and why. During a 6-year study, they noticed that about 10% of adolescents had symptoms of unhealthy gaming that got worse over time. These kids seem to have a few things in common. \n\n They are more likely to be boys. \n\n They play video games at the expense of homework, sleep, exercise or relationships with family and friends. \n\n They may have depression (/English/health-issues/conditions/COVID-19/Pages/Signs-your-Teen-May-NeedMore-Support.aspx), anxiety, shyness, aggression, and problems with too much cell phone use.

It is a prescription therapy and does not replace other ADHD therapy, medication, or educational programs directed by your doctor. \n\n The game-based digital device helped improve attention, according to 5 studies of more than 600 children.

Staying on top of how much your children use all forms of media (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/Tips-for-Parents-Digital-Age.aspx) can help. Here's how. \n\n Have a family media plan. Use our media plan tool (/English/media/Pages/default.aspx) to help you map out your child's media diet. Think carefully about what activities the video games might be displacing.

They also might collect your child's personal information (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/5-Unhealthy-Ways-Digital-Ads-May-Be-Targeting-YourChild.aspx). \n\n Keep gaming in common areas. This isn't always possible, of course. Teens go off to their rooms with their phones and do schoolwork on their laptops. It's nearly impossible to keep track of everything they do. But to the extent that it is possible, try to keep the activity where everyone can see. \n\n Play games along with them and set a good example. Not only does this help you see what they are doing and how they are doing it, but it can help put some time limits on gaming. \n\n Focus on real-world games for younger children. Young children learn a lot when they connect with other people. (https://developingchild.harvard.edu/science/key-concepts/serve-and-return/) Encourage them to play (/English/ages-stages/toddler/fitness/Pages/Caution-Children-at-Play.aspx) with toys, books and crayons. \n\nSet a good example and seek help if you need it. Parents who are hooked on gaming may be more prone to depression. Distracted parents often miss clues that their child needs attention and respond more harshly. If you are struggling to limit how much time you spend playing video games, know that it's okay to get help (https://www.samhsa.gov/findhelp/national-helpline).

Breastfeeding \n\n## sessions that are consistently briefer than about ten minutes during the first few months \n\n## may mean that your baby isn’t getting enough milk and that not enough milk is being removed to stimulate your \n\n## ongoing milk production. Sessions that last consistently longer than about fifty minutes may mean that your \n\n## baby isn’t receiving enough milk due to ineffective suckling or low milk production. \n\n## Your baby still seems hungry after most feedings. She may not be ingesting enough milk. Consult your \n\n## pediatrician and have her weighed right away. Meanwhile, double-check her latch-on and position at the breast \n\n## to try to increase the milk she is getting. \n\n## Your newborn frequently misses nursing sessions or sleeps through the night. Frequent feedings around \n\n## the clock are a necessary part of breastfeeding a new baby. Your baby requires a feeding every few hours to gain \n\n## sufficient weight to thrive.

When the health care team becomes aware of these signs, your baby may have blood work, a spinal tap, a \n\n## urine culture, or x-rays to identify the cause of infection.

If your baby develops a hernia, most eventually require surgical repair. \n\n\n## Inguinal Hernia \n\n### The most common hernia is called an inguinal hernia. This condition occurs most often in males and usually presents \n\n#### as a bulge in the groin, especially after crying or straining during a bowel movement. Sometimes girls get inguinal \n\n#### hernias, which cause a bulge, or swelling, above or along the labia. Usually a boy’s testicles stay in the inguinal canal \n\n#### (high in the groin, not down in the scrotal sac) until about 32 weeks’ gestation. At that time, the testicles descend into \n\n#### the scrotum. But in preterm babies, part of the intestine may push through a remaining gap in the muscle wall into the \n\n#### scrotum. This may affect one or both sides and appears as a swelling above or in the scrotum. As long as the hernia is \n\n#### reducible (the intestine can be easily and gently pushed back through the opening), immediate surgical correction is \n\n#### not necessary.

Reflux may be \n\n#### caused by respiratory distress that causes the diaphragm and abdominal muscles to work harder than they should, \n\n#### positioning an infant on her back, bearing down with abdominal muscles during movement, and large volumes of food \n\n#### causing pressure on the junction at the esophagus and stomach.

Rapid growth also causes a decrease in blood counts. Babies often cannot replenish their blood \n\n#### supply fast enough to keep up with the necessary blood tests in the NICU; therefore, blood transfusions may be given \n\n#### to correct anemia. In some institutions, the medication Epogen (EPO) is given to help stimulate RBC production. \n\n#### Anemia can cause low oxygen and glucose levels in the blood, which can cause the tissues and organs to function \n\n#### improperly. Infants with anemia may appear pale and lethargic, have an increase in apnea and/or bradycardia, and not \n\n#### eat well. Infants on respiratory support may have regular transfusions.

In this way, you and your child will \n\n### have time to find other ways to maintain closeness, express and accept tenderness or comfort, and ensure proper \n\n### nutritional intake before you completely stop nursing.

The easiest first session to skip in this way is usually the midday \n\n### breastfeeding, when your child may already have had access to a lunch of solid food and such liquids as cow's milk or \n\n### water. \n\n### If your child gets used to missing the midday nursing session, take a look at skipping a second feeding in the same \n\n### way.

Most new teenaged caregivers (/English/agesstages/teen/Pages/Babysitting-Jobs.aspx) and those new to the household need more details than extended-family members and the usual caregivers do. Parents may need to be tactful with older family members (/English/family-life/work-play/pages/A-Message-for-Grandparents-WhoProvide-Childcare.aspx), as the practices they are comfortable with do not necessarily suit a new generation. \n\n If you are leaving a picky eater (/English/ages-stages/toddler/nutrition/Pages/Picky-Eaters.aspx) in the care of a caregiver, pass on any necessary information out of the child’s hearing and avoid giving overly detailed instructions. Many picky eaters will eat without a fuss when sharing a meal with other children or caregivers.

By this time the 2 sides of the brain are on good terms with \n\n#### each other. Until this point the eyes track together as long as they both have something to look at, but if one is \n\n#### deprived of input (from being covered by a hat, for example), it might drift off in its own direction. By 6 months of age \n\n#### the eyes should continue looking the same direction even if one of them is covered temporarily. We test this in the \n\n#### clinic by covering 1 eye for 3 seconds, then suddenly uncovering it and looking to see if it’s still tracking with the \n\n#### opposite eye. We call this test the cover-uncover test. \n\n#### Sometimes the shape of a child’s face makes it look as though the eyes are crossed even when they are not. A child \n\n#### with a broad nasal bridge may appear to have an inward-looking eye, when in fact he’s just looking off to the side. You \n\n#### can check this by watching the light reflection in your child’s eyes from a window or lamp; if it falls in the same place \n\n#### on each eye, the eyes are working together. \n\n## Lazy eye (amblyophobia) \n\n#### Even with office screening, however, we don’t always catch an eye that tends to deviate. Deviations occur more often \n\n#### when the child is tired. If you ever notice that your 6-month-old or older child has an eye that doesn’t always look the \n\n#### same way as its partner, alert his doctor. It’s critical that an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) (/English/family\n\n#### life/health-management/pediatric-specialists/Pages/What-is-a-Pediatric-Ophthalmologist.aspx) examine the child. \n\n#### What some people call a lazy eye (amblyopia) (/English/health-issues/conditions/eyes/Pages/Amblyopia-Lazy","metadata":{"id":1481}}],["1482",{"pageContent":"#### What some people call a lazy eye (amblyopia) (/English/health-issues/conditions/eyes/Pages/Amblyopia-Lazy\n\n#### Eye.aspx) may be a sign that one eye doesn’t see as clearly as the other. When the brain is forced to make 1 picture \n\n#### from 2 very different inputs, it starts to ignore the signals from the worse eye. Over time this process becomes \n\n#### irreversible, leading to partial blindness in the weaker eye. In most cases, you should address the problem before the \n\n#### child turns 3 to ensure he’ll grow up with normal depth perception. Treatments for amblyopia vary based on the cause \n\n#### and severity of the condition.

As children grow, friendships take on new meaning. Parents who have open communication and active involvement in the early years set the tone for ongoing deeper conversations about friends during the school-aged and adolescent years. \n\n## The early years \n\n Starting from the preschool years (/english/agesstages/preschool/Pages/default.aspx), you can be present and available when your children are playing with others. You can provide instruction about sharing and resolving conflicts without hitting or demeaning friends. These early play times allow you to see how your child interacts with other children and highlights your child's internal social strengths and challenges (/English/ages-stages/preschool/Pages/Social-Development-inPreschoolers.aspx). If your child is very shy (/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/Shyness-in-Children.aspx), you will be able to help warm up initial interactions and, conversely, if your child is very social, you will be able to help him learn how to make room for a quieter friend. \n\n Even from the very start, children get very angry (/English/healthy-living/emotional-wellness/Pages/EverybodyGets-Mad-Helping-Your-Child-Cope-with-Conflict.aspx) with friends. This gives you the opportunity to teach how to feel the emotional and physical sensation of anger and express anger without verbally or physically hurting others. It is also key to remember that anger is temporary. Your child needs to learn not to ruin a relationship out of momentary anger or frustration; the moment will pass. \n\n## The school-aged years \n\n### Adults often think \"children need to work it out themselves.\" Sometimes they do. But rarely do people learn the \n\n fine art of friendship without some support or role-modeling about healthy friendships.","metadata":{"id":1489}}],["1490",{"pageContent":"fine art of friendship without some support or role-modeling about healthy friendships. \n\n Children with different social skills will require different coaching about friendships. \n\n The shy child will need to learn to not respond to peer conflict with fear, worry, and increased isolation. \n\n The child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (/English/healthissues/conditions/adhd/Pages/Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity-Disorder.aspx) will need to be coached to slow down or filter their thoughts so that they can give their friend \"a break\" before being too direct or harsh. \n\n A very physically active child will have to be sure to avoid hurting friends when filled with frustration and anger. \n\n Children who have grown up in a home where a lot of anger is expressed or children who have experienced or witnessed physical violence at home (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/What-to-Know-aboutChild-Abuse.aspx) will need specific skills to slow down their physical and verbal response to a threat. \n\n Welcome your child's friends to your home. Be sure that they can follow the rules of your home. If speaking with respect and asking permission to have a snack (/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Choosing-HealthySnacks.aspx) is a core value in your family, be sure that your child's friends can accept and accommodate these rules. If a friend is difficult for you to manage, this will give you good information about what your child is coping with and whether you need to be involved in supporting or redirecting this friendship choice.","metadata":{"id":1490}}],["1491",{"pageContent":"If there is any chance that you can join your child's school (/English/agesstages/gradeschool/school/Pages/How-to-Get-Involved-With-Your-Childs-School.aspx), sport, or club event, get involved. Some preteens may ask that your involvement not \"embarrass them,\" but still be present. In these settings, preteens may ignore you and almost forget you are there. You will get the chance to see your child in action and appreciate how they get along with their peers. \n\n Be sure that you, as a parent, are involved in creating social plans. There is no reason to encourage texting or phone use (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/cell-phones-whats-the-right-age-to-start.aspx) before a child needs it to keep in contact with you. Once she is able to remotely communicate with peers, be sure you know who she is communicating with, how much time she is in communication, and the nature of what she is communicating \n\n### about. Devices should be put away when the family is hanging out (parents included). \n\n Though friends are important, emphasize early that so too is family time (/English/family-life/familydynamics/Pages/Quality-Family-Time.aspx). \n\n Some children will identify a best friend (/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/Friend-or-Foe.aspx). This can be very helpful, as the duo can take on new challenges and bounce ideas off one another. Knowing your child's best friend's family can be helpful. You can help your child decide when the friendship is supporting her to take on new developmental challenges and when one or the other child might feel burdened by being a best friend to the exclusion of others. Early best friends allow you to start the dialogue about the lifelong challenge of balancing time with close friends, groups of friends, and family.","metadata":{"id":1491}}],["1492",{"pageContent":"Remember that peer relationships are the most important relationships, beyond the family, to teach children empathy. You can help your child identify how she feels when a friendship creates a disappointment. You can help her identify her own emotions, such as feeling rejected, angry, hurt, or sad, and then pay attention to the larger social interaction. This can allow her to empathize with her friend rather than just feel her own emotion. Guide her to learn that she should act only after her own emotions have been identified and she has considered her friend's emotions or motives. \n\n Friendships offer the opportunity to learn about talking and listening. Children and adults need to learn that when you talk to a friend, that friend needs to be able just to listen. This is an ideal point to role-model. \n\n Parents can use friendships to drive home essential points about resilience (/English/healthy-living/emotionalwellness/Pages/Building-Resilience-in-Children.aspx). When a child chooses to talk to a friend about a concern, issue, or anything that made them upset, it is a sign they are a good friend. Figuring out how to communicate well with other people can be a significant source of strength. \n\n Teach that working through things with a friend is smart—you can avoid a fight (which usually only leads to more fighting anyway), save face because you took on (for boys, \"manned up\" to) the problem and, most importantly, preserved meaningful friendships. Teaching children to preserve friendships with all their ups and downs is a tremendous skill that will bring lifelong stability in all personal relationships, including romantic ones. \n\n When a good friend moves away (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/Pages/Helping-Children-Adjust-to-aMove.aspx), this is a significant loss. But it also gives your child a chance to maintain a friendship over a distance. These friendships can provide a respite from school or sport friendships that have to deal with day-to-day hassles.","metadata":{"id":1492}}],["1493",{"pageContent":"## The adolescent years \n\n Many risks that teens take on are proxy markers of maturity—signals that teens send to others that they are ready to be seen as a young adult. This is when you worry about negative peer influences (/English/agesstages/teen/substance-abuse/Pages/Helping-Teens-Resist-Pressure-to-Try-Drugs.aspx). It is true that most of the major health risks in life are started during adolescence and in the presence of peers—cigarette smoking, alcohol use, exposure to sexually transmitted infections, and possibly even obesity. It is understandable and important for you to have concerns about the potentially negative aspects of peer influence. However, it is also important for you to remember that peer influence can also be protective and peer support can be invaluable. \n\n Children at different ages require more support. First it is important to know when your child is most vulnerable. Younger adolescents are most apt to conform to perceived group opinions and more likely to question their own opinion than even younger children or older peers. Your child may pass through this stage at age 11 to 13 or 13 to 15, and some late bloomers will be more vulnerable later. Knowing how your child is maturing in relation to their peers is important. \n\n Back to Top \n\n\n In middle school, friends and friendships can seem to change. A friend who always loved to play with dolls will decide that such play is immature and want to be on her iPad texting (/English/family-life/Media/Pages/How-toMake-a-Family-Media-Use-Plan.aspx) others.

For example, if your child is a popular student they may be a bit more adept socially than their peers, look or act a bit older, and can be influential. This can all be quite positive. But, they sometimes are aware that they have to try to act older than their peers to keep their popularity up. This can be a risk for them. As teens reach high school (/English/ages-stages/teen/school/Pages/Making-Friends-in-High-School.aspx), friends get involved in different activities and friendship groups can become more diverse, but close friends might be better matched than in the earlier years. Some friends who have a new boyfriend or girlfriend will seem to just disappear. \n\n Teens develop social skills by hanging out with their peers. How to meet new people, converse in a group, make small talk, be teased and gently tease back, and generally share funny stories or jokes is one of the most important parts of friendship. Later in life, good friends will meet after a long break and often say it feels as comfortable to talk as when they first met in their teen or young adult years. In part, that is because they quickly get to the core of who the other person is, have a shared past, and often laugh at the same type of humor. Learning how to share your sense of humor with friends is critically important for social development because it can offset conflicts, mitigate criticism, and make life in general more fun. \n\n Encourage your teen to talk about all kinds of things with their peers. In conversations with peers, teens can have a back-and-forth discussion that feels more mutual than with adults who may have \"already made up their mind\" and inadvertently do not allow the teen to explore a range of ideas. Peers can be protective of your teen.","metadata":{"id":1494}}],["1495",{"pageContent":"Having a caring adult who is adept and \"friended\" without limits on your teen's social network (/English/familylife/Media/Pages/Talking-to-Kids-and-Tweens-About-Social-Media.aspx) page is important. It ensures that you \"know\" to some degree the feel, humor, and different types of people that your child connects with. \n\n Rather than blaming a teen who is vulnerable to peer pressure for \"not being able to stand up\" to others, it can be helpful to know that you will need to rely on \"face-saving\" strategies to help your child stay safe. This will better allow your child to be different from peers. Parents deciding that a preteen cannot go on a sleepover to a home with poor adult supervision makes the parent look like \"a huge pain,\" but the preteen is spared potentially difficult decisions at the sleepover that he was not ready to face. \n\n One of the best things you can do to support good behaviors (/English/family-life/familydynamics/Pages/Positive-Parenting-How-To-Encourage-Good-Behavior.aspx) is to connect with the parents of \n\n### your teen's friends. Remember that one of the fundamental questions for adolescents is, \"Am I normal?\" and \n\n sometimes they will make unwise decisions to prove they are normal. If they are given clearer or stricter boundaries than their friends, they may feel as if they are being treated unfairly and rebel as a result. On the other hand, when parents work together to create common expectations, your teens do not feel like they are being treated differently and will more comfortably comply with the rules. \n\n**Last Updated** 4/7/2022 **Source** American Academy of Pediatrics (Copyright © 2014) The information contained on this Web site should not be used as a substitute for the medical care and advice of your pediatrician.

It can be hard to think about your child being sick or hurt badly enough to need emergency medical services (EMS), but these things do happen. \n\nBe prepared in case you ever need to call 911 and know what to expect when you do; this can help rescue crews get there as quickly as possible to help. \n\n## 911: 3 digits, many systems \n\nThere are different types of EMS systems depending on where you live. Some are combined with the fire department. Ambulances and other emergency transport teams may work through either public or private services. \n\n## What's your emergency? \n\n#### When you call 911, the dispatch operator will ask you a series of important questions that usually begin with, \"What's \n\n#### your emergency?\" \n\n Be calm. Try to be patient as you answer questions about your child's condition and medical history. The questions allow 911 responders to send the right type of EMS providers and transportation. Know that as operators are gathering information, they are sending it to the dispatcher in real time. \n\n Know your location. Calls from a land line usually show the dispatch center the exact address of the place you are calling from. However, at least 70% of 911 calls now come from cell phones (https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/911-wireless-services). Since many areas of the country do not yet have the enhanced 911 technology needed for EMS systems to pinpoint the exact location of mobile phone callers, the operator may need your help to find you. If you are in an unfamiliar place, like when traveling, try to take note of the address, nearby streets, or landmarks, and be ready to give the 911 operator as many details as possible.","metadata":{"id":1496}}],["1497",{"pageContent":"Stay on the line.

The operator may want to walk you through giving first-aid (/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/First-Aid-Guide.aspx) or CPR (/English/news/Pages/AAPAdvocates-for-Life-Support-Training-Children-Adults.aspx) if necessary, or tell you if you should move to a safer location until help arrives. \n\n If you get disconnected : If calling 911 from a cell phone, provide your wireless number so the operator can call back if the call drops. \n\n## Types of EMS providers \n\nWhen you call 911, there are different levels of providers who come to your aid. These include: \n\n First responders , usually firefighters or police officers, can give basic first-aid care and CPR for adults, children and infants. \n\n Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) can do a little more than first responders. They may be able to assist in giving a patient's own epinephrine autoinjector (/English/health-issues/injuries-emergencies/Pages/How-toUse-an-Epinephrine-Auto-Injector.aspx) for a severe allergic reaction, for example, or help patients use their own \n\n\n inhaler (/English/health-issues/conditions/allergies-asthma/Pages/Asthma-Inhalers.aspx) for an asthma attacks. They can also help patients who may have trouble breathing with oxygen and equipment called a bag valve mask. Paramedics have higher-level training to give certain life-saving medications through intravenous (IV) catheters in a vein, with an injection (shot), or by mouth. Paramedics can also place breathing tubes to help people having trouble breathing, for example, and use defibrillators (/English/health-issues/injuriesemergencies/Pages/Using-an-AED.aspx) to restart the heart with electricity. \n\n## Which hospital will the ambulance go to?","metadata":{"id":1497}}],["1498",{"pageContent":"## Which hospital will the ambulance go to? \n\nDepending on your location and situation, parents may be able to choose which hospital the rescue crew transports their child to for treatment in the emergency department (/English/health-issues/injuries-emergencies/Pages/10Things-for-Parents-to-Know-Before-Heading-to-the-ER.aspx). However, EMS systems often have regional and specialty hospitals that are designated for different types of illnesses and injuries. These include pediatric trauma centers (/English/news/Pages/AAP-Offers-Recommendations-to-Improve-Caring-for-Pediatric-Trauma.aspx) or children's hospitals equipped with the resources and staff available for a child's specific treatment needs. Small babies, for example, may need to go to hospitals specializing in infant care. Sometimes, this may not be the closest hospital to your location. \n\n### Future improvements to 911 \n\n EMS answering centers across the United States are transitioning to upgraded digital technology known as Next Generation 911 (https://www.911.gov/ng911movie.html). Eventually, this will allow families to text or even send photos and video to 911. Texting during an emergency could be helpful when it's available if you are unable to hear well or talk without putting yourself in danger. But if you are able to make a voice call to 911, and if it is safe to do so, the Federal Communications Commission (https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/text-911-quick-facts-faqs) advises that you should always make a voice call to 911. \n\n## EMS during the COVID-19 pandemic \n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic EMS staff will likely arrive wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect themselves and the community at large from spreading the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

This feeling that he can successfully meet a challenge will add to his confidence in other areas of his \n\n## life, including social and academic pursuits.

You and your partner may also learn to recognize the signs indicating when one of \n\n### you reaches his or her limit, requiring quick intervention from the other. Finally, you may notice that one of you may \n\n### be more inclined to “do” for your child, while the other is more likely to help her to be as independent as possible—a \n\n### pattern that may continue for years. \n\n### Though you will find that many of these created patterns will continue throughout childhood, others will change \n\n### many times over the years: Your child may turn to one parent more than the other for a few years, then switch \n\n### parents; she may imitate one of you at one stage of her life, the other at another stage, and then switch back again; she \n\n### may prefer one of you as her confidant, the other as her playmate. The main thing to remember is that she will have \n\n### separate relationships with both of her parents, and this is all part of growing up and becoming herself. \n\n### However, you can use what you observe about your patterns as a family to make whatever changes you think are \n\n### necessary.

It's a job \n\n## that takes time and patience. But, it helps to learn the effective and \n\n## healthy discipline strategies. \n\n## Here are some tips from the American Academy of Pediatrics \n\n## (AAP) on the best ways to help your child learn acceptable \n\n## behavior as they grow. \n\n## 10 healthy discipline strategies that \n\n## work \n\n## The AAP recommends positive discipline strategies that effectively \n\n## teach children to manage their behavior and keep them from harm while promoting healthy development. These \n\n## include: \n\n## 1. Show and tell. Teach children right from wrong with calm words and actions. Model behaviors you would like to \n\n## see in your children. \n\n## 2. Set limits. Have clear and consistent rules your children can follow. Be sure to explain these rules in age\n\n## appropriate terms they can understand. \n\n## 3. Give consequences. Calmly and firmly explain the consequences if they don't behave. For example, tell her that \n\n## if she does not pick up her toys, you will put them away for the rest of the day. Be prepared to follow through right \n\n## away. Don't give in by giving them back after a few minutes. But remember, never take away something your \n\n## child truly needs, such as a meal. \n\n## 4. Hear them out. Listening is important. Let your child finish the story before helping solve the problem. Watch \n\n## for times when misbehavior has a pattern, like if your child is feeling jealous. Talk with your child about this \n\n## rather than just giving consequences. \n\n## 5. Give them your attention. The most powerful tool for effective discipline is attention—to reinforce good \n\n## behaviors and discourage others. Remember, all children want their parent's attention. \n\n## 6. Catch them being good. Children need to know when they do something bad--and when they do something \n\n## good. Notice good behavior and point it out, praising success and good tries. Be specific (for example, \"Wow, you","metadata":{"id":1506}}],["1507",{"pageContent":"## good. Notice good behavior and point it out, praising success and good tries. Be specific (for example, \"Wow, you \n\n## did a good job putting that toy away!\"). \n\n## 7. Know when not to respond. As long as your child isn't doing something dangerous and gets plenty of attention \n\n## for good behavior, ignoring bad behavior can be an effective way of stopping it. Ignoring bad behavior can also \n\n## teach children natural consequences of their actions. For example, if your child keeps dropping her cookies on \n\n## purpose, she will soon have no more cookies left to eat. If she throws and breaks her toy, she will not be able to \n\n## play with it. It will not be long before she learns not to drop her cookies and to play carefully with her toys. \n\n## 8. Be prepared for trouble. Plan ahead for situations when your child might have trouble behaving. Prepare them \n\n## for upcoming activities and how you want them to behave. \n\n## 9. Redirect bad behavior. Sometimes children misbehave because they are bored or don't know any better. Find \n\n## something else for your child to do. \n\n## 10. Call a time-out. A time-out (/English/family-life/family-dynamics/communication-discipline/Pages/Time-Outs\n\n## 101.aspx) can be especially useful when a specific rule is broken. This discipline tool works best by warning \n\n## children they will get a time out if they don't stop, reminding them what they did wrong in as few words―and \n\n## with as little emotion―as possible, and removing them from the situation for a pre-set length of time (1 minute \n\n## per year of age is a good rule of thumb). With children who are at least 3 years old, you can try letting their \n\n\n#### children lead their own time-out instead of setting a timer. You can just say, \"Go to time out and come back when \n\n#### you feel ready and in control.\" This strategy, which can help the child learn and practice self-management skills, \n\n##### also works well for older children and teens. \n\n## Learn from mistakes—including your own","metadata":{"id":1507}}],["1508",{"pageContent":"##### also works well for older children and teens. \n\n## Learn from mistakes—including your own \n\n##### Remember that, as a parent, you can give yourself a time out if you feel out of control.

When you are feeling \n\n##### better, go back to your child, hug each other, and start over. \n\n##### If you do not handle a situation well the first time, try not to worry about it.

If you feel you have made a real mistake in the heat of the moment, wait to \n\n##### cool down, apologize to your child, and explain how you will handle the situation in the future. Be sure to keep your \n\n##### promise. This gives your child a good model of how to recover from mistakes. \n\n### Spanking and harsh words are harmful and don't work. Here's why: \n\n##### The AAP policy statement, \" Effective Discipline to Raise Healthy Children (https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2018\n\n##### 3112) ,\" highlights why it's important to focus on teaching good behavior rather than punishing bad behavior. \n\n##### Research shows that spanking, slapping and other forms of physical punishment don't work well to correct a \n\n##### child's behavior. The same holds true for yelling at or shaming a child. Beyond being ineffective, harsh physical \n\n##### and verbal punishments can also damage a child's long-term physical and mental health. \n\n##### Spanking's unhealthy cycle. The AAP advises that parents and caregivers should not spank or hit children. \n\n##### Instead of teaching responsibility and self-control, spanking often increases aggression and anger in \n\n##### children. A study (http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2013/10/16/peds.2013-1227) of \n\n##### children born in 20 large U.S. cities found that families who used physical punishment got caught in a","metadata":{"id":1508}}],["1509",{"pageContent":"##### children born in 20 large U.S. cities found that families who used physical punishment got caught in a \n\n##### negative cycle: the more children were spanked, the more they later misbehaved, which prompted more \n\n##### spankings in response.

Children who are \n\n##### spanked may be more likely to hit others when they don't get what they want. \n\n##### Lasting marks. Physical punishment increases the risk of injury, especially in children under 18 months of \n\n##### age, and may leave other measurable marks on the brain and body. Children who are spanked show higher \n\n##### levels of hormones tied to toxic stress (https://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health\n\n##### initiatives/resilience/Pages/ACEs-and-Toxic-Stress.aspx). Physical punishment may also affect brain \n\n##### development. One study found that young adults who were spanked repeatedly had less gray matter, the part \n\n##### of the brain involved with self-control, and performed lower on IQ tests as young adults than the control \n\n##### group. \n\n##### Verbal abuse: How words hurt. Yelling at children and using words to cause emotional pain or shame also \n\n##### has been found to be ineffective and harmful. Harsh verbal discipline, even by parents who are otherwise \n\n##### warm and loving, can lead to more misbehavior and mental health problems in children. Research \n\n##### (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3875601/) shows that harsh verbal discipline, which \n\n##### becomes more common as children get older, may lead to more behavior problems and symptoms of \n\n##### depression in teens. \n\n###### Back to Top \n\n\n## Healthy & effective discipline tips by age/stage \n\nInfants (^) Babies learn by watching what you do, so set examples of behavior you expect.","metadata":{"id":1509}}],["1510",{"pageContent":"##### depression in teens. \n\n###### Back to Top \n\n\n## Healthy & effective discipline tips by age/stage \n\nInfants (^) Babies learn by watching what you do, so set examples of behavior you expect. \n\n#### Use positive language to guide your baby.

How can \n\n## I be sure his adult teeth stay healthy? \n\n## Erupting permanent teeth cause the roots of baby teeth to be reabsorbed so that by the time they \n\n## are loose there is little holding them in place besides a small amount of tissue. Most children lose \n\n## their baby teeth in this order: \n\n## Baby teeth ordinarily are shed first at about age 6 when the incisors, the middle teeth in \n\n## front, become loose. \n\n## Molars, in the back, are usually shed between ages 10 and 12, and are replaced with permanent teeth by about age \n\n## 13. \n\n## Children usually wiggle their teeth loose with their tongues or fingers, eager to hide them under their pillow for the \n\n## \"tooth fairy.\" If your child wants you to pull out the already loose tooth, grasp it firmly with a piece of tissue or gauze \n\n## and remove it with a quick twist.

Being at home benefits both your child's and your family's emotional health. Caring for your baby at home \n\n## also helps reduce healthcare costs. \n\n## Back to Top \n\n\n### For home use, most babies get oxygen through a nasal cannula, a small tube that fits in your baby's nostrils and \n\n### secures around the head. In a small number of babies, oxygen is delivered through a tube in the neck called a \n\n### tracheostomy, a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine or a ventilator. \n\n### Your doctor will prescribe how much oxygen your baby needs. This is usually written as a specific flow rate (for \n\n### example, ¼ liter of oxygen per minute) when a nasal cannula is used. For a ventilator or CPAP machine, your doctor \n\n### will prescribe the settings you will need for the machine. \n\n## Home oxygen delivery systems \n\n### There are three main types of oxygen delivery systems used at home, including: \n\n### Compressed gas. This is the most common type. Small, pre-filled tanks of oxygen are delivered to your home before \n\n### your baby is discharged from the hospital. The number of tanks you get depend on how much oxygen your baby \n\n### needs. You may also get a big, non-portable gas tank.

A portable backup oxygen tank is needed, too, for times when your baby isn't near an electrical outlet \n\n### and just in case there's a power outage. \n\n### Liquid oxygen. Oxygen that has been cooled to a liquid state is stored in tanks. The liquid changes into gas as your \n\n### baby breathes it in. One of the reasons this system is not used as often is because liquid oxygen is expensive and \n\n### insurance companies may not cover the cost. A liquid oxygen tank takes up much less space than a large compressed \n\n### oxygen tank, but a big disadvantage of liquid oxygen is that it evaporates when it is not being used. \n\n## Other equipment \n\n### Depending on the reason your baby needs oxygen therapy, an apnea monitor or a pulse oximeter may be used. \n\n### An apnea monitor is a device that uses chest leads or best around the chest to monitor your baby's breathing rate and \n\n### heart rate. The machine alerts you when your baby's breathing rate slow or heart rate drops, which could be a sign of \n\n### respiratory distress. A pulse oximeter is a machine that uses a small band wrapped around your baby's hand or foot to \n\n### measure the oxygen levels in the blood. \n\n### You will receive instructions on how to use these machines before your baby leaves the hospital. Your doctor will also \n\n### explain what readings mean you need to call your health care provider. Keep in mind that an alarm may not always \n\n### signal distress, so it is important to look at your baby's breathing, color, and activity. \n\n## Safety precautions when using oxygen at home \n\n### Any time a baby is sent home from the hospital on oxygen, there are safety precautions you should follow: \n\n### Your baby's room should be well ventilated. You can keep the door open to ensure that the room has good air \n\n### flow and is not too stuffy. \n\n### There should be no smoking (/English/health-issues/conditions/tobacco/Pages/Importance-of-Smoke-Free","metadata":{"id":1531}}],["1532",{"pageContent":"### flow and is not too stuffy. \n\n### There should be no smoking (/English/health-issues/conditions/tobacco/Pages/Importance-of-Smoke-Free\n\n### Homes-and-Cars.aspx) in the house when a baby is receiving oxygen. You can hang a sign on the door to let \n\n### people know not to smoke in the house. Ask your medical equipment provider or your pediatrician's office for a \n\n### sign. \n\n### Oxygen is a flammable gas, so when your baby is on oxygen, keep your baby at least six feet away from open \n\n### flames, heaters, fireplaces, radiators or gas appliances with pilot lights. Make sure you also store all oxygen tanks \n\n### at least six feet away from any source of heat or fire. \n\n### Do not use rubbing alcohol, petroleum jelly or spray cans near a baby on oxygen.

Children under age 6 can't always tell the difference between fantasy and reality. Don't advertise to this age group, either, since young children can't tell paid ads apart from factual information. \n\n Show consequences.

Parents can create a Family Media Use Plan (/English/media/Pages/default.aspx) and model appropriate media use. Impartial ratings, such as those issued by Common Sense Media (https://www.commonsensemedia.org/), can help guide selection. \n\n Remember, your opinions count—make your voices heard.

Some babies spit up more than \n\n## others, or at certain times. \n\n## Typically, babies spit up after they gulp down some air \n\n## with breastmilk or formula. A baby's stomach is small \n\n## and can't hold a lot, after all. Milk and air can fill it up \n\n## quickly. \n\n## With a full stomach, any change in position such as \n\n## bouncing or sitting up can force the flap between the \n\n## esophagus (food pipe) and stomach to open.

Like a gas tank, fill baby's stomach it too full (or too fast) and it's going to spurt right back out \n\n##### at you. To help reduce the likelihood of overfeeding, feed your baby smaller amounts more frequently. \n\n##### Burp your baby more frequently.

To \n\n##### minimize the chances of this happening, burp not only after, but also during meals. \n\n##### Limit active play after meals and hold your baby upright. Pressing on a baby's belly right after eating can up \n\n##### the odds that anything in their stomach will be forced into action. While tummy time (/English/ages\n\n##### stages/baby/sleep/Pages/back-to-sleep-tummy-to-play.aspx) is important for babies, postponing it for a while \n\n##### after meals can serve as an easy and effective avoidance technique.","metadata":{"id":1548}}],["1549",{"pageContent":"##### stages/baby/sleep/Pages/back-to-sleep-tummy-to-play.aspx) is important for babies, postponing it for a while \n\n##### after meals can serve as an easy and effective avoidance technique. \n\n##### Consider the formula. If your baby is formula feeding (/English/ages-stages/baby/feeding\n\n##### nutrition/Pages/Amount-and-Schedule-of-Formula-Feedings.aspx), there's a possibility that their formula could \n\n##### be contributing to their spitting up. While some babies simply seem to fare better with one formula over another \n\n##### without having a true allergy or intolerance (/English/health-issues/conditions/abdominal/Pages/Milk\n\n##### Allergy.aspx), an estimated 5% of babies are genuinely unable to handle the proteins found in milk or soy \n\n##### formula―a condition called Cow Milk Protein Intolerance/Allery (CMPI and CMPA). In either case, spitting up \n\n##### may serve as one of several cues your baby may give you that it's time to discuss alternative formulas with your \n\n##### pediatrician. If your baby does have a true intolerance, a 1or 2-week trial of hypoallergenic (hydrolyzed) formula \n\n##### designed to be better tolerated might be recommended by your baby's provider. \n\n##### If breastfeeding, consider your diet. Cow's milk and soy in your diet can worsen spit up in infants with Cow \n\n##### Milk Protein Intolerance/Allergy (CMPI and CMPA).

It can help you recover from childbirth more quickly \n\n#### and easily. Hormones released during breastfeeding help the uterus to its regular size more quickly and can reduce \n\n#### postpartum bleeding. \n\n#### Likely because of hormonal changes, breastfeeding protects you against diabetes, high blood pressure and cancers of \n\n#### the breast and ovaries. It may also help keep bones strong, which helps protect against bone fractures in older age. It \n\n#### also triggers the release of oxytocin, a hormone that has been linked with feelings of empathy, affection, calmness and \n\n#### positive communication—all of which can help you be the warm, attentive parent you want to be. \n\n### Breastfeeding can save money & prep time \n\n#### Unlike formula, breast milk requires no purchase or preparation. Breastfeeding is also good for the environment, \n\n#### since there are no bottles to wash or formula cans to throw away. It’s wonderful, too, to be able to pick up the baby and \n\n#### go out—whether around town or on longer trips—without having to pack and carry a bag full of feeding equipment. \n\n#### And while you may want to invest in a breast pump to make feeding more convenient, the cost of buying or renting a \n\n#### pump will likely be less than a year’s supply of formula.

If you are giving your child \n\n#### only breast milk during this time, the baby is not yet six months, AND your period has not returned chances are good \n\n#### that you will not ovulate. (No ovulation, no pregnancy!) In fact, if you meet all three of these conditions, the level of \n\n#### contraceptive protection approaches 98%. \n\n## Overcoming challenges to breastfeeding \n\n### Finding expert support \n\n#### For many nursing parents and babies, breastfeeding goes smoothly from the start.

Hill, MD, FAAP \n\n## Parents are often shocked when I tell them that pediatricians think \n\n## it's a bad idea for children to watch TV or use mobile apps before \n\n## age 18 months, because most toddlers already have. Surveys tell us \n\n## that 92.2% of 1-year-olds have already used a mobile device, some \n\n## starting as young as age 4 months. \n\n## Early Brain Development \n\n## I hear a lot of parents say, \"But my baby likes it!\" Infants may stare at \n\n## the bright colors and motion on a screen, but their brains are \n\n## incapable of making sense or meaning out of all those bizarre \n\n## pictures. \n\n## It takes around 18 months for a baby's brain (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/How-Do-Infants-Learn.aspx) to \n\n## develop to the point where the symbols on a screen come to represent their equivalents in the real world. \n\n## What infants and toddlers need most to learn is interaction with the people around them. That doesn't mean that they \n\n## shouldn't video-chat with a distant grandparent or a deployed parent, but when it comes to day-to-day learning they \n\n## need to touch things, shake them, throw them, and most of all to see the faces and hear the voices of those they love \n\n## the most. Apps can teach toddlers to tap and swipe at a screen, but studies tell us that these skills don't translate into \n\n## real-world learning. See Healthy Digital Media Use Habits for Babies, Toddlers & Preschoolers (/English/family\n\n## life/Media/Pages/healthy-digital-media-use-habits-for-babies-toddlers-preschoolers.aspx). \n\n## Where's the Harm? \n\n## So sure, babies and toddlers don't get anything out of watching TV, but if they seem to like it, where's the harm?

Yes, watching TV is \n\n## better than starving, but it's worse than not watching TV. Good evidence suggests that screen viewing before age 18 \n\n## months has lasting negative effects on children's language development (/English/ages\n\n## stages/toddler/Pages/Language-Delay.aspx), reading skills, and short term memory. It also contributes to problems \n\n## with sleep (/English/healthy-living/sleep/Pages/Healthy-Sleep-Habits-How-Many-Hours-Does-Your-Child\n\n## Need.aspx) and attention. \n\n## If \"you are what you eat,\" then the brain is what it experiences, and video entertainment is like mental junk food \n\n## for babies and toddlers. \n\n## The problem lies not only with what toddlers are doing while they're watching TV; it's what they aren't doing. \n\n## Specifically, children are programmed to learn from interacting with other people. The dance of facial expressions, \n\n## tone of voice, and body language between a toddler and parent is not only beautiful, it's so complex that researchers \n\n## have to record these interactions on video and slow them down just to see everything that's going on.

Talk with your pediatrician about when your baby may be ready for solid foods. \n\n## Is it safe to get breast milk from a friend or online group? \n\n#### We can't know for sure whether breast milk from a friend or online group is safe (/English/news/Pages/New-AAP\n\n#### Recommendations-Aim-to-Ensure-Safe-Donor-Human-Milk-Available-for-High-Risk-Infants-Who.aspx).

Many imported \n\n#### formulas use milliliter (ml) rather than ounce (oz) in the mixing directions. If your baby bottles don’t have ml scale \n\n#### markings, you may have to convert (https://www.fda.gov/media/158832/download)from ounces to milliliters. Too \n\n#### much or too little water used with powder or concentrate is dangerous for your baby. \n\n#### It is also important to select the right imported formula for your baby’s age. Imported formulas may be labeled as \n\n#### \"Stage 1\" (for the first six months after birth, but generally can be used throughout the first year), and \"Stage 2\" (just for \n\n#### babies who are over 6 months of age). \n\n## Can toddler \"formula\" substitute for regular baby formula? \n\n#### Toddler drinks, often found in the formula aisles, are not recommended for infants.

Soy milk may be an \n\n#### option to give babies who are close a year old during the shortage, but not for more than one week. If you can't find \n\n#### formula and have to use soy milk, be sure to buy the kind that is fortified with calcium and vitamin D.

You \n\n## may have already experienced the beginnings of this process during the first half year of life as \n\n## your baby learned to enjoy drinking expressed breast milk from a bottle or cup and you began to \n\n## go places without her. Still, the two of you were closely tied to each other in a nutritional sense: \n\n## your child thrived on your breast milk alone, which provided the nutrients she needed. \n\n## During the second half of the year, your breast milk will continue to provide the great majority of \n\n## necessary nutrients as she starts to sample a variety of new foods. Though your baby will no \n\n## doubt greatly enjoy the introduction of new tastes and textures in her life, her experiences with solid food are still just \n\n## practice sessions for the future. It’s important to make sure she continues getting enough breast milk to meet her \n\n## nutritional needs. \n\n## Introducing foods \n\n## The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breastfeeding as the sole source of nutrition for your baby for \n\n## about 6 months. When you add solid foods to your baby’s diet, continue breastfeeding until at least 12 months. You \n\n## can continue to breastfeed after 12 months if you and your baby desire. Check with your child’s doctor about vitamin \n\n## D and iron supplements during the first year. \n\n## Parents with food allergies are often advised to avoid foods that commonly cause allergic reactions (such as cow’s \n\n## milk, dairy products, and foods made from peanuts or other nuts).

The loss \n\n## of the tonguethrusting reflex that causes food to be pushed out of her mouth is another indication that she’s ready to \n\n## expand her taste experience. \n\n## First foods \n\n## Since most breastfeeding babies’ iron stores begin to diminish at about six months, good first choices for solids are \n\n## those rich in iron. Current recommendations are that meats, such as turkey, chicken, and beef, should be added as one \n\n## of the first solids to the breastfed infant’s diet. Meats are good sources of high-quality protein, iron, and zinc and \n\n## provide greater nutritional value than cereals, fruits, or vegetables. \n\n## Iron-fortified infant cereal (such as rice cereal or oatmeal) is another good solid food to complement breast milk. \n\n## When first starting infant cereal, check the label to make sure that the cereal is a singleingredient product—that is, \n\n## rice cereal or oatmeal—and does not contain added fruit, milk or yogurt solids, or infant formula.

He watches everything that happens \n\n## around him, but rarely demands attention himself. \n\n## Left on his own, he sleeps for long periods and eats \n\n## infrequently. \n\n## The second baby is fussy and startles easily. He \n\n## thrashes his arms and legs, moving almost \n\n## constantly whether awake or asleep. While most \n\n## newborns sleep (/English/healthy\n\n## living/sleep/Pages/healthy-sleep-habits-how-many-hours-does-your-child-need.aspx) 14 hours a day, he sleeps \n\n## only 10, and wakes up whenever there’s the slightest activity nearby.

One is no \"better\" than the other, but because their personalities \n\n## (/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/Emotional-and-Social-Development-4-7-Months.aspx) are so far apart, the two will \n\n## be treated very differently, right from birth. \n\n## Discovering unique personality traits \n\n## Your baby will show many unique personality traits from the earliest weeks after birth.

They may be extra sensitive to light (/English/ages\n\n## stages/baby/Pages/Your-Baby%27s-Vision-1-Month.aspx), sound and touch, and these stimuli may cause them to \n\n## become fussy and look away. When this happens, it’s up to the parent to stop and wait until the baby is alert and ready \n\n## for more attention. Eventually most of these early reactions will fade away, and the baby’s own natural character traits \n\n## will become more evident. \n\n## Babies who are less than 5.5 pounds or 2.5 kg at birth (low birth weight), even if they’re full term, also may be less \n\n## responsive than other newborns.

They can take off some clothes, and use their fingers to turn doorknobs and pages of a book. \n\nThe way they play (/English/family-life/power-ofplay/Pages/default.aspx) is more advanced as well. Children this age love to act out things they see family members do. They may pretend to feed a doll or talk on a phone. They like routine and order, lining up toys and even categorizing them. They may request the same story at bedtime over and over. Children this age like to play independently but also collaborate sometimes. They may play next to other children one moment, and with them the next. \n\nYour child may have more to say these days, as 30-month-olds use words more to communicate. Their vocabulary has expanded to about 50 words (https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/actearly/milestones/milestones-30mo.html), and they use phrases of two or more words.

Don't hesitate to ask about your child's health, development, or behavior. Your pediatrician can offer advice on further evaluations if they are needed, and refer to specialists if warranted.

For many kids, it has meant being able to talk and play with friends virtually during school closings \n\n## and isolation at home. But the pandemic also showcased the downsides of more time online. Many children have \n\n## stumbled upon age-inappropriate videos, for example, or had creepy encounters with people online. Others are unable \n\n## to put the device down when it's time to do something else. \n\n## How are cell phones different than other devices? \n\n## All of this raises the question: Lots of kids have access to tablets and computers, so how are phones different?

Whether you are \n\n## grocery shopping or buying birthday gifts, these excursions can be fun and exciting for youngsters in middle \n\n## childhood.

It is lots of fun to \n\n## take turns reading aloud, and to let the children hear the stories and songs you enjoyed when you were growing up. \n\n## Holiday Traditions \n\n## These are another source of fun family activities. By learning about the history, significance, and rituals of a particular \n\n## holiday, children will feel a greater sense of involvement in the holiday preparations and celebrations. \n\n## Spiritual Pursuits \n\n## For many families, religion plays an important role in providing a moral tradition, a set of values, and a network of \n\n## friends and neighbors who can provide support.

Read on \n\n## for information from the American Academy of \n\n## Pediatrics about developmental milestones for your \n\n## preterm baby. \n\n## Keep in mind that babies develop at their own speed \n\n## and in their own way. However, parents of preemies will \n\n## need to adjust their baby's age to get a true sense of \n\n## where their baby should be in his development. \n\n## How to calculate your baby's adjusted age \n\n## Subtract the number of weeks your baby was born early from your baby's actual age in weeks (number of weeks \n\n## since the date of birth).

You will also know whether he needs more help. \n\n## Remember to take your child to his recommended well-child (health supervision) visits.
